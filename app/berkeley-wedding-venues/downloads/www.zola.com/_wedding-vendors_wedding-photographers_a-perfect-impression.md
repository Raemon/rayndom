  * ### A Perfect Impression 

•Verified review

•Lizzie S.•Oct 27, 2025

We worked with API for our wedding in September, and are so happy with the experience and with how the photos turned out. The process of executing the contract and preparing the shot list was straightforward, and API staff were available to answer all questions or concerns we had. On the day of the wedding, we worked with the photographer Luke, and he went out of his way to ensure we had beautiful photos that captured our love and our personalities. We received our photos about 6 weeks later, and were AMAZED. We can’t wait to frame these photos and display them in our home for a lifetime. Thank you API!

•Elizabeth B.•Aug 3, 2025

A Perfect Impression was a great choice for our wedding photography. Their communication style was brief but thorough, ensuring we had all the information we needed without any unnecessary fluff. The quality of their work was excellent - they captured all the moments we wanted to remember from our special day. They helped us stay relaxed and really take the time to enjoy the experience, which was so valuable. The only area for potential improvement would be if the photographer was a bit more assertive during the group photos to help keep things moving efficiently. Overall, we're excited to see the final photos and are happy with the role A Perfect Impression played in making our wedding day so memorable.

We were thrilled with the service we received from A Perfect Impression for our wedding photography. From the very beginning, Carl and his team were quick to respond, clear in their communication, and highly professional. They demonstrated true enthusiasm for capturing our special day, and their patience and creativity shone through in the final photos. Carl even provided us with a few photos by the end of the night, which was such a thoughtful gesture to tide us over until the rest were edited. Carl was also incredibly friendly, which put us at ease throughout the process. We couldn't be happier with the value and quality of their work, and we highly recommend A Perfect Impression to any couple planning their wedding.

## Frequently asked questions

6 Answers

Ask them a question

### How many pictures will we get?

You can expect about 80 to 100 images per hour of photographing. But keep in mind this estimate varies depending on your wedding package, number of guests, venue type, and other factors.

### Do you have insurance?

We absolutely do! Just let us know if your venue requires a certificate of liability, and we'll send that over to them.

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

Typically, you’ll be able to view your photos online about 6 weeks after your wedding. You will receive a sharable link with all edited photos with the ability to download any or all photos you'd like.

### What’s your back-up plan if you can’t photograph our wedding as planned?

Within our studio we have 12 full time photographers to ensure we have the ability to cover every event we book. With this number in mind we limit our bookings to 10 weddings at a time, ensuring we have 2 in house backups as well as several sub contractors on call in case of any emergency.

### Do you also offer video services?

We do! As well as an in house photo team we have an in house video team that is currently 8 strong, we shoot every video with equipment far more advanced than required to ensure you receive the best quality possible. Every wedding booking has 2 team members minimum, and we run a constant 2 camera minimum, usually 3. Our equipment of choice are Sony FX-6s as well as several FX-3s for backup cameras.

### Do you work with assistants or other photographers?

We do! Our photo team, as well as video team, all edit as well as shoot together often. On several of our packages we will have multiple photographers shooting alongside one another to ensure every moment of your day is captured. Each of our photographers are meticulously trained in house to ensure we have a very cohesive shooting and editing style no matter who you're working with.
