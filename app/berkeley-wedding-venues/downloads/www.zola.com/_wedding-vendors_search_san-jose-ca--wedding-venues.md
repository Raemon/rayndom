From the moment we first reached out, the team was incredibly positive, creative, and responsive, which was so appreciated during the busy wedding planning process. On the day of, their warm, bright, and natural light-filled space with beautiful gold tones truly set the tone for our special day. They even have gold cutlery available on request (it's all in the details). Having dedicated day-of coordinators, Jennifer and Priscilla, was an absolute game changer - they were so helpful throughout the entire process, going above and beyond to ensure every detail was perfect. We couldn't have asked for a better wedding venue and highly recommend Eagle Ridge to any couple looking for an exceptional experience. Priscilla was our technical "day-of" coordinator, but both she and Jennifer had been so responsive every day leading up to the wedding, it felt like we had a coordinator every day! Btw, they did every single table setting for us the day before. Thank you again!”Zenab A., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/0e925fea-31e7-4353-bf5a-babd6e94c3ac?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/eagle-ridge-by-wedgewood-weddings)

![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We recently had our wedding at Suisun Valley Inn, and overall, it was a beautiful and memorable experience. One of the biggest highlights was being able to use the venue for three full days, which gave us extra time to relax and connect with our bridal party and loved ones. That extended access truly made a difference in how special the weekend felt. However, there were a few challenges that did impact our plans. The event barn, which was a key part of our original vision, was unfortunately not finished in time for our wedding. While we understand this was out of the owner’s control, we were disappointed that we were not refunded the full 2,000 deposit, especially since the change affected nearly every aspect of our day. Additionally, when we arrived, we were surprised to find the vineyard had been plowed without any prior notice. This forced another last-minute adjustment to our setup so we wouldn’t be facing a dirt lot. It would have been really helpful to have been told about that in advance. Despite these hiccups, the venue itself has so much potential and charm, and we did have a lovely wedding. I just hope some of these experiences can help future couples plan better or spark a few improvements from the venue for the future.”Analisa R., 8 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/024bd0c3-3769-4479-be04-a31009a3418e?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/suisun-valley-inn-at-monroe-ranch)

“We hosted our October 2023 Wedding Reception at The Tech Interactive and I highly recommend it to anybody who is looking for a unique (and literally interactive) venue. It was so much fun and our guests had a great time! We rented the entire lower level and they kept the galleries and exhibits open so our guests could play with them throughout the night! They were a hit during cocktail hour as well as for taking breaks from the dance floor (although we still always had plenty of people on the dance floor!) Our event was mostly adults with a handful of younger relatives, and everyone had a great time. The exhibits at The Tech Interactive are perfect for quick and fun interactions no matter how interested (or not interested) any individual guest was in science/technology. Our engineer friends had a great time with the Cyber Detectives activities, while even our least technically-inclined guests enjoyed playing around with things like the Jet Pack Chair and Solve For Earth. This was truly best of both worlds, as we didn't have to give up any of the "traditional" wedding elements to make room for the fun of the exhibits - our tables and decorations were set up beautifully, we still had appetizers and an open bar, and like I mentioned above, there were still always plenty of people on the dance floor! We actually didn't even need to decorate as much as we might have with a more "traditional" venue either, as the existing colors, lighting, and layout of The Tech make for a strong baseline to build from. Our primary contact was Lolita and she was extremely helpful and pleasant to work with. She was there with us every step of the way, from our initial tour to our reception itself. She made sure to consider exactly what we were looking for to make our wedding special and was extremely organized and great and communicating with us as well as our other vendors. She created a great layout based on our table count, dance floor size, and the space the caterer needed, and she and her team went above and beyond and worked with our caterer and coordinator to help set everything up between the public close time and the start of our event so that everything was perfect when our guests got there. They even let us customize the exterior lighting color of the building during our event. The physical location of The Tech Interactive is fantastic as well - right in downtown San Jose within walking distance of tons of hotels and two parking garages where The Tech validates. The city closed off Market Street right in front of The Tech relatively last minute for a public city event, but Lolita was on top of it and worked with us and our shuttle company to arrange for pickup and a smooth experience for our guests. In summary: If you're looking to do something unique with your wedding or event, I can't recommend The Tech Interactive enough. Lolita was fantastic to work with and our guests couldn't stop saying how it was one of the most fun weddings they had ever been to.”Steve W., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-tech-interactive)

“We had our wedding last November and Fogo de Chão was very helpful in every step of the way. We booked 3 rooms which was perfect for our small wedding. The staff was very helpful as well as the event and general manager. Food was delicious as always. Our ceremony ended early and the manager was nice accommodating our guests a little bit earlier while we got our photos taken. It was such a good experience that now my husband wants to celebrate our anniversary every year at Fogo de Chão.”Priscila H., 3 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/fogo-de-chao-san-jose-ca)

![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Boulder Ridge By Wedgewood Weddings was an absolute dream venue for our wedding. From the moment we began working with them, their communication was efficient, effective, helpful, and knowledgeable. The view from the ceremony sight was absolutely beautiful, the service was excellent, and the staff was extremely organized and attentive to our guests' needs. Angela, our coordinator, was an absolute pleasure to work with - she really took the time to get to know us as a couple and ensure our vision came to life seamlessly. Thanks to the high-quality vendors and well-thought out checklists provided by Wedgewood, our wedding day was low-stress and everything was set up perfectly prior to our arrival. We are so grateful to the entire team at Boulder Ridge for making our special day truly unforgettable.”Alex M., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/c501ce06-3657-4ad2-8560-a3dd8937ee01?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/boulder-ridge-by-wedgewood-weddings)
