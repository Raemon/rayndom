I’m Cherlyn (rhymes with Berlin). So nice to e-meet you! If we met in person and it wasn’t during a pandemic- I would probably hug you! I’m an introvert-extrovert and tend to ramble too much when I get nervous. In emails - I tend to use exclamation points a lot!! (and will agonize over my drafts of emails before sending them because they probably have one too many!!) My aim as your photographer is to provide a memorable experience where you two feel comfortable, taken care of, and get to fully enjoy your wedding day as much as possible with all your guests & loved ones - whether they be in real life or via livestream!

Community focused & love centered. I document your day as it naturally unfolds while being mindful, intentional and authentic to your story, the people you've chosen to celebrate with and all the emotions of the day.

  * ### Chasing the Light

•Verified review

•Bryan•Jun 10, 2025

We worked with Cherlyn for our engagement and our wedding, and could not have asked for a better photographer. First and foremost, her photos are amazing. All of our family and friends who are into photography are impressed by her skills. Her ability to "chase the light" and capture those special moments led to many breathtaking photos. More importantly, Cherlyn made us feel comfortable throughout our photoshoots, especially since we are not the most extroverted couple. With her direction, we managed to look natural in our posed and candid photos, which is not an easy feat. We also appreciate how quickly Cherlyn works, as she sent over sneak peaks mere days after our engagement and our wedding. It was easy to communicate with her throughout the planning process, and we cannot thank her enough for her support. We highly recommend Cherlyn as the photographer for your event.

  * ### Cherlyn is the best!

•Verified review

•Ollie R.•Jun 2, 2025

We absolutely loved working with Cherlyn as our wedding photographer! From start to finish, she made everything feel so natural and comfortable. Her friendly and easygoing personality really put us at ease during the shoots, which made for authentic and beautiful photos. Cherlyn was fantastic at giving thoughtful feedback and had wonderful input on the flow of the day. On top of that, she was very responsive and timely with delivering photos, which made the entire experience smooth and stress-free. She truly captured all the special moments with such care and creativity. We couldn’t be happier with how everything turned out and would highly recommend her to anyone looking for a talented and personable photographer!

  * ### Straight out of a movie

•Verified review

•Maesy•Feb 1, 2025

C Wagner Photography & Design LLC was an absolute pleasure to work with for our wedding. Their communication was clear, organized, and incredibly responsive throughout the entire process. The quality of their work was exceptional - the photos captured our special day perfectly, exactly how we had envisioned. They made our wedding day at City Hall flawless and easy with their expertise and familiarity with the process. Cherlyn's documentary-style photography style resulted in beautiful, candid shots that we will cherish forever. We couldn't be happier with C Wagner Photography & Design LLC and highly recommend them to any couple planning their wedding.

  * ### Cherlyn did an awesome job!

•Verified review

•Kristin B.•Jan 13, 2025

Cherlyn captured our elopement in November 2024 at Timber Cove Inn. Since this was a second wedding for both of us, and was very small (just us and our kids) we wanted to keep things simple, focusing on the beauty of the landscape with a simple, sweet ceremony. Cherlyn absolutely nailed it - she captured the vibe we were going for perfectly and the photos are absolutely stunning! I could not be happier with the photos and the experience as a whole. She made us so comfortable and that led to great photos where we look at ease, which is just how we felt.
