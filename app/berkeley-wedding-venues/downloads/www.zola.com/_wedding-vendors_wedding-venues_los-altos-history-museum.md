  * ### A Seamless, Magical Day Thanks to Lisa

•Verified review

•Christa•Nov 16, 2025

If you’re considering getting married at the Los Altos History Museum—do it, and make sure you work with Lisa. She made us feel taken care of in every way. When it looked like rain, she calmly walked us through backup options and made everything feel manageable. When we needed help, she had answers before we even finished the question. The most memorable part? She hand-crafted the golf-themed signage for our wedding. It was a masterpiece and became one of the most talked-about details of the entire night. Lisa made our day magical, personal, and seamless. We are forever grateful.

Response from vendor•Nov 17, 2025

Christa, WOW. What else can or needs to be said? Your day, similar to the two of you was, perfect. Just the right amount of lighthearted, well-timed comedy, a heaping dose of love and sincerity and the cherry on top? The kindest people to celebrate. Even when we were figuring out what to do during the weather forecast debacle, you two were so lovely to work with. I will always remember your eye for design and maximalist tendencies forever fondly. You took this lovely space and somehow found a way to make it even more cozy, trendy, and oozing with beauty. Looking forward to when I see you both again. Please, don't be a stranger!

  * ### this is probably the perfect venue for your event 

•Verified review

•Liz•Nov 11, 2025

Bride’s Perspective Our wedding was a candlelit pizza party in the garden—casual, approachable, and elegant all at once. About 80 guests came. The ceremony was under the tree near the entrance. During cocktail hour, some guests (especially families with kids) enjoyed docent-led tours of the house. For dinner, we seated everyone at two long banquet tables on the bricks. While a lot of us were dancing inside, guests also gathered outside around the heaters under blankets we provided. The venue’s gardens and old trees meant we needed very little décor — we went with some DIY Trader Joe’s flowers & lots of candles. When the sun set, the glow from the candles and string lights provided by LAHM was magical. One highlight was cutting the cake at the end of the tables, looking out at our laughing, candlelit guests. We expected warm October weather, but the forecast dipped into the low 60s. Propane heaters worked perfectly, and combined with candles, lights, and blankets, the night felt intimate and warm. We live close to the venue and got ready at home, which turned out to be ideal—relaxed, convenient, and comfortable. Before planning, I imagined a rustic barn wedding, while my husband wanted something elegant. The museum was the perfect balance — and better than either of us pictured. Working with Lisa was wonderful. She was professional, responsive, and calm from the first walkthrough through the end of the night. I enjoyed checking in with her throughout the event, and everything ran smoothly. We trusted her recommendations and appreciated how she coordinated with all our vendors. We joke that if we ever got married again, we’d do it all the same — same space, same people, same Lisa! Groom’s Perspective We knew our venue search was over when we found the Los Altos History Museum. Lisa, the venue coordinator, not only manages a beautiful space but also brings clarity with straightforward policies and transparent pricing, which gave us freedom to design the day exactly how we wanted. The event moved naturally through the property: ceremony under the trees, cocktails near the house, dinner on the bricks, and dancing inside. It felt private but accessible, and the gardens were perfect for photos. My favorite moment was watching the sun set over dinner as candles and string lights took over. Lisa was fantastic — responsive, flexible, and organized. She met with our vendors in advance and made space to store supplies several days ahead of the wedding. She was the first to arrive and last to leave. She even helped pack our car at the end of the night. A few notes for future couples: there’s limited getting-ready space (we used our home, which worked great), tenting for rain can be tricky and expensive, and there’s no commercial kitchen. None were issues for us, and Lisa explained these points to us early so there were no surprises.

Liz and Jan, thank you so, so much for the kind words. I remember our tour like it was yesterday! How we already did the thing I will never know. You both were amazing to work with throughout the entire process. I will remember how kind, patient, and flexible you both were as we got further into planning! It was indeed the perfect event, and I remember it as such, always. Please don't be a stranger - you're members now ;)

  * ### The Perfect Choice! 

•Verified review

•Taylor R.•Nov 3, 2025

Los Altos History Museum is the perfect backdrop for an outdoor wedding — lush gardens, picturesque, and effortlessly romantic. Every corner of the property feels thoughtfully curated, creating endless opportunities for beautiful photos and memorable moments. On top of the gorgeous space, the venue manager, Lisa, is truly exceptional. Her professionalism, calm guidance, and attention to detail make the planning process seamless and stress-free. With Lisa and this stunning courtyard as your setting, every wedding feels flawless and unforgettable.

Response from vendor•Nov 5, 2025

I am so glad you have had such a positive experience working here as a planner! There is so much work that goes into planning an event, and I greatly appreciate vendors like yourself that make the day, my life, and the couple's experience that much better. We have had so many amazing events together, and I always get excited when a couple lets me know that they are working with you!

•Kelly M.•Nov 3, 2025

The Los Altos History Museum was perfection. From the very beginning, the event manager Lisa was responsive, warm, and incredibly helpful in making our vision a reality. She worked seamlessly with our vendors to ensure the day ran smoothly, and her knowledge of wedding best practices and attention to detail was incredible. The museum itself is both beautiful and functional— the ability to flip the ceremony space into the reception (all with furniture rentals from the museum!) while our guests enjoyed cocktail hour in the back of the same property made for an easy, enjoyable guest experience. The twinkly lights over the lush greenery created a lovely backdrop, and our guests also loved the opportunity to check out the museum a bit too! With Lisa's guidance and enthusiasm, we were able to create an event that was stunning, unique and effortless for our guests, and an incredible value! We couldn't have asked for a better venue or better partner (again, s/o Lisa!) in planning our special day.

Response from vendor•Nov 3, 2025

Kelly, you are a gem! Truly had the absolute best time working with you two over this last year. From the day we met to you wedding day it was all laughs and so much fun. I really appreciate both of your abilities to stay organized and knock all the things out and stay in contact the whole way through. I will always look back on your wedding day with so much joy. You both were beaming and were so sincere in every part of the day. It was so lovely to see your families come together and to share the space in which you made so many memories. I cannot wait to see you both again. Your day was just as beautiful as you both are!
