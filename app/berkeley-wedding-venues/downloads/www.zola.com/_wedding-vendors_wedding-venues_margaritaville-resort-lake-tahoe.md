  * ### Wedding Reception 

•Verified review

•Amy C.•Aug 14, 2025

Margaritaville Resort Lake Tahoe was an absolute delight to work with for our wedding. Their communication style was expressive, personal and engaging from our very first interaction. The team's attention to detail and local networking shone through, as they seamlessly coordinated all the logistics to ensure our special day flowed effortlessly. The functionality of the venue and its stunning lakeside setting worked in perfect harmony, creating an unforgettable experience for us and all our guests. We couldn't have asked for a better venue to celebrate our daughters marriage, and we highly recommend Margaritaville Resort Lake Tahoe to any couple planning their dream wedding.
