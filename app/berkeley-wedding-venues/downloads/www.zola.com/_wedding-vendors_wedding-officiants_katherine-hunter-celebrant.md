Katherine Hunter is a wedding officiant based in the Lehigh Valley of eastern Pennsylvania. She has specialized in custom, (mostly) non-religious wedding ceremonies since 2017. A long-time LGBTQ ally, she joyfully celebrates all love!

My foremost goal as a wedding officiant is to help you. You've probably never done this before, and you probably don't have a super clear picture of what your ceremony will feel like. That's totally normal, and there are many ways I can help! I already know you want it to be simple but meaningful, touching but also fun. I'm here to help you figure out everything to do with your ceremony, put you at ease, and make it feel authentic to who you are. I can't wait to hear from you!

**In three words:** Calm, Collaborative, Supportive

  * ### Unforgettable!

•Verified review

•Amy A.•Jan 8, 2026

Choosing Katherine as our wedding officiant was one of the best decisions we made. She didn’t just officiate our wedding-she told our story with warmth, authenticity and heart. She took the time to truly know us, worked closely with us on every detail and encouraged us to shape the ceremony together. What she delivered was unforgettable. Guests still tell us it was the most personal and emotional ceremony they’ve ever experienced. There were tears even from the toughest guys in the room. Months later people are still talking about how moving it was. If you want a ceremony that people will remember forever, look no further.

•Steph R.•Nov 29, 2025

If you're looking for a unique, custom wedding ceremony, I highly recommend Katherine Hunter! When we first started planning our wedding, we knew that we wanted a non-religious ceremony but we weren't sure where to look. We enjoyed working with Katherine throughout the wedding planning process. She was responsive whenever we had questions and she was patient as we were navigating a lot of life changes while we planned our wedding. At the beginning of the planning process, we filled out questionnaires and Katherine used them to create the perfect custom ceremony for us. Throughout the process, we were able to review drafts of the ceremony and make any changes we felt were necessary. We loved how our final wedding ceremony was a true representation of us as both individuals and as a couple.

Response from vendor•Dec 1, 2025

Thank you so much for this generous review, Steph! It was such fun working with you both to shape a ceremony that reflected your values, your story, and your dynamic. I’m glad the way we went about things felt supportive during a hectic time of planning and life changes. Hearing that your ceremony felt like a true reflection of you - as individuals and as a couple - means the world. Thank you for trusting me and allowing me to be a part of such a meaningful moment. Wishing you both all the very best in the years to come!

## Frequently asked questions

5 Answers

Ask them a question

### Can we personalize our ceremony?

Yes, absolutely. No matter how big or small your wedding, it's personal! Couples who work with me tend to be more interested in making every aspect of their day feel authentic to them, rather than strict traditions. Together the two of you are one-of-a-kind, and your wedding ceremony should be too. No tired scripts here!

### Do you do rehearsals? Is that included in your cost?

Yes and no. While I'm happy to support your physical rehearsal, many wedding venues roll this service into their package, and I don't want to double charge you! If I'm available on the date of your physical rehearsal, I'll be happy to lead it for an additional fee of $300. I love doing physical rehearsals, and I promise you that no one else will be more invested in the success of your ceremony than I will be. My Signature Ceremony package includes the Virtual Rehearsal at no additional fee.

### How many weddings have you done?

As of early 2025, about 250 weddings with ZERO lost rings!

### We’re legally married already. Can you still do our ceremony?

Sure can! And I can keep a secret if you don't want anyone to know. While it may not be the day you legally tie the knot, nothing about your ceremony has to be any different.

### Do you provide or require premarital counseling?

Nope. I'm not qualified as a counselor and I'm not an ordained minister. If you're two consenting adults, ready to be legally married with a valid marriage license, then I'm here to help you make it official.
