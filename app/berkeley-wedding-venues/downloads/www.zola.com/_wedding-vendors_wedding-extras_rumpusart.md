  * ### Live Sketch Artist was a hit! 

•Verified review

•Mountain Thyme E.•Dec 17, 2025

RumpusART was an absolute pleasure to work with for our wedding! Their communication was professional, seamless, and fun throughout the entire planning process. The quality of their work and the value they provided was truly top-notch - they brought a "wedding WOW factor" with their unique and fun creations. The keepsake they made for our friends and family was a timeless piece that captured the spirit of our special day. Veronica, the owner, is a true talent and made the whole experience so enjoyable. I couldn't recommend RumpusART highly enough for any couple looking to add a fun and memorable touch to their wedding day!

  * ### The highlight of the day!!

•Verified review

•Tiffany•Nov 21, 2025

Veronica brought such a creative and engaging element to my event with her interactive painting experience. She offered several thoughtful ideas, and we ultimately chose one where she provided a beautiful sketch along with paints and brushes, inviting attendees to add their own touches throughout the day. Guests absolutely loved it—it sparked conversations, laughter, and genuine connection as people contributed their own creativity to the piece. After the event, Veronica took the collaborative painting home and reworked it into an artwork that perfectly captures the spirit of the day. It’s now a meaningful, one-of-a-kind piece that I’ll cherish forever. Her ability to combine art, community, and memory-making is truly special. I couldn’t recommend her enough!

Veronica was professional, talented, and engaging. Her ability to capture a special moment in time seemed to come very naturally. Her images captured the essence of the people in attendance and left us with a unique and authentic gift to remember the experience. I highly recommend!!
