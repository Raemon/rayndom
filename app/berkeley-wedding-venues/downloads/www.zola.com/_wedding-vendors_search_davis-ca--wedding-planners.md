The Orange Dragonfly Weddings and Events 5.0

  * Offers 6 services
  * Starts at $1,500 
  * Serves Davis, CA

Orange Dragonfly Weddings & Events is a mother-daughter team passionate about creating beautifully curated celebrations that reflect each couple’s unique story. We blend creativity, organization, and heart into every detail — from the first planning meeting to the last dance. With a balance of modern design and timeless style, we bring your vision to life in a way that feels effortless and authentically you. At Orange Dragonfly, we believe every wedding should feel personal, joyful, and unforgettable — and we’re here to make that happen.“Kristina and Susan were hands down the best decision that my husband and I made in our wedding process. I hit the ground running once we got engaged and was about 8 months into the journey when I started wondering what I was doing with myself and panicking about all of the details that I was still needing to figure out. After exploring various options in terms of wedding planning, I found The Orange Dragonfly and from there the rest was history! Right after I met with Kristina and Susan, we were automatically at ease. No matter what questions we had or details we needed help with, they were there and ready to guide us. They did not only make everything leading up to the big day feel far less daunting, but the day of the wedding went by seamlessly thanks to them and their abundance of care and attention to detail. There were of course small and unexpected changes that popped up on the wedding day, but we never felt a single worry or stress because of our confidence that they had it taken care of. On top of this, throughout the whole day and night, they went out of their way to make sure that Alex and I took breaks to soak everything in and even kept grabbing us drinks from the bar and ensuring that we had what we needed. I could honestly write an entire novel just singing their praises, but the bottomline is that you could never regret trusting your wedding with these lovely ladies! We are so blessed and thankful for all of their help and support. Thank you, Kristina and Susan!”Hannah K., a month ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/the-orange-dragonfly-weddings-and-events)

Teague Events 5.0 Davis, CA

  * Offers 6 services

Teague Events provides full-service event planning, embracing the art of design and delivering exquisitely executed events. With our passion for flawless implementation and heightened guest experiences, we ensure your event is an unforgettable celebration of your love story. Based in Northern California, we have some of the best locations and talent at our fingertips, though we’ll travel wherever our couples wish to wed.“Professionalism Working with Stephanie at Teague Events was one of the best decisions we made for our wedding. From the beginning, she was incredibly timely and responsive—always replying quickly and thoroughly to any question we had. She went above and beyond by joining us for vendor meetings and venue tours, even when her presence wasn’t strictly necessary, just to make sure nothing slipped through the cracks. Her extensive network of vendor connections gave us high-quality options that fit both our vision and our budget. Stephanie also shared practical tips on how to keep things budget-friendly, which allowed us to save without ever feeling like we were cutting corners. Her professionalism and commitment made us feel supported and confident every step of the way. Design & Aesthetic Stephanie has very sophisticated and aesthetic taste, and she elevated the vision we had for our wedding day while staying within our budget (which was tight). She personally helped arrange the table decorations so that everything looked cohesive, balanced, and elegant. The overall design reflected us perfectly as a couple, and with her touch, it felt elevated, intentional, and beautiful. Every detail was thoughtful, and she managed to create a stunning look without ever straying from the financial boundaries we set. Execution on the Big Day When it came to the big day, Stephanie’s execution was flawless. She anticipated things we didn’t even know to think about—for example, our 95-degree heat could have ruined the flowers, but because she ensured each bloom had its own water source, the arrangements stayed fresh through dinner. Our decorations were exactly as my wife envisioned, but even more stunning with the little touches Stephanie added. She set up our welcome table with minimal instruction (literally just a messy sketch and a box of random pictures, flowers, and decor) and turned it into something beautiful. She seamlessly coordinated a surprise serenade I performed for my wife, ensuring it was timed and staged perfectly. Stephanie executed her job extremely efficiently without ever drawing unnecessary attention to herself, working quietly in the background to keep everything moving smoothly. Every detail was handled with calm precision, allowing us to fully relax and enjoy the day. Stephanie made our wedding seamless, stunning, and unforgettable.”Catherine H., 5 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/teague-events)

I'll help guide you through the process so you understand how to focus your budget on the things that are important to YOU, and help you put together a cohesive design that reflects YOUR unique vibe!

From the moment we first spoke with her, she made us feel comfortable and confident that we would have a smooth wedding planning experience and stress free wedding day. Although the stress is inevitable, Ali lifted a ton of weight off of our shoulders the entire last month leading up to our wedding and the wedding day was more beautiful than we could’ve imagined. Our only regret was not choosing full service planning with Ali and only going with month-of! We can't imagine the process going smoothly without Ali and her team and highly recommend her to all of our friends and family. She helped us more than we could have ever hoped – from always being available to give us advice on any decisions we had to make, big or small, to making sure we truly were able to enjoy and not worry about anything but being present on our wedding day. There are so many behind-the-scene logistical challenges that we did not even notice until we thought about it after the wedding and realized were handled by her team. We were able to trust her 100% in any stylistic choices because we know she has a good eye for aesthetics and making our vision come to life. She took the time and effort to learn what we as a couple uniquely like, and made sure that everything was perfect on the wedding day. Ali’s experience and advice are what makes her planning invaluable, even the smallest things you might not think about can make such a big difference on how the day pans out. We genuinely don’t think our wedding would have been possible without her and her expert team!”Analisa S., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/5114555f-746d-4089-b340-583ccfb7aab7?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/ab-event-co)

Our wedding at Orchard Creek Lodge on August 16, 2025, was absolutely perfect — and we owe so much of that to Judi and the incredible team at To Have and To Hold Wedding Planning. From the very beginning, Judi was a dream to work with. She was endlessly patient, incredibly sweet, and always made us feel like our vision truly mattered. Throughout the entire planning process, Judi guided us with such grace and calm, even when we were overwhelmed with decisions. Her eye for detail is unmatched — every flower, every table setting, and every timeline detail was flawless. She anticipated things we never would have thought of and made sure the day ran seamlessly from start to finish. One of the highlights of our planning journey was our monthly check-in calls with Judi. My husband and I genuinely looked forward to them every time! She made each meeting fun, organized, and reassuring — turning what could have been a stressful process into something we actually enjoyed. What stood out most was how genuinely caring and kind Judi was. She went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable, happy, and stress-free. We truly felt supported every step of the way, and it’s clear that she pours her heart into what she does. Our wedding day was everything we dreamed of and more, and we couldn’t have done it without her. Judi will always hold a special place in our hearts — she is the wedding planner every bride and groom deserves! Thank you, Judi, for making our special day unforgettable!

From the very beginning, she was extremely thorough, organized, and attentive to every single detail. She kept us informed and reassured through every step of the planning process, always one step ahead and never missing a beat. What makes Sandy truly exceptional is not just her professionalism, but her heart. In the middle of planning, we were faced with the sudden and unexpected loss of a parent—a devastating and emotional time. Sandy handled everything with such compassion and grace, stepping in seamlessly to manage the moving parts when we needed to step back. She was our rock, quietly making sure everything stayed on track while allowing us the space to grieve and heal. On the day of the wedding, Sandy brought it all together flawlessly. Every extra touch we had dreamed of, every tiny detail we hoped someone would remember—she did. And more. She created a weekend that felt not just organized, but magical. It was truly the best weekend of our lives, and we owe so much of that to her.

Our goal was to make our guests feel taken care of. Good food, good drink, good company; bringing the most important people in our lives together to celebrate our relationship and really understand us as a couple. That’s a big ask for a wedding. We trusted Amy to help us get the job done and she absolutely delivered. We booked her partial planning option. Our initial meetings with her, and all of the advice and tools she provided helped us navigate the process very cleanly. We always felt like we could reliably get our questions answered. More important though, she helped us understand what questions we should be asking in the first place, what was important, what was a priority, and what wasn’t. From there, meeting with her virtually and in person at our venue she was ON IT. She was a sponge for information: soaking up every idea, question, or anxiety, and addressing each with her deep experience and expertise. We went into our day confident in the plan we put together, and with an understanding of how things were being executed. That understanding did not prepare us for how blown away we would be by the quality of the job she and her team did on the day and in the lead up to it. Everything with our vendors was perfectly coordinated. Everything with the venue totally taken care of. We were providing a lot of the decor ourselves and her team picked up on and understood exactly what we were going for and assembled everything just as we planned it without any additional communication. They also seamlessly smoothed out and filled in any rough edges in our overall plan for the day, with little details we hadn’t considered identified and taken care of in thoughtful ways. If any small issues or problems popped up they were immediately handled with professionalism and grace. On top of that, Amy went above and beyond to make us and our guests feel special. She knew what was important to us, and made sure it happened. She was always there, but never in the way. A true professional. The day itself went off without a hitch and was better than we had even hoped. We knew this day would be special, but we didn’t realize just how special it would be for us, thanks to Amy and her team. And as fantastic as the process was, the end result was truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience, not only for us but for our guests as well.”Ben B & B., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/250b4459-2a31-48e8-882f-89394e6eab7b?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/amy-varain-weddings)

Maely's Events & Co. was founded by two best friends who both DIY'd and planned their weddings from the start, where they both fell in love with the art of wedding planning. The name Maely derives from Haley and Maegan, who would love to be your right hand during your special day!“We don’t know what we would have done without Maely’s Events. Whether it was helping us get our wedding timeline down to a T, being unbelievably available to us for any and all tasks leading up to the big day, making sure we didn’t get an ounce of stress from hosting the event day-of, and even driving us from the reception venue to our hotel, you guys MADE IT HAPPEN for us. We are big DIYers, and to our fellow DIYers out there wondering whether or not you can do without a Day-Of Wedding Coordinator, HIRE A DAY OF WEDDING COORDINATOR. But not just any company/person. Maely’s events is an absolute, hands-down, no-brainer. Their pricing is so fair, their dedication is UNMATCHED, they are so easy to work with, and they’re just kind people who want to help others have more relaxing weddings than they had (because the owners didn’t have wedding coordinators for their weddings). This mission-driven company is incredible, and I promise you will NOT regret hiring them! DO IT PEOPLE! We’re talking to you DIYers!!! It’s worth it—THEY are soooo worth it!! We could go on and on and on, thank you Haley and Maegan for making our special day happen even more magically than we could have dreamed. We’d hire you again and again.”Audrey & S., 15 days ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/maely-s-events-co)
