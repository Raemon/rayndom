Welcome, friends! I'm Anna. My team and I love not only to document love stories but to listen to and learn about our couples as well. It’s super important for us to get to know each other and be on the same page about our couple's vision to create honest, romantic, and playful moments through photos whether it be a portrait session or a wedding. Each love story we learn about inspires us to continue this passion and creative journey of mine to create timeless pieces of art that will be passed down for generations to come. All love stories are welcome. No story is too small, big, near, or far.

We aim to connect with our couples and fellow vendors through our experience and personality. We're pretty easy-going, calm, warm, and organized. Our goal is to hold a safe space for our couples to share their love story as true to them as possible which is why we like to include a complimentary engagement session with every wedding collection. I (Anna) also have a personal love of film and am currently offering optional complimentary 35mm film and mini/wide instant polaroids if I'm available to be a part of your day. We hope to connect with you soon! :)

## Frequently asked questions

8 Answers

Ask them a question

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically, couples book me about 6-12+ months before their wedding date. I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible about my availability, even if you’re planning on a shorter time frame.

### Do you work with assistants or other photographers?

Yes, for full-sized weddings I’ll bring one assistant photographer or more depending on the size of your wedding. This is included in all full wedding collections except intimate/micro-weddings which is optional to have a 2nd photographer.

### Will you edit all our pictures?

Definitely. All final images will be edited for color, saturation, exposure, and sharpness to ensure they look beautiful. I also offer retouching services like blemish removal and teeth whitening for an additional charge.

### Do you also offer video services?

No, I prefer focusing on photography only, so you can get the best wedding pictures possible. I can refer you to some awesome videographers that I know of/have worked with!

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

My turnaround time varies by season. Typically, I share sneak peeks within 1 week, and you’ll be able to view your photos online about 8 to 10 weeks after your wedding.

### How many pictures will we get?

You can expect about 75 to 100 images per hour of photography. Please keep in mind this estimate varies depending on your wedding package, number of guests, venue type, and other factors.

### Do you have insurance?

I do! Just let me know if your venue requires a certificate of liability, and I’ll send that over to them.

### What’s your back-up plan if you can’t photograph our wedding as planned?

In my 5 years of experience as a wedding photographer, I’ve never canceled a booking. In the very rare event that I’m unable to photograph your wedding, I’ll make sure you’re covered by one of my colleagues or my contracted assistant photographer. I’ll also provide you with a list of photographers from the many networking groups I’m in, so you can find the perfect replacement.
