I had zero issues working with them. I don't mean that in a way where there were small things I didn't like but looked over-NO. I truly had zero issues with both of them or any of the people on their team for the day of hair and make up services. Before my big day, I booked two separate hair and make up trials where I asked for completely different things and at either trials they both arrived on time and did exactly the look I asked for. Then, the WEEKEND OF my wedding I realized I couldn't exactly pick between the two different looks and I humbly asked if Josiah could somehow combine the two looks from my trials for a "soft glam" look and he delivered. I have never felt so pretty. Same exact situation with my hair. Josiah and Paige were so patient and friendly and kind! There team worked quickly and efficiently on the day of my wedding to do hair and make up for most of my bridal party plus my mother and my mother in law- and a surprise person who changed her mind from doing her own make up to asking for it done! We even got little personalized touch up kits to reapply any lipstick or pin up any additional hair. I highly highly recommend this team of amazing professionals. I never leave review s for anything but they all should be recognized for their dedicated work. Thank you forever to this team, specifically Josiah and Paige who helped me look and feel so beautiful on my special day.”Jessica S., 7 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/026d2490-e064-44d8-a26a-2028392374dd?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/awaken-beauty)

Raven Reed | Makeup & Hair is a San Francisco–based luxury bridal styling company serving Napa Valley, Carmel, and destinations worldwide. Led by founder Raven Reed, our team is known for refined, skin-forward artistry that photographs flawlessly and feels effortless in real life. Every experience is calm, intentional, and tailored to the woman in the chair—elevating her natural beauty rather than masking it. Whether preparing for an intimate elopement or a multi-day celebration, Raven and her artists bring an editorial eye and a deep respect for the moment, creating looks that are modern, timeless, and unmistakably you.“Raven did my bridal make up for my wedding in San Francisco in 2019 and she was absolutely amazing! About 2 years ago I faced the daunting situation of hunting for a make up artist in the US while living in Australia. This presented a number of obstacles but Raven never made it feel that way. She was always responsive and willing to go out of her way to talk with me or provide advice. But the best thing about Raven is that she genuinely cares about making her clients happy and will go the extra mile to make sure of that. At our make up trial, she refused to leave until she knew I was happy! A difficult task when working with someone like me who isn't used to wearing a lot of make up and hadn't had their make up done professionally since I was 18. Raven tackled this challenge with so much positive energy and never once made me feel guilty for not quite knowing what I wanted. And on the day Raven perfectly captured the natural, but polished look that I was after. I absolutely loved my make up and received so many compliments throughout the day and night.”Juliette, 5 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/raven-reed-luxury-bridal-beauty)

Hello! I'm Koryn Wirth, the owner of Klose-Up Beauty. I'm a wedding and special occasion hair and makeup in California and Florida. Willing to travel for events! We offer brides the option for traditional makeup or airbrush application. All brides also receive a complimentary touch up kit for their big day .“I had such a wonderful experience with Klose Up Beauty/ Koryn for my San Francisco City Hall elopement. She did my hair and makeup, as well as my fiancé’s hair, and I was so happy to find someone who offered services for the groom too—something I didn’t see often while searching. She was incredibly fast and helpful when it came to communication, answering all my questions and putting me at ease right from the start. On the day of the wedding, she made me feel so comfortable while getting ready and was very attentive to making sure I was happy with the look. She encouraged me to speak up if I wanted anything changed, which I really appreciated—it made the experience feel very collaborative and relaxed. Since I got ready alone for the elopement, it meant a lot that she also helped me with my dress and veil. That extra bit of support made such a difference and really showed how much she cares about her clients. I couldn’t have asked for a better experience—professional, warm, and truly thoughtful. Highly recommend her to anyone eloping or getting married in the area!”Melissa S., 7 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/b51da22b-ec83-4095-b73a-3d512599f635?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/klose-up-beauty)

Beauty stems from the inside and that’s where we start with our babes. We want our couples to feel like an elevated version of themselves. We are all about complimenting the mood and aesthetic of your wedding weekend while coming up with a custom look that brings it all together. With the mama wolf, Ash having over a decade of editorial and fashion experience, our work is more fashion-forward than “bridal”. Highlighting natural beauty above all. Because we work so closely with our photographers, we know how to help you feel photo ready while still feeling “approachable”. We are stoked to be considered for your beauty needs!“I hired Love Wolves Co for my hair and make up and had the best experience with them! Karen was my stylist and she did such an amazing job both for my engagement shoot and wedding day! As someone who never wears more than some mascara, she really allowed me to still feel natural and like myself while highlighting my features and ensuring my make up would photograph well. In fact, she did such a great job with make up for me and my bridesmaids that my step-mom (who typically hates getting her make up done) added that service day of! Knowing that my fine hair doesn’t hold well, I had Karen stay for a touch up right before my ceremony and couldn’t recommend that enough! Everyone loved working with her!”Anais P., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/love-wolves-co-beauty)
