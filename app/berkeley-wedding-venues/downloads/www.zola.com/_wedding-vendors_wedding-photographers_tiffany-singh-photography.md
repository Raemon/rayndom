As a Bay Area and Napa wedding photographer, I blend cinematic elegance with honest storytelling to create refined, emotive, and timeless imagery. From Napa’s vineyards to San Francisco’s iconic venues, I document your day with intention and an eye for meaningful, unscripted moments. With a calm, guided-yet-unobtrusive approach, I ensure you stay present while I capture the grand and intimate details that define your story. If you value genuine emotion and effortless luxury, I’d love to create something extraordinary together. Inquire to begin a tailored experience.

I specialize in capturing the true essence of your wedding—the stolen glances, spontaneous laughter, and quiet, heartfelt moments. My goal is to let you fully enjoy your day while I seamlessly preserve it with care and artistry. When you look back on your images, you’ll not just see your wedding—you’ll feel it. These are timeless memories, crafted to be cherished forever.

  * ### Tiffany is amazing!!

•Verified review

•Megan C.•Dec 15, 2025

From the very beginning, working with Tiffany Singh Photography was a dream. Tiffany's communication style is fast, helpful, and kind, which instantly put us at ease. The quality of her work is truly timeless, gorgeous, and fun. She helped us feel calm and confident in front of the camera, and her posing prompts felt effortless and natural. The photos she captured are absolutely stunning - emotional, beautifully done, and full of timeless moments from our special day. We couldn't be happier with Tiffany's services and we would recommend her to any couple without hesitation.
