My artistry centers on creating looks that feel fresh yet timeless — elevated, understated, and softly luminous. My signature style is skin-forward, breathable, and glow-enhancing, designed to elevate your natural beauty with a polished, skin-like finish that never feels heavy or overdone. I use luxury, high-performance products chosen for comfort, longevity, and flawless wear in every light. Above all, my goal is for your makeup to feel effortless and confidence-giving — enhancing who you are without ever feeling like too much.

At the heart of my work is a commitment to listening well and collaborating with care. I believe the most beautiful results come from truly understanding you — your style, your story, and how you want to feel on your wedding day. My intentional approach is never one-size-fits-all. Whether you have a clear vision or are still discovering it, I create looks that feel effortless, timeless, and authentically you. My hope is that you begin your day feeling cared for, confident, and completely yourself.

  * ### Simply the best!

•Verified review

TLDR: Sam is truly one of a kind. Incredibly talented, endlessly kind, and a total professional. I would recommend her 10/10 without hesitation. This review is long overdue. I first connected with Sam back in 2020 when I was searching for a makeup artist for my wedding in Sonoma, and from the minute I met her, I knew she was the person I wanted to work with. She was warm, thoughtful, organized, and so genuinely invested in understanding my vision and what would make me feel my best. Working with her for my wedding was an absolute dream. She completely exceeded expectations, and every single person she worked with that day could not stop talking about how amazing she was. The experience was seamless, calm, and fun, which is exactly what you want on such a big day. Since then, I have continued working with Sam for makeup lessons, different shoots, and more. Every experience has been just as wonderful. Even though I no longer live in the Bay Area, anytime I’m back I make it a point to carve out time to see her. Whether it’s to refresh my techniques, learn new trends, or honestly just to catch up, it’s always something I look forward to. She has such a gift for teaching and for making you feel confident, comfortable, and excited about makeup. Sam is one of those rare people who is not only extremely skilled at what she does, but also truly lovely to be around. I cannot recommend her highly enough!

Sam was everything I could have hoped for in a makeup artist and more. Throughout the whole process she was nothing but professional, thoughtful, intentional, and kind and on my wedding day it felt like I had another one of my friends by my side. She is truly an artist and made the whole bridal party look incredible. She brought out everyone’s natural beauty and had us all looking like elevated versions of ourselves all day and into the night. For someone who wears little to no makeup, I’m now thinking up any excuse to have my make up done again, to feel and look amazing, and just to hang out with Sam.

Response from vendor•Sep 29, 2025

Brittany! Aww reading this absolutely made my day—thank you from the bottom of my heart! It was such an honor to be part of your wedding and to share those moments with you and your bridal party. You and your loved ones were such a joy to work with, and I’m so grateful you trusted me to create a look that felt like the best version of you. I’d happily do your makeup any time—wedding or not—just to get to hang out again! 💕

Samantha was the Makeup Artist for our couple's wedding this past weekend and I can say that the Bride, Party and Family looked and felt amazing! It was a dreamy location, and Samantha definitely fit the vibe. As planners we really prep and hope that the artists are responsive and on time, if not it can really make for a hectic day. We didn't have to worry about her at all, it was quite refreshing and a beautiful start to the day.

Response from vendor•Aug 26, 2025

Thank you so much for this thoughtful review! It was such an honor to be part of such a beautiful day, and I truly loved seeing the bride and her loved ones feeling so radiant. Working alongside planners like you makes the morning flow with so much ease and joy—I’d be delighted to work together again in the future!

I can't begin to describe how wonderful, comfortable, and beautiful Samantha made me feel on my wedding day. I had a very small intimate family ceremony in Sea Ranch, Ca and every inch of that day was so spectacular and memorable part of which Samantha helped to create. She did a preview trail with me months before at her studio it was such a great time for us to connect and view what i wanted on my wedding day and my mother came with me as well. The moment I met sam and she began her magic i knew this was going to be a memory i would never forget and I picked the perfect person to do my hair and make up. She was so detailed in her craft asking what i liked what i didn't like what make up etc. One thing i loved about sam is she let me look in a mirror each step of the way to make adjustments. On my wedding day i felt so beautiful and comfortable and most importantly, I felt like myself just elevated! It was everything I wanted and more. Thank you Sam for everything! P.S. I found her on instagram for all my intsagram!

Response from vendor•Aug 25, 2025

Oh my goodness Lauren, thank you so much for this beautiful note! Reading this melts my heart! I’m so honored to have been part of your special day, and to help create such special memories for you and your family. It was such a joy connecting with you (and your mom!) during your preview, and I loved seeing your vision come to life on your wedding day. I'll never forget your mom's happy tears when she first saw you with the veil on! Hearing that you felt like yourself—just elevated—is exactly what I hope for every bride. Thank you for trusting me with your vision and for sharing your experience so beautifully. Sending so much love to you and your sweet family! xx
