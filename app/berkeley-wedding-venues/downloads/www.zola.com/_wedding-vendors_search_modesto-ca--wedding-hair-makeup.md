On-site traveling hair + makeup artist of 8 years based in the Greater Sacramento area and beyond!! Specializing in enhancing your features with natural and soft glam and giving you the hairstyle of your dreams for your big day!“Betty did such an amazing job. I honestly felt so beautiful on my day. She really listened to what I wanted as someone who is not a big makeup wearer, explained everything. My makeup held all day and night . Her communication was fabulous and even made last minute adjustments that I wanted. She does do a trial before hand, which really put my mind at ease since again I’m not a big makeup wearer and was totally unsure what I wanted. I would recommend her eveyday of the week. 10/10 amazing.

Working with me as your wedding makeup artist would not only include the makeup application itself but also around the clock email/ text communication from the very beginning of the booking process to the wedding day. My main priority is to ensure you have a smooth booking process with me and a stress-free wedding morning.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“I wanted to get Glam-Up for my best friend's birthday. Lauren responded super quickly after I submitted the request on her Instagram. I don't usually wear makeup and I didn't know exactly what I wanted so we discussed what type of makeup style and products that would look best and be the most compatible with my skin, hair, and outfit. She is very easy and so much fun to talk with and is very knowledgeable. She listened to what I roughly wanted and offered her advice in a considerate manner. On the day of the appointment, she was on time and kept to the schedule. She was incredibly professional, efficient, and accommodating. Everyone LOVED the result. I was OBSESSED with the look that she created. I got endless compliments on my look and people were constantly asking who the artist was. I highly recommend Lauren for any special occasions or if you just want to feel good! She definitely has a way to hype you up and make you feel gorgeous inside AND out!”Hieu, 2 years ago![](https://images.zola.com/bad28820-da91-4c83-a3d9-515605a55e44?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/lauren-m-mua)

As someone who is far from adept with hair and makeup, I was pretty much clueless with how I wanted to look on my wedding day. During my trial, Sabrina and Rachel were so patient and eager to help guide me to choose the look that felt right for me. On wedding day, Sabrina and Jenny were so timely and communicative. We had a relatively strict timeline in order to complete our wishlist of photo shots. They were so adaptable throughout the whole process and helped me manage my stress throughout the day. As for her work - Sabrina is truly an expert at her craft. Not only did she help me select a look that worked best for my features and executed it perfectly, the products she used were fantastic! After many tears, rain, and three outfit changes, hair and makeup remained flawless. Beyond their work, Sabrina and her team are some of the kindest, most genuine people I’ve had the pleasure of meeting throughout my chaotic wedding season. All it takes is one conversation with Sabrina to see her goal shine through: to make you feel your very best, and this goal was certainly achieved :).”Leizl T., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/aae451ef-be54-4970-87e0-db0e9ed501ef?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/sabrina-j-styles-photography)

Klose-Up Beauty 5.0

  * Starts at $160 
  * Serves Modesto, CA

Hello! I'm Koryn Wirth, the owner of Klose-Up Beauty. I'm a wedding and special occasion hair and makeup in California and Florida. Willing to travel for events! We offer brides the option for traditional makeup or airbrush application. All brides also receive a complimentary touch up kit for their big day .“I had such a wonderful experience with Klose Up Beauty/ Koryn for my San Francisco City Hall elopement. She did my hair and makeup, as well as my fiancé’s hair, and I was so happy to find someone who offered services for the groom too—something I didn’t see often while searching. She was incredibly fast and helpful when it came to communication, answering all my questions and putting me at ease right from the start. On the day of the wedding, she made me feel so comfortable while getting ready and was very attentive to making sure I was happy with the look. She encouraged me to speak up if I wanted anything changed, which I really appreciated—it made the experience feel very collaborative and relaxed. Since I got ready alone for the elopement, it meant a lot that she also helped me with my dress and veil. That extra bit of support made such a difference and really showed how much she cares about her clients. I couldn’t have asked for a better experience—professional, warm, and truly thoughtful. Highly recommend her to anyone eloping or getting married in the area!”Melissa S., 7 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/b51da22b-ec83-4095-b73a-3d512599f635?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/klose-up-beauty)

Hi, I’m Henna — a Bay Area bridal hairstylist passionate about creating soft, timeless styles that make you feel beautiful and completely yourself. I love being a calm, uplifting presence on your big day and bringing your hair vision to life with care, creativity, and intention. Let’s create something beautiful together! 🤍“I had the pleasure of having my hair styled by Heena as a bridesmaid in my best friend’s wedding. From the moment she arrived, she was calm, professional, and incredibly friendly—which made such a difference in the getting-ready atmosphere. She took the time to listen to what each of us wanted while also offering suggestions that really elevated the final look. I asked for a soft, romantic updo that would hold through the entire day—and she delivered perfectly. It was elegant without being overdone, and it stayed flawless from the ceremony all the way through hours of dancing at the reception. I received so many compliments, and most importantly, I felt beautiful and confident standing beside the bride. What really stood out was how efficient and organized she was while still making each of us feel pampered. She managed to style a full bridal party without anyone ever feeling rushed. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Heena to anyone looking for a wedding stylist. She truly has a gift, and I’ll absolutely be keeping her in mind for future events!”Natalia, 5 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/heenstyles)

Beauty stems from the inside and that’s where we start with our babes. We want our couples to feel like an elevated version of themselves. We are all about complimenting the mood and aesthetic of your wedding weekend while coming up with a custom look that brings it all together. With the mama wolf, Ash having over a decade of editorial and fashion experience, our work is more fashion-forward than “bridal”. Highlighting natural beauty above all. Because we work so closely with our photographers, we know how to help you feel photo ready while still feeling “approachable”. We are stoked to be considered for your beauty needs!“I hired Love Wolves Co for my hair and make up and had the best experience with them! Karen was my stylist and she did such an amazing job both for my engagement shoot and wedding day! As someone who never wears more than some mascara, she really allowed me to still feel natural and like myself while highlighting my features and ensuring my make up would photograph well. In fact, she did such a great job with make up for me and my bridesmaids that my step-mom (who typically hates getting her make up done) added that service day of! Knowing that my fine hair doesn’t hold well, I had Karen stay for a touch up right before my ceremony and couldn’t recommend that enough! Everyone loved working with her!”Anais P., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/love-wolves-co-beauty)
