Desde el primer día que fuimos a conocer las instalaciones, el señor Gary fue muy atento y respetuoso, contestó a todas nuestras dudas. Tal vez nuestro evento fue algo fuera de lo común, a diferencia de los eventos de boda que se organizan aquí, nosotros contratamos el granero para el 25 de Diciembre para celebrar los 15 años de mi hija , sabemos que son días festivos donde la gente está con su familia , más sin embargo recibimos todo su apoyo para que el evento se hiciera realidad en este día tan especial , puedo decirles que fue una experiencia maravillosa, fue en evento de ensueño y de igual manera nos hospedamos en la casa, donde realmente nos sentimos como en nuestro hogar , sinceramente todas las instalaciones estuvieron limpias en todo momento, Gary estuvo al pendiente de si necesitábamos algo y al igual si la empresa que contratamos para la planeación necesitaban apoyo. Quiero animar a todos los papás que deseen hacerle su quinceañera a su hija, que consideren contratar los servicios de Suisun Valley Inn, ya que harán que su hija viva una experiencia única y de ensueño, no se arrepentirán. Sr Gary agradezco todas sus atenciones y muy pronto estaremos trabajando con usted para los 15 años de mi otra hija… Bendiciones”Fabiola M., 22 days ago![](https://images.zola.com/0dbc73ce-706c-4f4e-8b41-7324823426c8?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/suisun-valley-inn-at-monroe-ranch)

From the moment we first reached out, the team was incredibly positive, creative, and responsive, which was so appreciated during the busy wedding planning process. On the day of, their warm, bright, and natural light-filled space with beautiful gold tones truly set the tone for our special day. They even have gold cutlery available on request (it's all in the details). Having dedicated day-of coordinators, Jennifer and Priscilla, was an absolute game changer - they were so helpful throughout the entire process, going above and beyond to ensure every detail was perfect. We couldn't have asked for a better wedding venue and highly recommend Eagle Ridge to any couple looking for an exceptional experience. Priscilla was our technical "day-of" coordinator, but both she and Jennifer had been so responsive every day leading up to the wedding, it felt like we had a coordinator every day! Btw, they did every single table setting for us the day before.

“In March 2024 our university booked a block of rooms at Shashi Hotel, Mountain View, CA. From the initial contact to the final good byes we received beyond excellent customer service! I was working with Madeleine Villanueva, Sales Manager for the hotel. Madeleine’s attention to detail, professionalism, friendliness, and assistance on every possible detail and request were outstanding. The hotel and restaurant welcomed us with customized welcome signs. The rooms were spotless clean and beds were super comfortable. Reception staff was fast to response, helpful and accommodating. The restaurant on site matched the hotel qualities. The food and the service was amazing! Overall, we had an awesome experience and looking forward to return to Shashi! I recommend both, the hotel and the restaurants to anyone visiting Bay Area.”Bogda S., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/shashi-hotel-mountain-view-an-urban-resort)

“We had such a great experience hosting our corporate team-building event for 60 people at the Los Altos History Museum! The venue is beautiful — we used both the full courtyard and the galleries, and it worked perfectly for our day. Our event had a few moving parts, including a scavenger hunt, full catering for breakfast and lunch, and even a magician/mentalist — and the space handled it all seamlessly. The amenities were super convenient too. We had a shuttle drop off team members, and those who drove had no issues finding parking. Lisa was amazing to work with. She was responsive, helpful, and incredibly accommodating — from the early setup to coordinating all the logistics. Our team had a great time, and the smooth transition between indoor and outdoor spaces made the whole experience feel effortless. We also selected Heirloom as our caterer from their approved vendor list, and the combination was smoother than I could have even dreamed! Would definitely recommend for events — both personal and corporate!”Jaysie, 6 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/2d5b63ed-4d86-4766-81c5-88fc0cb065c5?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/los-altos-history-museum)
