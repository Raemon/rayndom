## Frequently asked questions

6 Answers

Ask them a question

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically, couples book me about 13 months before their wedding date. I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible about my availability, even if you’re planning on a shorter time frame.

### Do you work with assistants or other photographers?

Sometimes, I’ll bring one assistant photographers depending on the size of your wedding. Don’t worry, this won’t cost you extra.

### Will you edit all our pictures?

Definitely. All final images will be edited for color, saturation, exposure, and sharpness to ensure they look beautiful. I also offer retouching services like blemish removal and teeth whitening for an additional charge.

### Do you also offer video services?

No, I prefer focusing on photography only, so you can get the best wedding pictures possible.

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

My turnaround time varies by season. Typically, you’ll be able to view your photos online about 4-6 weeks after your wedding. Within this time, you can also expect to receive an email with an access to the online gallery containing high-resolution image files, so you can share the photos with loved ones and order prints.

### How many pictures will we get?

We believe that such a special moment is not limited to a number. But keep in mind this estimate varies depending on your wedding package, number of guests, venue type, and other factors.
