Hi, my name is Peter and I’m the Lead Photographer and Owner of Bedrosian Studios. I specialize in a photojournalistic style of wedding photography with a touch of editorial flair. My priority is to make you feel comfortable so the day flows naturally and the moments we capture are authentic.

What sets me apart is that you always work directly with me. I’m not a big studio that sends random shooters on your wedding day. Every image on my website and Instagram is mine, so what you see is exactly what you’ll get. I combine a photojournalistic/documentary approach with just enough editorial guidance to keep things flattering without being stiff or over-posed. My focus is making couples feel comfortable so the photos look effortless and natural. At the end of the day, my job isn’t just to take pictures — it’s to tell your story in a way that feels authentic to you.

•Cybel & L.•Dec 26, 2025

Peter was amazing from start to finish. We were worried about lighting in our church, but he handled it perfectly while preserving the atmosphere. He captured our venue beautifully, kept us comfortable throughout the day, and let us truly enjoy every moment. We’re so happy with our photos—highly recommend!

  * ### From Bride: BOOK PETER NOW!

•Verified review

•Sarah W.•Dec 8, 2025

Peter was absolutely incredible! Our photos turned out beautiful and were delivered to us extremely quickly. He went above and beyond, saving the day on multiple occasions and making the entire experience stress-free. We loved his personality- he was a pleasure to work with and made everyone feel comfortable. Our wedding was in Santa Barbara, and Peter took the time to understand our vision and made sure to capture all the shots we wanted. Highly recommend him to anyone looking for a talented, reliable, and personable photographer!

  * ### Master behind the camera 

•Verified review

•Haig & M.•Nov 26, 2025

We hired Peter and his team for both photo and video, and we couldn't be happier. Our wedding was a 14-hour day with over 350 guests, and he handled everything effortlessly. His time management, calm energy, and overall vibe made us feel completely comfortable in front of the camera. Peter has an incredible eye for all the little moments—looking through our gallery truly feels like reliving the entire day. He captured everything beautifully, from the big moments to the candid in-betweens. Thank you, Peter, for caring so much about our day and giving us memories we'll cherish forever. Highly recommend Bedrosian Photo to any couple looking for someone who genuinely goes above and beyond.

•Verified review

•Anabel C.•Nov 10, 2025

Bedrosian Photo team was an absolute pleasure to work with for our wedding day. From our initial consultation, I knew I found the perfect team for our wedding, communication was quick and he asked all the right questions to understand exactly what we wanted captured. On the day of, they made me feel so special and comfortable - it felt like I was taking photos with friends instead of just another vendor. They took my crazy ideas and made them come to life, delivering amazing photos that perfectly encapsulate all the joy and love of our special day. Peter was open and honest about what would look good and took his time to make sure we got the perfect shots. He was even very patient, my daughter (6 years old) wanted to be in all the photos and he made her feel special and let her have her moment too. I would highly recommend Bedrosian Photo to anyone looking for an incredible team to capture their wedding or any other event.
