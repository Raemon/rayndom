  * ### Best Ranch Venue 

•Verified review

•Eddie •Apr 27, 2024

Connie did an awesome job with her Ranch Venue perfect space for the Vendors to setup easily. We will be waiting for the next event. Thank you Connie

  * ### A Treasured Memory 

•Verified review

•Zane D.•Feb 3, 2024

Creations built my package from beginning to end. There an all in one business which meant we didn’t have to shop for a dj or flowers or photography. The only thing we had to take care of was taste testing and our Wardrobe. Connie took care of the rest. Thank you Creations for all that you do to make those memories last.
