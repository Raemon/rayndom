I started shooting photos and video in Greece, and since moving to the US, I have dedicated myself to shooting weddings, elopements and engagements. I love being able to capture the love that my couples have for each other and the unique energy each couple has. I am always down to shoot in new locations and find the best place for my shoots!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“From our first contact with Te Dua Weddings, their communication style was quick, relatable and reassuring. The quality of their work was truly elegant, personal, elevated and storytelling. They had a calm presence throughout the day and even helped carry my dress train when I was worried about it getting dirty. It felt like the Te Dua team was there not only as a vendor, but as friends who wanted our wedding to feel personal and seamless. They really cared about us as clients rather than just getting the shot. The video was delivered fast and beautifully, capturing all the special moments of our day. We could not have asked for a better videography team to document our wedding.”Abigail V., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/3a8e72c2-ed2c-4123-a879-a00dc43feca1?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/enea-strora-photography-and-videography)

Hey, I'm Marisa! I work with couples to help capture their dream wedding day! Most days you can find me drinking coffee in front of my computer editing the day away. If I’m not home in the SF Bay Area, I’m most likely in the Sierras or at a session off the grid. Outdoor adventures light up my soul! I basically live out of a duffle bag. In my free time you can find me drinking wine with friends, maybe on a run, laying around with my dog, near a lake or finding the best tacos.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We could not imagine working with any other photographer for our wedding! From our first video meeting to touch base, to our engagement shoot, and ultimately our wedding day, Marisa collaborated with us and other vendors with so much grace and a great sense of humor. She communicates clearly and punctually. We were particularly impressed with how she was able to wrangle our large families and get group photos together with confidence, but also captured the small, intimate moments so perfectly. We will forever cherish the photos that perfectly encapsulate the best day of our lives. Thank you so much, Marisa!”Jocelyn, a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/47e0aae1-e9b4-4825-a6f0-b19b3f1c036b?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/marisa-ruth-photography)

  * Serves Pleasanton, CA

I'm Katherine, a wedding photographer based in Oakland, CA. With over a decade of experience and features in Vogue, Brides, The New York Times, and more, I know how to create wedding photos that don’t just look stunning — they feel like you. No trendy filters, no forced poses, just authentic moments that reflect who you are. I believe the best moments aren’t staged. They unfold naturally, in the quiet glances, the belly laughs, and those unspoken connections shared with your loved ones. My goal is to capture those raw, in-between moments that truly make your wedding day yours!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Holy smokes! If you're looking for a photographer in California/Bay Area who's not just talented but an absolute blast to work with, look no further. We just had our engagement shoot, and let me tell you, Katherine is the real deal. Her personality is so infectious, we forgot we were even doing a photoshoot. Before we knew it, we were laughing, being silly, and just having fun with what felt like an old friend. She asked us all the right questions that made us feel at ease and boy, did it show in the photos. TLDR? If you don't book her, you're missing out big time. I would 1000% recommend her.”Shannon P., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/36b90e59-a168-45f4-9678-5fb93dcd2a80?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/weddings-by-katherine-marchand)

My name is Thomas Seabury I am a wedding photographer of 9 years, over the past 5 years shooting just over 100 weddings per year.

I would love to be a huge part of your entire process from overall planning to execution of the day!

Thomas was so helpful with all of his direction and suggestions for the ceremony. He was able to keep his cool and roll with the punches on our very crazy day. Our Photos are absolutely stunning! I honestly can't say enough good things about him. He took so many photos and his editing is wonderful. He also did our engagement photos all the way in Yosemite. He not only drove 3 hours one way for the engagement shoot but also drove an obscene amount of hours for our wedding. He put in so much work and I can't thank him enough.”Hannah W., 2 years ago![](https://images.zola.com/364e770b-39f2-48c7-a0df-e53b64a7140c?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/twentythreeninteen)

I’m Cherlyn (rhymes with Berlin). So nice to e-meet you! If we met in person and it wasn’t during a pandemic- I would probably hug you! I’m an introvert-extrovert and tend to ramble too much when I get nervous. In emails - I tend to use exclamation points a lot!! (and will agonize over my drafts of emails before sending them because they probably have one too many!!) My aim as your photographer is to provide a memorable experience where you two feel comfortable, taken care of, and get to fully enjoy your wedding day as much as possible with all your guests & loved ones - whether they be in real life or via livestream!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Cherlyn captured our elopement in November 2024 at Timber Cove Inn. Since this was a second wedding for both of us, and was very small (just us and our kids) we wanted to keep things simple, focusing on the beauty of the landscape with a simple, sweet ceremony. Cherlyn absolutely nailed it - she captured the vibe we were going for perfectly and the photos are absolutely stunning! I could not be happier with the photos and the experience as a whole. She made us so comfortable and that led to great photos where we look at ease, which is just how we felt.”Kristin B., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/7893b11a-df00-49c4-ad9d-636b8388d7cc?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/c-wagner-photography-design-llc)

Hannah Berglund Photography 5.0

  * Photojournalistic style
  * Starts at $10,500 
  * Serves Pleasanton, CA

I'm Hannah, a full time wedding and portrait photographer in Livermore, California. To me, photography is so much more than just hiring another vendor. And that's why you should choose someone you truly love to work with! I believe the real magic happens during the in-between moments – a secret smile shared by the parents; a tearful hug with the maid of honor; a quirky moment with the best man. These memories are far more precious than any staged photo, and these are the memories I want to capture for you on your big day.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Hannah captured our day beautifully. She was really easy to work with and it was such a relief to find a photographer we were so comfortable with. I was extremely picky when it came with choosing a photographer - I searched forever before finding Hannah and felt an instant connection when we spoke. Our search stopped there as we knew she was who we wanted at our wedding! I was really nervous for the engagement session but felt instantly at ease as soon as we begin shooting. She made my fiance (at the time) and I extremely comfortable and the session was actually really fun (not that we expected it to not be fun haha.... we were both just so nervous that we were scared for how it would go!). We had numerous guests compliment us for hiring her because of how delightful she was to have at the wedding. A few of our bridesmaids actually hired her to capture their wedding after working with her! I truly can't recommend her enough - Hannah is an absolute gem!”Alex, 5 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/hannah-berglund-photography)

Follow me on Instagram *vanessamontanophotography I’m Vanessa—Bay Area born and raised, living my dream under the California sun with a camera always close by. When I’m not documenting life’s beautiful moments, I’m likely in the kitchen testing new recipes, catching up with friends over a dirty martini, cruising with country music turned up, or spending time with my family. Photography isn’t just my work—it’s something I truly love. I feel incredibly grateful to witness and capture so many meaningful stories.“We are so happy we had the opportunity to have Vanessa capture our special day!

I am an East Coast transplant wedding photographer based in the SF Bay area. I’m super laid back and kind of a goofball… I like to have fun during my photo sessions to make you feel comfortable in front of the camera!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“I can’t say enough wonderful things about Jess. We used her for not only our engagement photos & wedding but our pregnancy announcement, maternity photos with both my babies, & newborn photos. I know Zola is a wedding website so I will keep it wedding related. She’s professional & fun. She makes you feel beautiful & comfortable but also makes you feel like she’s not even there. She captures every tiny detail and is true master at finding the perfect lighting.

Hi, I’m Hayden! With over 300 weddings captured, I take a journalistic approach to photography, documenting authentic moments as they naturally unfold. I shoot with both film and digital to create timeless, heartfelt images that tell your unique love story. With a go-with-the-flow mentality, I will capture moments as they come and turn them into beautiful memories.“Words cannot explain how fantastic Hayden is! His professionalism, positive attitude, and work blew me away! He took wedding photos for me and my husband. The photographer came recommended by our wedding venue, and everything turned out perfect. Our photography package included 2 locations prior to the ceremony/reception venue. Hayden met us at our house to take photos of us getting ready. I did not prepare a list of specific photos I wanted, but Hayden was prepared. He got all the “standard” photos (getting dressed, getting hair/makeup, etc), giving me direction (which I needed as I can be awkward and camera shy). But he was also so excited to try some different shots based on the set up of our housing. We stepped outside to take first look photos… and it was cold, rainy, and windy. Hayden did not bat at eye! He was such a good sport about being in the horrible weather. Then he met us at another location to take more photos in the cold rain and wind. Finally, we made it to the venue. I loved that some photos were candidate, that I was given direction for some photos, and that I was able to bring some ideas that were executed perfectly! He was flexible and accommodating and willing to take creative photos! The photos came out amazing! I would not change a thing!”Mia G., 10 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/0879c813-a0f3-40a2-859a-7fb513f339c4?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/he-photo--2)

My name is Connie and I have been shooting weddings and portraits for over 15years. The goal for me is to give my client an heirloom of their wedding day to pass down to generations to come. As a young kid, I remember staring at my parents black and white wedding photos for a long time. It captivated me. I am very lucky to have those memories and that is what I want for my clients. I love capturing beautiful imagery through posing, beautiful light and when there isn't light, I like to create it. I can be a goof ball capturing the unexpected filled laughter. Come look at my work, and hopefully we can connect.“Connie was so awesome to work with! Leading up to the wedding she was easy to communicate with and always responded to my emails quickly. When my wedding day rolled around she was at the venue on time and got to work. She was patient with everything going on, she had an assistant as well that was great! I told Connie that I was worried about taking pictures because I never considered myself photogenic, she told me not to worry. She did a great job! The pictures turned out beautiful! I love them! Now the hard part is choosing which ones to print.”Stacey and B., 2 years ago![](https://images.zola.com/bb7b67fb-32e6-4ab5-86b0-0d09d0e9be9a?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/connie-leal-photography)

Welcome. "I BELIEVE...connection matters. Photos tell our story and carry our legacy. Melanin matters on camera. Every human deserves to be seen. 8 out of 10 humans say they feel awkward in front of the camera; Laughter is the antidote." ​ It is my loud passion to capture the personality of relationship...within couples, families, communities, and even organizations. And I have been this way since I was a kid. With my hot pink camera in tow, 8-year old me would capture the loud joy of my BIG extended family. Little did I know...they were my training ground in photography. And I am happy to say that my approach to photography hasn't changed.“Brandi was amazing to work with! We couldn’t have asked for a better photographer or a better experience! From our first virtual meeting with Brandi we knew that we made the right choice! Brandi has an amazing personality and we could tell right away that she was passionate about not only photography but about people too!! On our wedding day Brandi worked hard to bring our vision to life and exceeded all of our expectations! Our photos were amazing! We have received so many compliments on our photos! We are so thankful that Brandi was a part of our big day! I only wish that we lived closer so that Brandi could capture more of our memories!!”CaShena S., 24 days ago![](https://images.zola.com/1a8871be-c311-4f97-ae93-d0e3c5b66fc9?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/brandi-rollins-photography)

Hey, I'm Diep, the photographer at Warm Heart Photography. Based in Concord, California, I offer service around the Bay Area, and beyond. My goal is to sharpen my skills every day, serve my best, and create happy memories for my clients. Thank you for stopping by. I look forward to meeting you.“We are so happy we chose Warm Heart Photography (Diep) for both our engagement and wedding day photos. For our engagement shoot, she was incredibly friendly, responsive, and was very accommodating--even bringing a quick-change tent! She made sure to capture every shot we wanted from our shot list, and the photos turned out absolutely stunning and ethereal (exactly like we had envisioned). On our wedding day, Warm Heart Photography was equally amazing. Despite the hectic environment, Diep and her second shooter came prepared, was professional and adapted seamlessly to the ever changing environment. They worked hard to get every shot on our list, and the photos turned out beautiful and candid. (There were so many nice shots, that it was hard to choose our favorites!) They did such an amazing job with capturing everything on the day. We didn't have time to soak in everything around us, but with the photos, we were able to relive the day! Diep has a great work ethic and we wouldn't hesitate to refer her to our friends and family. We're so grateful for her talent, dedication, and kindness throughout the entire process. If you're looking for a photographer who truly cares about her clients and will do everything she can to capture your vision, Diep is the one!”Amy C., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/270a8ea8-066d-43ae-ab26-f5abab489cf3?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/warm-heart-photography)

Hi, I'm Carrie the lady behind the lens of CMG Imagery. I'm a photographer with twelve years wedding experience and a focus on natural light and storytelling. In my work, I am inspired to capture love and connection in a timeless and authentic way that will be cherished for years to come. I love creating images with movement that capture the heart and soul, the candid moments, the playfulness and personality. So get ready to adventure and let's tell your story!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Carrie is a wonderful photographer and person! We booked her to take our engagement and wedding photos and we were very happy with the results. Neither of us love getting our photo taken but she made the whole process easy and comfortable. She recommend a bunch of beautiful locations for our engagement shoot that were in our area and worked around our schedule. Our wedding photos were great (even got some with us and our dogs) and she got lots of amazing shots of our guests enjoying themselves. We highly recommend booking Carrie for your special day! Professional, efficient, and a wizard behind the lens.

At JB photography, we are storytellers and artists who believe in the power of love, connection, and creativity. Our journey began on instagram, where two passionate photographers met, bonded over our shared love for capturing life’s beauty and ultimately fell in love with both each other and the art of photography.“JB Photography did an absolutely incredible job capturing our wedding day. They took our dark and moody vision and brought it to life perfectly — every photo is breathtaking. We’re completely obsessed with how everything turned out! I’ve already recommended them to friends and family, and we won’t be using anyone else for our future photography needs.”Misty, 2 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/1c9b9437-9649-47f0-9ed4-7a0ff901fa75?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/jb-photography--4)
