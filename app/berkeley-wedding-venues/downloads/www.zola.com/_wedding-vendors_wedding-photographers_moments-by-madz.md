## About Moments By Madz

### Moments By Madz

My name is Maddie Smidebush and I'm a photographer based in Brentwood, California and I believe in capturing the beauty of love through every lens. I've been a photographer for over 7 years and shooting weddings full time for 5. I specialize in weddings, engagements and elopements with a focus on natural, candid moments that reflect the true essence of your day. While working at a wedding photography studio for the past 3 years I've been able to acquire a careers worth of experience through the shooting of over 300 weddings in that time.

What truly sets me apart as a wedding photographer is my focus on authenticity and connection. My number one goal with couples is to provide the absolute best experience through a stress-free and relaxed atmosphere. I offer free engagements shoots with every wedding package to ensure that couples feel comfortable not just in front of any camera but mine. That way come their wedding day they already have the experience of their engagement shoot to fall back on and it's a great way for me to connect with the couple ahead of time. I take the time to get to know you both as a couple so that every photo feels uniquely yours.

  * ### Engagement photo shoot 

•Verified review

•Will P.•Jul 24, 2025

Working with Maddie has been a great experience. From the moment we were connected, she has always been very responsive. Right when we got to the location, she greeted us with an enthusiastic energy and we went straight to work! My fiancé and I don’t do photo shoots, so we had no idea how to pose or anything. Maddie was able to lead us through the entire time and her easy going attitude made the overall experience fun and seamless. Our photos turned out great and she was able to do her best to accommodate the picture inspirations we had shown her. We had such a great experience with her that we’re requesting her for our wedding date!

  * ### Easy to work with wedding photographer

•Verified review

We had an excellent experience working with Maddie as our wedding photographer! She was very professional throughout the day and her calm and easy-going personality blended nicely with ours, allowing us to feel relaxed and smile naturally. She provided excellent guidance for poses and found some great spots for photos. We could not be happier with the final photos we received!

  * ### 10/10 would recommend!

•Verified review

•Michael R.•May 3, 2025

We had an amazing experience working with Maddie as our wedding photographer! She was incredibly professional, easy to work with, and made sure to capture every meaningful moment throughout our big day. During our post-ceremony photo session, Maddie’s energy was fun and upbeat. She came prepared with creative ideas and gave clear, simple directions that made posing feel natural and stress-free. While we’re still waiting to see the final photos, we already feel confident that Maddie did a fantastic job. Her attention to detail and calm presence made a huge difference, and we’re so glad she was part of our special day!
