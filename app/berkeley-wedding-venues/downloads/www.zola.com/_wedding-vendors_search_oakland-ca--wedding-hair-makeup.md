My artistry centers on creating looks that feel fresh yet timeless — elevated, understated, and softly luminous. My signature style is skin-forward, breathable, and glow-enhancing, designed to elevate your natural beauty with a polished, skin-like finish that never feels heavy or overdone. I use luxury, high-performance products chosen for comfort, longevity, and flawless wear in every light.

From the moment I reached out, Sam was incredibly approachable, knowledgeable, and friendly. The platform she works through was also nice to use as it kept communication streamlined and all in one place (especially since wedding planning can overwhelm you with emails). She took the time to understand my vision and was so patient in walking me through the process. On my wedding day, Sam and her entire team were consummate professionals. They made me and my entire bridal party feel so beautiful and radiant (we were all obsessed with the glowy bridal looks and loved how versatile everyone was). All of my bridesmaids were raving about how kind and attentive Sam was, and we were all such big fans! If I could have Sam do my makeup every single day, I absolutely would.”Kelsey C., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/7efa874d-ab4b-4cc2-9716-682385c15c6d?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/makeup-by-samantha-keefauver)

Beauty By Jasmine Yin 5.0

  * Team of 1
  * Starts at $250 
  * Serves Oakland, CA

Beauty By Jasmine Yin is an independently owned business, focusing on freelancing for makeup. If you’re looking for an artist who specializes in weddings, prom, birthdays, or everyday glam, you’ve come to the right person. Treat yourself and your bridal party to a professional makeup artist who'll ensure that you are feeling your best all night long.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“I loved working with Jasmine for my wedding hair and makeup! From start to finish, she was super professional, incredibly responsive, and a clear communicator. Her makeup looks are beautiful and I chose to go with her signature soft glam with curled hair pinned back on one side. She did a fantastic job during the trial and the day of. After the trial, Jasmine was great at asking for my feedback and incorporating it into the final look for my wedding day. She's also mindful of tailoring her approach to your specific needs to help her work last longer. Make sure to tell her about your skin type and any specific concerns, like curls falling out of your hair easily, or oily eyelids for myself which might have affected the longevity of one eye's eyeshadow. Aside from that and a couple other minor touch ups needed throughout the day (grateful for her touch up kit!), the rest of my hair and makeup stayed all night long on my wedding day. I loved my look and thought it was even better than the trial! Even though she isn't a professional hairstylist, Jasmine really nailed it with my hair. It stayed flawless all day and night, despite the dress changes and jewelry adjustments throughout the day and I received multiple compliments on my hair! She's also easy going and nice to talk to - I really enjoyed the time spent chatting with her while getting ready in the morning. It was a great, peaceful way to start the busy day. Jasmine also helped do 2 of my bridesmaid's hair and did a beautiful job. One of them said that she has a really hard time getting curls to hold, but her hairstyle lasted all night long. I'm so grateful for Jasmine's help and would recommend her to any bride looking for a talented and personable HMUA!”Jessica, 2 years ago![](https://images.zola.com/b1dba753-4cd6-4632-8ebf-1d561eb92aef?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/beauty-by-jasmine-yin)

On the first day, she created such a flawless look that lasted beautifully and made me feel so confident. The next day, I wanted something a little lighter with less layering, and she listened so patiently to my preferences and executed it perfectly. I truly appreciated how attentive she was, making sure I felt comfortable and beautiful in my own skin. Not only is she incredibly talented, but she’s also so sweet, professional, and easy to work with. I received so many compliments both days, and I can’t thank her enough for making me feel my absolute best.

Hello! I'm Koryn Wirth, the owner of Klose-Up Beauty. I'm a wedding and special occasion hair and makeup in California and Florida. Willing to travel for events! We offer brides the option for traditional makeup or airbrush application. All brides also receive a complimentary touch up kit for their big day .“I had such a wonderful experience with Klose Up Beauty/ Koryn for my San Francisco City Hall elopement. She did my hair and makeup, as well as my fiancé’s hair, and I was so happy to find someone who offered services for the groom too—something I didn’t see often while searching. She was incredibly fast and helpful when it came to communication, answering all my questions and putting me at ease right from the start. On the day of the wedding, she made me feel so comfortable while getting ready and was very attentive to making sure I was happy with the look. She encouraged me to speak up if I wanted anything changed, which I really appreciated—it made the experience feel very collaborative and relaxed. Since I got ready alone for the elopement, it meant a lot that she also helped me with my dress and veil. That extra bit of support made such a difference and really showed how much she cares about her clients. I couldn’t have asked for a better experience—professional, warm, and truly thoughtful. Highly recommend her to anyone eloping or getting married in the area!”Melissa S., 7 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/b51da22b-ec83-4095-b73a-3d512599f635?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/klose-up-beauty)

Hi, I am a henna artist in the Fremont Bay Area. ART is my passion and my passion is my profession! I use 100% organic henna made with essential oils. Henna is an ancient art in India. Henna is actually a tree mostly grown in northern part of India. In today's date, henna is loved by everyone because of its temporary dark red color and various designs whether its tattoo or arabic mehndi and many more.“My fiance and I hired Arati to do both my bridal henna as well as some henna for family members at a casual welcome dinner before our ceremonies. She was very communicative, flexible in scheduling, and did beautiful work. She also worked incredibly quickly - my family members were very impressed with how detailed of designs they had on their hands in less than 15 min each.
