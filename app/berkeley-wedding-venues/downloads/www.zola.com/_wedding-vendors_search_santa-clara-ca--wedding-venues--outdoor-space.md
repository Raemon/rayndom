![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“I would recommend Eagle Ridge to anyone over and over and over again. They set the bar so freakin’ high for what a planning team, event team and venue should be for weddings. The staff are incredible. Big shout outs to Priscilla, Jennifer, Casey, Kelly and Xochi. The process from beginning to end was enjoyable and memorable, all because of the staff. Special thanks to Jennifer, Priscilla and Casey for being so attentive and responsive to us during the planning process. The food is so GOOD!! Weddings are always hit or miss when it comes to food, but Eagle Ridge kitchen really delivered! Eagle Ridge had that vintage, warm, romantic feel that we were looking for. It was hard to envision as we were going in for meetings what it would be like on a wedding night, but the photos they gave us provided a really good example of what things COULD look like, and the venue far exceeded our expectations on the day of. The ceremony space was beautiful, and didn’t need too much to spruce it up. The venue itself is filled with many photo op worthy places for photographers and guests alike, and I love that the bar is built in. The way that Eagle Ridge is described on the Wedgewood site is 100% accurate to what it feels like on your wedding day. Everything about this day was perfect. We opted out of draping and any arbor draping for the ceremony space because we knew we had chosen a space that was just architecturally beautiful as it is. It’s not often that you can just walk into a venue and be like “yeah, it’s actually so beautiful just the way it is.” I had printed guides for how to set things up, but for the most part, I just gave high level instructions and told Kelly (our day of coordinator, who was just so incredible btw!!) that I trusted her and her team to set things up the way they felt it fit best. I left some extra decoration items as well, and said they were optional to use if they wanted to. The biggest thing I left up to her and the teams discretion was our arch. We made the floral sprays for it but didn't know what to do with the draping. Let me just say, I was so unbelievably impressed with how everything turned out. Kelly and the team that set up our wedding absolutely KILLED it!!! Everything was so beautifully set up, the arch was better than I could have done myself, the ceremony space was so beautiful, and all the signage was set up perfectly. As a Type-A personality, it felt hard to relinquish control over the small details, but the Eagle Ridge team made me feel comfortable and I didn’t think twice about it. They most certainly delivered! Our Banquet Captain Xochi also was a total boss!! She made sure the night ran smoothly and I never found myself looking for her, she was always close by if I needed her help on something. The night went off without a hitch because of Xochi and her attentiveness! I’ll say it again, yes the building and the venue itself is beautiful, but it’s the team that truly makes the experience what it is. If you want to feel taken care of, seen, heard and like you can trust people the moment you go hands off, Eagle Ridge is it. I will be replaying this day over and over and over again in my head for as long as I live, and it’s all thanks to the work that the team that helped us through it all put into it.”Nichelle P., 4 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/acc6873e-e12e-4b3a-9871-6904aa067ef3?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/eagle-ridge-by-wedgewood-weddings)

![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We recently had our wedding at Suisun Valley Inn, and overall, it was a beautiful and memorable experience. One of the biggest highlights was being able to use the venue for three full days, which gave us extra time to relax and connect with our bridal party and loved ones. That extended access truly made a difference in how special the weekend felt. However, there were a few challenges that did impact our plans. The event barn, which was a key part of our original vision, was unfortunately not finished in time for our wedding. While we understand this was out of the owner’s control, we were disappointed that we were not refunded the full 2,000 deposit, especially since the change affected nearly every aspect of our day. Additionally, when we arrived, we were surprised to find the vineyard had been plowed without any prior notice. This forced another last-minute adjustment to our setup so we wouldn’t be facing a dirt lot. It would have been really helpful to have been told about that in advance. Despite these hiccups, the venue itself has so much potential and charm, and we did have a lovely wedding. I just hope some of these experiences can help future couples plan better or spark a few improvements from the venue for the future.”Analisa R., 8 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/024bd0c3-3769-4479-be04-a31009a3418e?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/suisun-valley-inn-at-monroe-ranch)

“We hosted our October 2023 Wedding Reception at The Tech Interactive and I highly recommend it to anybody who is looking for a unique (and literally interactive) venue. It was so much fun and our guests had a great time! We rented the entire lower level and they kept the galleries and exhibits open so our guests could play with them throughout the night! They were a hit during cocktail hour as well as for taking breaks from the dance floor (although we still always had plenty of people on the dance floor!) Our event was mostly adults with a handful of younger relatives, and everyone had a great time. The exhibits at The Tech Interactive are perfect for quick and fun interactions no matter how interested (or not interested) any individual guest was in science/technology. Our engineer friends had a great time with the Cyber Detectives activities, while even our least technically-inclined guests enjoyed playing around with things like the Jet Pack Chair and Solve For Earth. This was truly best of both worlds, as we didn't have to give up any of the "traditional" wedding elements to make room for the fun of the exhibits - our tables and decorations were set up beautifully, we still had appetizers and an open bar, and like I mentioned above, there were still always plenty of people on the dance floor! We actually didn't even need to decorate as much as we might have with a more "traditional" venue either, as the existing colors, lighting, and layout of The Tech make for a strong baseline to build from. Our primary contact was Lolita and she was extremely helpful and pleasant to work with. She was there with us every step of the way, from our initial tour to our reception itself. She made sure to consider exactly what we were looking for to make our wedding special and was extremely organized and great and communicating with us as well as our other vendors. She created a great layout based on our table count, dance floor size, and the space the caterer needed, and she and her team went above and beyond and worked with our caterer and coordinator to help set everything up between the public close time and the start of our event so that everything was perfect when our guests got there. They even let us customize the exterior lighting color of the building during our event. The physical location of The Tech Interactive is fantastic as well - right in downtown San Jose within walking distance of tons of hotels and two parking garages where The Tech validates. The city closed off Market Street right in front of The Tech relatively last minute for a public city event, but Lolita was on top of it and worked with us and our shuttle company to arrange for pickup and a smooth experience for our guests. In summary: If you're looking to do something unique with your wedding or event, I can't recommend The Tech Interactive enough. Lolita was fantastic to work with and our guests couldn't stop saying how it was one of the most fun weddings they had ever been to.”Steve W., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-tech-interactive)

## About wedding venues in Santa Clara, CA

### 

California offers an incredible 840 miles of coastline, 3,000+ wineries and ancient redwoods for your wedding day. When you choose the Golden State, you're getting exceptional natural lighting for your ceremony across diverse settings from Mediterranean coastal zones to alpine mountain backdrops. Each region has its own distinctive character that can perfectly match your vision.

### What Makes California Wedding Venues So Special?

Northern California's Napa Valley welcomes you with rolling vineyards and Spanish colonial architecture where intimate wine cave ceremonies create unforgettable moments. Head to Southern California and you'll find oceanfront venues like Duke's Malibu where you can exchange vows with the Pacific stretching out behind you while enjoying fresh coastal-inspired cuisine. Palm Springs offers dramatic desert venues with mountain backdrops and striking midcentury modern architecture that photographs beautifully.

### How Much Do Wedding Venues in California Cost?

Wedding venues in California typically run between $9,600 and $11,700 which aligns nicely with the national range of $6,500-$12,000. This represents about 18% of your total wedding budget. Your overall costs will vary based on guest count:

  * 50 guests: $26,190
  * 100 guests: $43,692
  * 150 guests: $60,141
  * 200 guests: $74,836

Accessibility options have improved greatly across California venues in recent years.

### When Should You Book Your California Wedding Venue?

October leads venue inquiries in California with couples typically booking venues about 13 months (400 days) before their wedding date. If you're dreaming of a Northern California wine country wedding during peak season you'll want to book up to 18 months in advance. Southern California venues offer more flexibility especially during winter months when you can still enjoy beautiful weather while potentially securing better rates.
