Alex did an outstanding job on bringing our wedding day to life through his lens. We are so blessed to have had the opportunity to work with him and thrilled with the results. I would have him film all occasions in a heart beat! We are so grateful for you Alex and love everything you have done for us. You made the filming process during our day, so smooth and natural. No question was left unanswered. Having you there was truly a blessing. Thank you so much and please hire Alex and his team. He will capture your moment the way you have imagined it.

  * ### So happy with our results! 

•Verified review

•Mahtaab & D.•Nov 30, 2025

We found Alex on YouTube when we were searching for our elopement videographer and I’m so glad we reached out. We talked to several people but Alex’s vision, authenticity, and prices were huge selling points. He delivered everything in our contract and more, surprised us with extra footage and honestly transported us back to our magical day. He was so fun the day of as well! Making us laugh but also could be serious and connected to the intimacy of a wedding day. He also worked very well alongside our photographer and to him and his team we will forever be grateful. Reach out if you’re thinking about it! You won’t be disappointed.

  * ### The absolute BEST!

•Verified review

•Alexa•Oct 28, 2025

We got married in May of 2025 and absolutely LOVED working with Alex! From the first phone call, he was warm, passionate and transparent. He communicated well with us every step of the way and was such a wonderful presence on the wedding day. He and his team worked well together and so well with our photographer and other vendors. He did an incredible job of capturing the day as we experienced it! Cannot recommend Alex and his team enough!

  * ### Thoughtful, detailed, professional! 

•Verified review

•Courtney•Oct 16, 2025

I found them through my friend's wedding video. I was impressed by their work. Alex was always friendly and clear with communication. In the hustle and bustle of wedding planning where some vendors can stress you out, I never had a single problem with Alex. There was an ease of mind that he had everything under control, and the video proved it. We cried at our video! He really captured every moment and detail of our bid day! Thank you again!

## Frequently asked questions

15 Answers

Ask them a question

### Do you film destination weddings?

Definitely! While we’re based in Southern California, we’re available for destination weddings worldwide. If your wedding is outside of our complimentary area, we’re happy to come to your city/country for an additional fee to cover the cost of travel and reasonable accommodations.

### Do you film elopements?

Absolutely, we adore them! Reach out anytime to ask about our special pricing for elopements! Please note your elopement must have fewer than 20 total guests.

### Do you have insurance?

Yes! We’re happy to send a copy of our certificate of liability insurance to your venue or any other vendors upon request.

### Who will edit our wedding video?

All footage we film is edited in-house by our incredible editing team.

### Can you do a same-day edit?

We do not do same-day edits, but do offer expedited edits for an additional fee! Our typical turnaround time is 2-3 months, but a rush edit would guarantee your film to be completed within 2-3 weeks from your event date.

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Once you know your wedding date, we recommend reaching out as soon as possible about our availability. Our calendar updates often, so we'll let you know if we have your date available! We do not double-book dates.

### What is a Cinematic Event Film?

A Cinematic Event Film is a film that you’ll watch time and time again! Its a video that takes all of the key, special moments throughout your day and condenses them into a beautifully edited shortened film. To see examples of our videos, please head over to the ‘Films’ tab on our website!

### Do you offer Documentary-Style long films?

Yes, we have this available as an Extra called the Feature Length Film! All of our packages include the Cinematic Event Film (highlight film), so if you were to add on the Feature Length Film, you would receive both of those videos!

### Do you offer drone footage?

Yes, all of our packages include drone footage, complimentary! As long as your venue/location & the weather allow it to be flown, we’ll include it in your film!

### What is your approach to shooting videos?

We are all about capturing organic, real moments with minimal posing. Typically the only time we’ll intervene is if we give you small pointers like “whisper something sweet to each other!” to get your smiles shining! We love filming all of the special moments without them being forced because we want you to remember what truly happened at your wedding, not some made-up version!

### What does the booking process look like?

To secure your date on our calendar, we will collect a $1,000.00 retainer. The retainer is deducted from the total price of your package, and the remaining balance isn't collected until the day before your wedding!

### Our ceremony and reception are in two different locations. Will you be able to film both of them?

Yes, we’ll go to as many locations needed! Our packages run on consecutive hours, so as long as there is enough time for us to film/travel between locations we’re good to go!

### Do you offer military and first responder discounts?

Yes, all active/veteran military and first responders are eligible to receive 5% off the cost of their packages, just let us know when you inquire. Thank you for your service!

### Do you do photography?

We do not offer photography services, but we do have some great recommendations! Just fill out a contact form and we would be happy to refer you to some photographers.

### Do you offer Super 8 film videography?

Yes, we love vintage film! We have Super 8 Videography Packages that can be added onto any of our base videography packages.
