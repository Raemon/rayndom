  * ### Incredible Day

•Verified review

•Linzey R.•May 29, 2025

We got married at Fairview Valley of the Moon, and it was everything we dreamed of and more. It truly was the best day of our lives. From the moment we booked, the team made us feel supported and excited. Alex and Vanessa, our incredible wedding coordinators, went above and beyond. They were so responsive, attentive, and kind—every question was answered, every detail was handled. We felt completely taken care of, which made all the difference. The venue itself is stunning, and the day flowed so smoothly. The florals were breathtaking, the food was a huge hit with our guests, and they coordinated effortlessly with all of our vendors. They took care of the set-up, breakdown, and all the in-between moments with so much care and professionalism. And the reception? The music was amazing, and the dance floor was packed all night long—right up until the very end! The energy was incredible, and we had the time of our lives. We’re so thankful to Fairview Valley of the Moon for making our wedding day absolutely unforgettable. If you’re looking for a beautiful venue with an incredible team that genuinely cares, this is the place.

We are so happy that we chose Fairview Valley of the Moon! Having Evelyn as our wedding coordinator made planning the ceremony and reception a breeze. She prepared us for every single detail we should expect on our Big day and went above and beyond to make sure everything was to our liking.
