I'm a fine art wedding photographer based in Northern California and beyond. After discovering my love for photography, I always knew I wanted to become a full time wedding photographer. I am so fortunate to call this my job for over five years! My photography work often describe as romantic, soft, bright and natural that lend itself from my love of film look and fine art. When I'm not behind the camera or editing the latest wedding, you can find me spending time with my wife and our two Tabbies. I would absolutely love to get to know you and be your photographer!

  * ### One of our most favorite vendors!!

•Verified review

•Diana•Aug 27, 2025

Ditto is an absolute dream to work with and I am so happy we went with him as our wedding photographer. My husband and I are awkward and stiff in front of cameras, but Ditto made us feel right at ease. He gave us gentle guidance with poses, helped us relax, and chose some of the most beautiful spots for photos. We adored our engagement photos but our shots from our wedding absolutely stunned us - we could not believe how gorgeous everything turned out! If you're looking for a photographer who is professional, easy to work with, quick with their edits and final photos, you have to go with Ditto. Thank you so much for capturing our best moments, and we can't wait to work with you again soon.

  * ### Amazing Photographer!

•Verified review

•Mariah O.•Aug 13, 2024

Ditto and his assistant showed up early and started taking amazing photos right off the bat. The pre-wedding communication was timely. He was easy to work with and brought calm energy to a day when stress can permeate the fun out of it. We immediately received a high volume, beautiful sneak peak the evening after the wedding which was a fun surprise and a great way to start our honeymoon admiring the gorgeous photos. If you are considering Ditto Diante Photography for your wedding, I would highly recommend him.

I can't recommend Ditto enough. He is professional, friendly, easy to work with, and cares so much about his clients. Not to mention he takes amazingly beautiful photos! Ditto is so talented and will go far in the wedding industry, I'm sure!

## Frequently asked questions

18 Answers

Ask them a question

### Do you have insurance?

Yes, and I am happy to provide a certificate of insurance to your venue upon request.

### Do you shoot with assistants or other photographers?

Sometimes, depending on the package and your size of wedding.

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

Next day for the preview. Typically, you’ll be able to view the complete gallery online about 4-6 weeks after your wedding.

### How many pictures will we get?

You can expect about 800 to 1000 images per wedding. But keep in mind this estimate varies depending on your wedding package, number of guests, venue type, and other factors.

### Do you also offer video services?

No, but I can recommend you to multiple excellent videographers.

### Will you edit all our delivered pictures?

Definitely. All final images will be edited for color, saturation, exposure, and sharpness to ensure they look beautiful. I also offer retouching services like blemish removal and teeth whitening for an additional charge.

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically, couples book me between 6-12 months before their wedding date. I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible about my availability, even if you’re planning on a shorter time frame.

### Do you take engagement photos?

Absolutely! In fact, an engagement session is one of the biggest recommendations we want you to consider when hiring your wedding photographer. Besides getting killer images of the two of you, this is the time to start building the relationship with your photographer.

### How many weddings a year do you take?

I do no more than 30 weddings a year. I prefer to provide exceptional service and a personal experience for each wedding couple, which means I choose not to accept multiple back-to-back weddings per weekend. By doing this, I am not limiting myself, rather I am allowing me to fully commit to each and every client.

### What’s a “first look” and do I need one?

A first look is simply a choice to see each other before the ceremony, and have the flexibility and freedom to take all of your wedding party and/or family photos ahead of time.We highly encourage a first look if your ceremony and reception are taking place at the same venue. This will allow you more time for your important photos, and to enjoy your cocktail hour with your guests.

### Who is your second photographer?

I work with several professional independent photographers that I vetted personally to shoot in a consistent manner.

### What kind of camera gear do you use?

I use several professional digital and film cameras (Contax 645, Fujifilm GFX 50S, XH-1, X-Pro2). A range of professional lenses, and other lighting equipment

### What is Digital Download means?

I deliver the photos to you via online gallery where you can directly download all the pictures to your computer hard drive in different resolutions (social media, hi-res, original)

### Do you travel?

Yes I do! No extra travel fee for weddings inside travel area (San Francisco Bay Area)

### How do I book my date? What is the payment schedule?

I require a signed contract and 25% retainer to secure your date. All of this is done conveniently online, where you are able to access all of your pertinent wedding information right at your fingertips. I accept credit cards. Your balance must be paid one month before the wedding date.

### Do we have to buy prints through you?

Nope. You will have a license for personal use and reproduction written into your agreement.

### What is the next step?

We can schedule a consultation, FaceTime or over a phone call to talk about more of your wedding visions. Once you decide to book, I will send you my Wedding Photography Agreement and an invoice for the deposit. Once I receive those two things, I will hold your date!

### What happens if you can’t make it to the wedding?

It would take a pretty grave situation for me to miss your wedding. If for some horrible reason I was unable to be there, I will secure a replacement photographer with similar artistic style. If a replacement photographer can not be found, I will give a full refund
