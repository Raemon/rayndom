With a passion for design and 11+ years of experience, Terri is able to curate an event that matches your design aesthetic, keep things on track, and make the planning process as easy as possible so you can focus on enjoying every moment of your big day.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“I contacted Terri, at TMF, to discuss my daughter’s upcoming bridal shower and she was amazing! I had a few ideas of what I was looking for and she understood what I was imagining and really refined what I was thinking and converted my few thoughts into a cohesive theme and a beautiful event for my daughter! The bridal shower was beautiful! The decor, theme, drinks, food, tables and chairs, decorations, umbrellas… and so many details… all came together so beautifully. It was quite impressive to see the event space transformed into my daughter’s dream shower! Because Terri is so creative, organized, resourceful and is a great communicator, I was able to host my daughter’s bridal shower and actually participate and enjoy this once-in-a-lifetime moment stress free. I highly recommend contacting Terri/TMF to anybody who wants a true professional to create an amazing event guests will really love and you can be proud to host.”Annamaria P., 10 days ago![](https://images.zola.com/34379bff-91b3-4980-a6f9-bcce0b50df51?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/tmf-events)

For over 20 years, I have succeeded in helping couples, individuals, corporations and organizations plan their ultimate party or celebration. I offer partial planning, full planning and day of management services. With an extensive and diverse background in the hospitality industry, I have a thorough understanding of the market and all the nuances needed to champion a client’s every need. Whether throwing a bridal shower, wedding, facilitating a yearly team fundraiser or a community event - I can help you price and locate vendors and entertainment, negotiate deals, choose themes and decorations, provide onsite event management and more.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Tyler has a lot of experience in the wedding industry and it shows! From the beginning she made it clear what the timeline would look like for our partnership - what would be needed and when. When I became a little overwhelmed half-way through planning, Tyler was able to pick up additional scope of work which was a huge relief at the time. She also saved me a huge headache by picking up and dropping off some of my rental items since the minimum order spend for delivery was more than double my rental quote (my wedding was in a pretty remote area so most companies charged a high fee for delivery). Tyler was very thoughtful and organized about the little details I didn't think of which showcases her high degree of experience and attention to detail. She wasn't afraid to push on things on behalf of myself and my husband with our wedding venue - which I really appreciated! We had great communication throughout the wedding planning process - centralizing information in a shared Google doc. Tyler was willing to review my own personal wedding planning documents as well. She was always quick to respond to emails or texts, and also let me know in advance if she was going to be delayed in responding. On the day-of, Tyler had a great demeanor - when I saw her I could tell she was getting down to business but she made sure to keep things calm and light with me - making sure I felt comfy and relaxed on my wedding day. She kept things moving in the wedding day so we kept pace with the timeline. She made sure to account for all the logistical things like where to store decor items before and after the event. She was fantastic at corralling all the wedding vendors, collecting all the documents and information and knew when to keep me in/out of the loop at all times. Overall I would highly suggest working with Tyler for her high degree of experience, organization, thoughtfulness, and overall pleasant demeanor.”Emily, 4 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/de555fce-034c-40e0-a14e-cca17b45fdd4?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/events-by-tyler)

Casey's Curated Events 5.0 Los Angeles, CA

With over 10 years of experience in the event planning industry, I specialize in transforming visions into seamless, memorable experiences. As a dedicated perfectionist who thrives under pressure, my focus is always on the small details that make an event extraordinary. I began planning everything from intimate birthdays and gender reveals to elaborate engagement parties and baby showers. Since officially stepping into the wedding business in 2021, I have navigated and managed every challenge the industry presents, ensuring a stress-free process for my clients.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Casey’s Curated Events made planning our destination wedding an absolute breeze. Casey was there every step of the way with incredible energy, organization, communication and above all dedication. From the beginning, Casey took the time to truly understand my vision and explained the planning process in a clear, easy to understand way which was especially helpful while planning a destination wedding on a short five month timeline. I felt supported and informed throughout the entire process. I gave Casey full creative freedom with our invitations, and she completely delivered! Her creativity and attention to detail set the tone for our wedding from the start. She was also incredibly responsive, making herself available via email, text, and phone, and handled communication between the travel agency, resort coordinator, and vendors seamlessly. As the wedding approached and decisions felt overwhelming, Casey always reassured me and helped narrow down options, making everything feel manageable. From creating a comprehensive packing list (down to things like bobby pins!) to personally making sure we didn’t have to worry about the little details, Casey thought of everything. When we arrived at the resort, she took the time to walk the property with us — showing us the ceremony and reception spaces, photo locations, rehearsal and helping us visualize the full experience. She also joined us in meeting the on-site coordinator and ensured everyone was aligned. Her ability to advocate for us, ask the right questions, and clarify details made such a difference, especially since most communication with the resort had taken place via email. On our wedding day, Casey was truly amazing. She coordinated everything behind the scenes, kept everyone on schedule, and solved problems before we even knew they existed. Her calm presence, care, and positive energy allowed me to fully enjoy every moment of our wedding. Thank you, Casey, for going above and beyond. Having you as our wedding planner was truly a blessing.”Silvia D., a month ago![](https://images.zola.com/5b1c0fb0-aea9-426f-9a40-1bf23b278a07?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/casey-s-curated-events)

Thanks for visiting Breezy Day, we are so happy you are here! We are a sister team in San Diego, committed to helping you make your engagement & wedding day a breeze! WE CANNOT WAIT TO GET TO KNOW YOU!“We couldn’t be more grateful for Courtney and her sister Heather at Breezy Day Weddings! Courtney was our coordinator and Heather did our florals, and together this duo worked absolute wonders. They not only brought our dream wedding vision to life exactly as we planned, but also gave us the priceless gift of being able to truly relax and be present with our family and friends. We were initially skeptical about hiring a coordinator, but trust us, this should be the very first priority when planning your wedding.

Everything flowed perfectly, and it was stress-free for us.

Kaci Danae Events 5.0 San Jose, CA

  * Offers 3 services
  * Starts at $500 
  * Serves California

I’ve always been inspired by the strong, ambitious women in my life who built successful small businesses in the hospitality industry — from restaurant owners and bakers to caterers and florists. Growing up surrounded by their entrepreneurial spirit, I was motivated to follow my own path and create something meaningful in the world of events. ​ After spending two years working as a Wedding Coordinator at the Westin, the pandemic hit and forced a pause on hotel weddings. That unexpected turn of events only fueled my determination to turn my passion into a full-time business. And so, Kaci Danae Events was born.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Kaci was truly the best day of coordinator we could have asked for! She was responsive from the very beginning and after meeting for the intro call, I knew she would be the best person to trust for all the details on our wedding day. We put our trust and confidence in her and she came through executing our vision to be better than we could have imagined. She respected all of our non-traditional wedding plans and never tried to convince us to do something else which we really appreciated. She allowed us to enjoy the week leading up to our wedding day knowing I didn't have to answer any last minute vendor questions, she calmed my nerves on our day, and she knew exactly how to handle my crazy family and friends to allow everyone to have an amazing day with us. Thank you so much Kaci for making our dream wedding come true!”Diana & J., 3 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/kaci-danae-events)

McKenna is the most kind, helpful, and enthusiastic person to assist you during such an important time in your life. She made sure everything went perfectly on our wedding day and every day leading up to it! When we first started our wedding planning journey, we only knew where we wanted to have it, and due to the venue location not regularly being used for weddings, we needed to outsource vendors for everything. That's where McKenna came in and helped us out by hand-picking every vendor that she knew would provide the exact things we were looking for. From catering, florals, furniture rentals, DJ, and all the little details, she knew who would be perfect for the job and she was right about every single one! Every time we had a question or a crazy idea, she had an answer right away and she would do everything she could to make it happen. One thing that we were really hoping for was getting a disco ball above our dance floor, but since we were outdoors, it wasn’t looking promising. McKenna was the one who made sure that we got our disco ball, and it was absolutely perfect! That’s just one example of the many ways McKenna ensured our dream wedding would become a reality. On the day of, McKenna and her team were so efficient and handled everything so that my husband and I could relax and focus on ourselves. We got to our venue and everything was already done and ready to start the day! McKenna was amazing at time management throughout the day, and she was so helpful to not only us, but our families, wedding party and guests as well. Everything went perfectly on schedule and all the crazy ideas that we had came to life with no issues! It was truly the best day of our lives and it wouldn’t have been possible without McKenna’s help!

Hi! My name is Tiffany Rivers, owner of Rivers Event Planning. I have been in the hospitality industry for 15 years. My journey started in culinary school as a young adult and then as an Event Banquet Captain for various catering companies on the Central Coast. My love for serving others lead me to receive a degree in Hospitality Management!

We selected her Day-Of Coordination package and it was one of the best decisions we made for our wedding. We were married at the Madonna Inn with 140 guests. I was a very detail-oriented bride with a very specific vision for our event, and Tiffany made it all happen so seamlessly. Throughout the process Tiffany was there to offer support and ease any anxiety I had about the planning. On the day of the wedding, we didn’t have to worry about a single thing. She executed our vision flawlessly, and we were able to be fully present for the whole day. I would work with Tiffany for any event I plan in the future.”Felicia C., 8 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/bdf6c823-f7b9-41aa-a2f4-ec205405c309?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/rivers-event-planning)

She made the meetings fun and something I genuinely looked forward to — thanks to her, I felt excited about the wedding rather than stressed! When she knew she would be unavailable during trip that overlapped with her scheduled service start time, she proactively started her services early to make sure everything was covered — such an incredible level of professionalism and care. Lily made the entire planning process feel seamless and joyful. Her energy, organization, and support on the wedding day were unmatched, and I truly couldn’t have imagined a better coordinator. She made everything feel effortless, fun, and memorable, and we are so grateful for her! Can't recommend her enough!!!”Joy T., 2 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/a1dd1b8e-007e-4275-84ac-9be721173799?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/slay-events)

She made my vision come to life and allowed me to actually ENJOY the day, because she held everything together so seamlessly. From our very first meeting, Carissa showed incredible professionalism — she is organized, always ahead of schedule, and a true trooper who constantly reminded me that I was in good hands and that everything would turn out beautifully. Throughout the planning process, Carissa was there every step of the way: from designing the vibe, brainstorming stationery ideas, narrowing down floral options, and helping with venue and vendor selection, to managing the actual flow of the wedding. You think you know what you want — until you’re faced with ten different options and endless Pinterest posts! Carissa was my calm guide in those moments. She patiently walked me through decisions, helped me focus on what mattered most, and gave thoughtful, supportive advice while always respecting my final choice. One of the things I appreciated most was how she reminded us that this was OUR day, and that we should experience it fully. She built the itinerary to include intentional moments of privacy, so we could process everything and make lasting memories together. On the wedding day itself, Carissa and her assistant Helena were with us every moment — directing us where to go and what to do so we didn’t have to think about logistics. She even prepared little cards for our wedding party with key times and tasks, so everyone knew exactly what to expect. When last-minute needs came up (as they always do), Carissa was like a fairy godmother — somehow making everything appear and solving problems before we even had the chance to stress. Overall, Carissa is THE wedding planner if you want your dream wedding. She doesn’t just help you execute your vision — she helps you build it, piece by piece, with incredible care and expertise. Her network of vendors is also fantastic, which saved us so much time and stress. Thanks to her, we ended up with an incredible team, including a handroll ice cream cart that was such a hit! If you want a planner who is professional, organized, supportive, and truly dedicated to giving you the best day of your life — Carissa is the one.”Amy Y., 4 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/de756d09-d8fa-4d78-9324-1e023eaa33c8?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/positively-charming-weddings)

Hi! I am Clemence the face behind The Perfect Pair Wedding :) I am born & raised in France, in the city of love Paris. During college I got the chance to do a semester abroad in San Diego, and met this really special, handsome, American guy... You see it coming? YES! After 3 years of long distance relationship, I finally married the love of my life. A little bit about The Perfect Pair Wedding... it is a San Diego based Wedding planning company, we plan & design weddings all over Southern California to bring to life our Perfect Pair's dreams.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“When we first connected with Clemence, we were feeling overwhelmed and anxious. With our wedding less than six months away and having recently parted ways with our original planner, we were in urgent need of someone who could bring our dream wedding to life. Clemence stepped in with infectious enthusiasm, and from the outset, it was clear she genuinely cared about realizing the vision we held for our special day. An early experience that solidified our confidence in Clemence, and one we will always cherish, was our engagement photoshoot. Just a week after our initial meeting, Clemence learned of our upcoming anniversary trip to the Loire Valley, where we planned to stay at a Chateau and have our engagement photos taken. The photographer we had initially found was unresponsive, creating a stressful situation. Clemence immediately took charge, connecting us with an amazing Parisian photographer she had collaborated with previously, Lea Everin. Within a couple of days, she had arranged a two-hour photoshoot for us at the Chateau. This swift action and dedication left us speechless and demonstrated a level of commitment that truly made the entire experience unforgettable. Clemence excelled in understanding and aligning with our expectations, particularly regarding organization. She effectively utilized a shared spreadsheet to keep us synchronized on tasks and, crucially, the budget. Her proficiency with Canva was also a great asset, allowing her to create clear visual representations for elements like table settings and decor, which was immensely helpful. During our meetings, Clemence had a remarkable ability to make us feel as though our wedding was her sole focus. She also introduced us to an outstanding team of vendors, including the talented photographer Renata Amazonas and Katlyn Jernigan from Toast Catering, all of whom contributed significantly to our day. What truly set Clemence apart was her receptiveness to feedback and her proactive approach. We had several productive meetings at the venue, which fostered a sense of calm and shared understanding, ensuring our wedding would be everything we envisioned. She also skillfully managed the planning process itself, making it feel like a unique and enjoyable experience in its own right. We'll never forget how she coordinated with cake vendors; after we expressed our desire for a fun and memorable tasting, she arranged a delightful experience at the venue with Connor’s Cakes, complete with delicious samples and champagne. Given the exceptional service leading up to the wedding, it's hard to imagine Clemence could have surpassed our expectations on the actual day – yet she did. Our wedding day proceeded flawlessly. Despite concerns about potential rain leading into the weekend, Clemence had worked diligently with us to prepare for all scenarios. Thankfully, the weather was beautiful, and we had the most perfect wedding we could have ever asked for. Throughout the entire day, we were completely free of worry, allowing us to fully immerse ourselves in and savor every precious moment. Thank you, Clemence, for truly making our entire wedding journey and the day itself absolutely perfect. We will cherish these memories forever.”Carlos T., 9 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/84ec3253-0d67-41a8-b062-d233e47e612c?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/the-perfect-pair-wedding)

Hi, I’m Morgan! Thank you so much for being here. I am the Owner and Lead Planner of MBK Events. Let’s get straight to it - I freaking love love and I love planning. I swear, celebrating love, planning events, and getting to meet new people is my specialty. While planning my own wedding, I realized that so many Brides are not enjoying the process - so, that's where I plan to step in! I officially launched my business in October of 2021 so I can help other brides execute, plan, style and enjoy the wedding planning process. It is the most magical time of your life so lets make sure it feels magical all the way to the big day!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“MBK Events was truly the heartbeat behind our wedding day. From the very beginning, Morgan kept us calm, confident and organized through every step of the planning process. She coordinated with our vendors flawlessly, ensured our timeline ran perfectly, and handled every little detail with so much care and precision, like it was her own wedding! On the day of the wedding, she was everywhere we needed her to be—quietly making sure everything went smoothly so we could simply be present and enjoy the moment with our friends and family. She came into the bridal suite and checked with me to make sure I was ok or if I needed anything. She made sure the groomsmen were on schedule and focused on what they needed to do. The rental company didn’t bring the right items and even forgot silverware and instead of bothering me with it or making me try to figure it out in the midst of photos, she handled it and made sure everything to delivered (That situation alone should make you want to hire her)! Through every aspect of the planning process, I knew Morgan had everything covered. She listened intently to our wishes and executed them perfectly! We are endlessly grateful for Morgan and the MBK team. Their professionalism, warmth, and genuine passion for what they do made our day unforgettable. They went above and beyond in every way, and we can’t imagine our wedding without them. If you’re looking for a planner who will treat your day with as much love and attention as you do, Morgan is the one! You will not regret hiring her!”Ally, 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/d78a6843-a9f7-4c49-be5f-f8368c20c0e3?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/mbk-events)

I’m Ashley, the owner of Rose Event Co. I love being able to share in the love of two individuals and feel lucky to get to work with such wonderful people each day! I’ve been planning weddings and events for over eight years now, and I couldn’t be more thankful with where I am now in my business. I primarily serve the OR | WA | CA markets, but will travel anywhere!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Hiring Ashley at Rose Event Co as our Day of Wedding Coordinator was definitely one of the best decisions we made in planning our wedding. I thought I was going to be able to manage planning our entire wedding myself, but as the day crept closer and closer, I realized that I was definitely going to need a hand. We spoke with a dozen different coordinators, and Ashley just stood out SO strongly amongst the rest. To put it as simply as possible, she saw our vision, she understood it, she stood in and shared in it with us. She knew exactly how to support us in making it happen, and she was easily able to make us feel that. We initially had concerns about her being located so far away from us (we're in Oakland, CA), but she put those concerns to rest so quickly! Throughout my months of planning after hiring Ashley, she was always there to answer my questions, and provide support and reassurance in all of the little things that I just wasn't sure how to handle myself, and she did so with such grace, patience, and an air of calm that was so extremely helpful and reassuring. When the month of our wedding arrived, Ashley quickly got to work on communicating with and organizing all of our vendors and laying out the structure for the day. She traveled to Monte Rio to be with us the day before our big day, walked us through the ceremony, went over all of the details, and left us so confident and comfortable in her extremely capable hands. The day of the wedding, Ashley handled EVERYTHING and EVERYONE with such care and tranquility. All of our wedding vendors absolutely loved her, and we never stopped hearing about how great she was to work with! Ashley is an absolute BOSS in all of the best ways that you can imagine! She is supportive, encouraging, communicative, active, helpful, caring, the list just goes on and on. She wants you to succeed, and you can FEEL it. She remembered and double checked on all of the little details, before, during, and after our wedding, and words simply cannot express our gratitude. She did so many things automatically, that I hadn't even thought to discuss with her, but was so grateful that we had her there to do. Thank you Ashley!! She did so many little things that I didn't even realize until I started looking through all of our photos, and noticed that they had all been done. On top of all of that, she basically packed up the entirety of our decor with the assistance of her extremely helpful husband, which was such a huge relief for us and for our wedding party who had put so much into the day. We were all able to completely disconnect and just enjoy the evening, which was so unbelievably priceless. There are so many things that make Ashley stand out from other coordinators. So many coordinators that we had talked to before Ashley had a big list of things that they would NOT do, but not Ashley. She was willing to do whatever needed to be done to ensure that our wedding day went perfectly, and it did, thanks to her!! HUGE bonus, she brought along her Super 8 camera, and we CANNOT WAIT to see the footage!! If you're looking for someone who has your back, and can handle ALL of the things with a level of calm that oozes into everyone around her, HIRE ASHLEY! You absolutely will not regret it. Thank you so much Ashley, for EVERYTHING that you did, and for ALL of your help in making our wedding day so unbelievably perfect!!”Rachael S., 5 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/45c2f77a-1304-4eaa-b61e-2989dc111d06?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/rose-event-company)

Afterall, it is YOUR day :) With an emphasis on creative and sentimental design, we transform your one of a kind love story into a unique lasting impression.

I’ve never seen anything like this before!” At CJC that’s the vibe we are all about!!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“There are not enough words in the English dictionary to describe how wonderful Joey is. Not only is she the kindest woman you will ever meet, but you will never feel like "just another client" when you're with her. She listens to your individuality and embraces your ideas to create your own one-of-a-kind dream wedding. She takes the time and works hard in every single aspect of her craft -- it truly is amazing to have an artist that took the time to wrap 200 twinkle light strands with over 50 6 ft. fall leaf garlands and tie them up on the ceiling, all because I (the bride) wanted to feel like I was in an autumn rustic, twinkle light heaven. Hiring her is the best thing we did for our wedding. Not only did we have the wedding of our dreams, but we walked away with a lifelong friend. To hire Joey is to know your wedding or event will go off without a hitch. Trust me, just look at these photos!”Alyssandra D., 2 years ago![](https://images.zola.com/1c163d20-e136-424e-b456-0398e7813530?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/chasing-joy-creations)
