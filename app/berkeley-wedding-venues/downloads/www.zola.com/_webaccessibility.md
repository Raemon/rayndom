# Website Accessibility for Couples, Guests and Other Visitors with Disabilities

* * *

We at Zola are committed to making our website usable for all of our couples, guests and other visitors to our website, including persons with various types of disabilities, by meeting or exceeding the requirements of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (“WCAG”) Version 2.0 Level AA.

We are currently in the process of updating our website and are designing our updated website with the needs of persons with disabilities specifically in mind. We have engaged an experienced accessibility consultant, Allyant, to conduct a website accessibility audit and provide recommendations to increase accessibility so that our website and mobile site meet or exceed applicable standards.

In addition, persons with disabilities who have any difficulty navigating or using our website may call us at [1-408-657-ZOLA](tel:+1-408-657-9652) and speak with a representative who will provide any and all information that is available on our website, assist with setting up or reviewing wedding registries, wedding websites and/or guest lists, and generally provide whatever assistance is necessary or helpful to provide all of the functionality otherwise offered to our couples, guests and other visitors through our website.
