  * ### Great Event Partner!

•Verified review

•Tony Caters•Aug 28, 2023

As a vendor, we love working at Club Auto Sport. Its unique theme and combination of indoor space and large outdoor patio make it easy to create different vignettes, especially when there is a cocktail hour that needs its own space. The venue is home to a collection of classic exotic cars and tons of racing memorabilia, lovingly displayed. The owners take such good care of the venue, and strive to provide a great experience from start to finish. Club Auto Sport is truly a great partner!

### WHAT IS THE GUESTS CAPACITY FOR EACH VENUE SPACE?

Museum – 123 persons Parkade – 200 persons Patio – 93 persons Extended Patio – 60 persons Note: Capacity may vary depending on your choice of seating styles, stage size, dance floor, and décor.

### CAN I DECORATE THE VENUE?

YES. Please contact our Event Specialist for details, suggestions and restrictions. Many Event Planners have creatively added to the existing decors of our venues in the last 14 years, but it is not necessary to enhance the venue other than tables, chairs, displays, and centerpieces. All final decorating designs need to be approved 15 days prior to your event. Our Event Specialists are happy to work with you on ideas and inspiration.

### WHAT IS PROHIBITED FROM THE VENUE?

PROHIBITED DÉCOR ITEMS: o Nothing can be attached to any hardscape or walls o Open Flames o Helium Balloons o Balloon Drops o Streamers and Silly String o Rice, Bird Seed, Confetti and Glitter

### HOW MUCH TIME DO I HAVE TO DECORATE?

You have 1 ½ hours prior to the event. Additional set-up time can be purchased by the ½ hour.

### CAN WE HAVE CANDLES?

Only LED battery-operated candles or Aqua lights are permitted. With the exception of a candle-lighting ceremony in front of the fireplace or a water feature on the Patio.

### CAN WE HAVE BUBBLES?

Yes, outside in the Patio or Extended Patio only. No bubbles are permitted inside.

### WE NOTICE THE MUSEUM HAS LOTS OF SMALL ITEMS, AND THE PARKADE HAS MANY BEAUTIFUL CARS ON DISPLAY. ARE CHILDREN ALLOWED?

Yes. Club Auto Sport has many personal and historical items on display; therefore, we do need to enforce that all children are accompanied by an adult at all times. We do have a strict “No Touching” rule.

### DO WE NEED MICROPHONES?

Patio & Museum – The patio is a quaint area, but if the speaker is soft-spoken, it is recommended that a microphone is used. For your convenience, we do have an in-house system with a wireless microphone or headset for use. Parkade – The Parkade is a spacious room and a microphone is recommended for all toasts and speeches.

### CAN WE HAVE LIVE MUSIC?

Yes, you can have a band or DJ. They will need to be “self-contained” with their own speakers, soundboard, PA rack, microphones, extension cords, power strips, and gaffers’ tape. For the safety of your guests, all electrical cords must be taped to the floor with gaffer tape. Our venue has a house speaker system for rent that is compatible with phones, tablets, and laptops which is perfect for background music for events.

### WHO OPEERATES THE MUSIC?

We recommend that your event or wedding manager coordinates the flow of the music, or, if you wish, we can hire an additional staff member to handle this for you (at an additional charge).

### THERE ARE MANY LCD PANELS AROUND THE VENUE; CAN WE USE THEM FOR A PHOTO MONTAGE?

Yes, that is one of the many benefits of having your event at Club Auto Sport. The displays can be used to show photos, slides, or videos. We allow one device input to be displayed on the screens. You will need to provide the PC/MAC or USB. Once the display is showing, our staff cannot change it.

### CAN WE BRING OUR OWN LIQUOR AND SERVE IT TO OUR GUESTS?

NO. Outside alcohol is not allowed at Club Auto Sport. Please note: that this also includes party favors (i.e., mini champagne bottles, bottles of wine, etc. may not be given away as party favors). All alcohol must be contracted with an outside licensed Caterer or Bar Service Vendor. Club Auto Sport can refer you to one of our licensed Preferred Vendors that will be happy to give you a quote for your alcohol and beverages needs. You are free to use a non-preferred caterer; however, there is a $1500 non-preferred caterer fee.

### CAN I BRING IN MY OWN CATERER?

All events at Club Auto Sport use an outside caterer, and we welcome them to our facility. We have a wide variety of Preferred Caterers that offer different types of cuisines and price points. While we strongly encourage you to use one of our preferred caterers, we do realize that you may already have a relationship with another caterer. You are free to use a non-preferred caterer; however, there is a $10.00 per person ($1500 minimum) non-preferred caterer fee. A copy of their license, contract, and insurance for your event is mandatory.

### WHAT IS EVENT INSURANCE? WHY DO I NEED IT? HOW DO I GET IT?

Event insurance is for your overall safety. A “One Day Event Insurance” policy will protect you if one of your guests damages any Club Auto Sport or our tenants’ property. With the exception of your deductible, you would be able to file a claim on your insurance in order to avoid paying out-of-pocket damage expenses. You may obtain “One-Day Event Insurance” through your Homeowners or Car Insurance agency, or we will send you a link where you can obtain your insurance.

### ARE DOGS PERMITTED?

We know you love your fur babies and they can make a special addition to your event. However, only service dogs are allowed inside the facility.

### WHERE IS OUR PARKING?

Club Auto Sport guest parking is complimentary up to the general parking lot capacity. In order to facilitate the best use and convenience of this parking space for your guests, all events with over 175 guests will require parking attendant staff at Licensee’s expense. If your event wishes to have Valet Parking, we can recommend a private company to assist your needs at an additional charge.

### CAN WE HAVE FLOWER PETALS FOR THE BRIDE TO WALK ON?

Due to their slippery nature, real flower petals are prohibited. However, silk flower petals are permitted.

### CAN WE THROW RICE, BIRD SEED, CONFETTI, STREAMERS, or SILLY STRING?

NO, these items are not permitted at our facility.

### WHEN WILL WE HAVE A REHEARSAL?

The rehearsal time is scheduled for approximately one (1) hour the day before your ceremony and during normal business hours. The time for your rehearsal is charged at an additional hourly fee. When we book your ceremony, we will also book a rehearsal time. Please make sure your officiant and wedding planner are here to coordinate the ceremony and rehearsal for you.

### DO WE NEED MICROPHONES FOR THE SPEECHES?

Both during the wedding and the reception it is recommended that a microphone is used for the speeches. For your convenience, Club Auto Sport offers an in-hour system at an additional charge.

### CAN WE HAVE A CHUPPA/MANDEP?

Yes, but it does need to be self-supported or hand held.

### IS THERE A BRIDE’S ROOM?

Yes, in fact, we also have a Groom’s Room. We have large restrooms appointed for both men and women, electrical outlets, large mirrors, and lighting, which are perfect for the brides and grooms to do final touch-ups. We do recommend that you both come mostly dressed in your wedding attire and use the area for final touches. It is available one (1) hour before your ceremony time.

### I AM A GREAT PLANNER; DO I REALLY NEED A WEDDING PLANNER?

YES. This is some of the best advice one could give a bride and groom. Your wedding is a very important day for you and we want to make sure you enjoy every minute of It.…we strongly encourage you to have a “day of” wedding planner. This is our only point of contact during your wedding. All requests for changes to your already planned event must go through your planner. Your planner must come to the rehearsal and the final review meeting. The planner is also welcome to come to all planning meetings.

### MY AUNTIE MAKES GREAT FOOD, CAN SHE COOK FOR EVERYONE?

It’s always nice to have family that prepares their special dishes − however, Club Auto Sport must follow the health code provisions for food service. We encourage you to select from our list of preferred caterers who maintain a high level of excellence in food preparation, storage, and presentation. We only allow caterers that have a State of California Catering License, along with the proper catering insurance to serve guests.

### I’M HAVING MY CEREMONY AND RECEPTION AT CLUB AUTO SPORT; CAN I BREAK UP THE DAY IN BETWEEN?

If you are holding your ceremony and reception at Club Auto Sport, they must be consecutive in time and date, or additional labor charges may apply.
