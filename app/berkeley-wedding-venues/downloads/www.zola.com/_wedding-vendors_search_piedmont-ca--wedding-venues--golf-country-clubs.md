Andrea and Sally are the most attentive, responsive, professional, and kind venue coordinators out there. Our wedding was a beautiful success because of them and the SCC staff. They know how to host a wedding -- and it shows. We valued their expertise every step of the way. They've hosted so many weddings that they had great suggestions and solutions to every single thing that came up. Their recommended vendors list is valuable and we used it to hire our great day of coordinator. The venue is beautiful and well cared for inside and out. It shows in our pictures. All of the chairs, linens, glassware, cake stands, etc. were in great condition. The building and grounds are lovely so we didn't need excessive decorations or flowers. We don't live locally and planned the wedding from across the country -- it wasn't an issue with how well organized SCC is. It rained the night before our wedding and was unexpectedly a little colder than we anticipated -- Andrea and Sally helped us adjust our day of plans-- we kept the ceremony outside but moved cocktail hour inside with only a couple hour notice -- no one was stressed, they took care of it all. We had 150 people for an outdoor ceremony and indoor dinner and dancing. Lastly -- we were very happy with the pricing (so many things are included, and if they aren't already included, they're happy to arrange just about anything else!). We felt every single dollar was well spent. We can't recommend the venue enough -- the biggest thank you to Andrea, Sally, and the SCC staff.”Merril & D., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/sequoyah-country-club)

![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We had our wedding at Fairview Metropolitan, and it was everything we could have hoped for and more! The real star of the day was our incredible wedding coordinator, Trish. From the moment we started planning to the very last dance, she went above and beyond to make sure every detail was perfect. She kept us calm, handled everything behind the scenes, and made the entire experience so seamless that we were able to simply enjoy our wedding day. Trish is truly the reason we had our dream wedding, and we cannot thank her enough for the care, dedication, and heart she put into making it all happen. Our families and guests were blown away by how beautiful, organized, and smooth the entire celebration was. Everyone was so impressed with the venue, and we received endless compliments throughout the night. On top of that, the food was absolutely delicious — huge shout out to Chef Maria and staff. Fairview Metropolitan gave us the most unforgettable day, with a level of service and quality that far exceeded our expectations. The best part? It was affordable for the value we received. We couldn’t recommend this venue, and especially Trish, more highly for anyone planning their wedding.”Carina, 4 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/bfaf5526-aff1-43d0-a7e0-a0fb9d6a73f5?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/fairview-metropolitan)

“Hiddenbrooke Hills is a phenomenal venue. What sold us on them initially was they provided a binder with every detail we could ever think of -- food, cake, florals, timeline (planning and day of), down to whether or not you wanted your pet in the wedding. They have a number of recommended/partnered vendors, but aside from linens and tables, catering, and bartender, you could opt in or out of any vendors you wanted to fully customize your day. And the catering and bartenders were excellent, and they have some excellent options for chairs, tables, and linens -- so don't let this deter you! They were incredible communicators and reassured us every step of the way. The entire team really went above and beyond. Our day-of coordinator Christina was friendly, organized, gave us space when we needed but kept us to our timeline, and really made us feel like guests at our own wedding in the best way possible. Our banquet captain Eric went out of his way to ensure that us as well as our immediate families were treated like royalty the entire night, and we truly felt like honored guests on our own wedding day. The venue itself is very romantic. The outdoor ceremony site feels private and the aisle and archway is actually paved for the bridal party -- a game-changer for anyone wearing heels! We opted to do an indoor ceremony due to the weather, and the indoor ceremony site feels just as well thought out and romantic as the outdoor option. It felt like a log cabin surrounded by greenery. The entire walkway from indoor ceremony site to cocktail hour location to reception is covered. The cocktail hour location is a cute fireside area with enormous windows and exposed stonework. It feels cozy and was a perfect space for our guests. It also is adjacent to our reception area, which was perfect if our guests wanted a quieter place to chat during open dancing. The reception area is super romantic with white drapery and enormous windows, with doors that can be propped open for crossflow and a quiet HVAC system to keep everyone comfortable. Of all the venues we looked at, we felt like we got the best deal for the price here. It was simple to create a custom wedding without feeling "railroaded", but still have enough options to feel guided instead of lost. Everything -- from the partnered vendors, to the site, to the staff -- felt like it was a luxury experience. Definitely check out Hiddenbrooke -- you won't be disappointed!”Karina A., 10 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/hiddenbrooke-hills-by-wedgewood-weddings)

Their communication throughout the planning process was top-notch, and they were always available to answer any questions we had.

![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Fairview Napa was a wonderful choice for our wedding venue. From the start, their communication was quick, responsive, and concise, making the planning process smooth and stress-free. The venue itself was beautiful, and we loved being able to have our ceremony and reception outdoors - it really fit our vision perfectly. The staff was amazing and helped execute our event flawlessly. The only downside was that while Fairview Napa is an all-inclusive venue, the included vendors for things like the florals and cake were not up to the quality we were hoping for, so we had to upgrade those services, which is extra money. I highly recommend their DJ and Officiant services, they helped contribute to making the day extra special. After upgrading services, we were also very pleased with the florist and the aesthetics of the cake! Overall though, the value was great and we wouldn't hesitate to recommend Fairview Napa to any couple looking for a stunning Napa wedding location. Special shout out to Valerie, our wedding coordinator, who worked with us the entire planning process. She is great at her job and her years of experience shine through!”Chelsea G., 4 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/0e895501-c9cc-491b-a997-08d42a9f9078?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/fairview-napa)

“We had a wonderful experience working with the Saratoga Country Club for our wedding. From the very beginning and throughout the whole process, the event planner Sherry was always quick to respond and helpful with answering all my questions. The Country Club recently repainted and re-carpeted their reception room, and it looks so good! They had an event earlier in the day before our wedding, so I was super worried they wouldn't be able to set everything up quickly enough, but they did an amazing job! I had a minute to see the reception room before the ceremony, and they had arranged and decorated everything exactly how I had specified. The day-of reception coordinator, Mara, was also wonderful. She was super attentive and helpful, even checking on our parents multiple times throughout the evening to make sure they were happy.

Their expertise and knowledge of the venue and the wedding planning process took a lot of the stress off of us. The property itself is absolutely beautiful, with multiple areas that allowed us to get creative and make the space our own.

## About wedding venues in Piedmont, CA

### 

California offers an incredible 840 miles of coastline, 3,000+ wineries and ancient redwoods for your wedding day. When you choose the Golden State, you're getting exceptional natural lighting for your ceremony across diverse settings from Mediterranean coastal zones to alpine mountain backdrops. Each region has its own distinctive character that can perfectly match your vision.

### What Makes California Wedding Venues So Special?

Northern California's Napa Valley welcomes you with rolling vineyards and Spanish colonial architecture where intimate wine cave ceremonies create unforgettable moments. Head to Southern California and you'll find oceanfront venues like Duke's Malibu where you can exchange vows with the Pacific stretching out behind you while enjoying fresh coastal-inspired cuisine. Palm Springs offers dramatic desert venues with mountain backdrops and striking midcentury modern architecture that photographs beautifully.

### How Much Do Wedding Venues in California Cost?

Wedding venues in California typically run between $9,600 and $11,700 which aligns nicely with the national range of $6,500-$12,000. This represents about 18% of your total wedding budget. Your overall costs will vary based on guest count:

  * 50 guests: $26,190
  * 100 guests: $43,692
  * 150 guests: $60,141
  * 200 guests: $74,836
  * 250 guests: $89,530
  * 300 guests: $104,224



### Which California Venues Are Fully Accessible?

The Griffith House features wheelchair-accessible pathways throughout its Spanish-style grounds including the private ceremony lawn and separate preparation spaces for couples. You might also consider Holman Ranch Sunstone Winery and Villa del Sol d'Oro though you'll want to directly confirm their specific accessibility features when you visit. Accessibility options have improved greatly across California venues in recent years.

### When Should You Book Your California Wedding Venue?

October leads venue inquiries in California with couples typically booking venues about 13 months (400 days) before their wedding date. If you're dreaming of a Northern California wine country wedding during peak season you'll want to book up to 18 months in advance. Southern California venues offer more flexibility especially during winter months when you can still enjoy beautiful weather while potentially securing better rates.

### Where Can You Find Exceptional Culinary Experiences in California?

La Valencia Hotel in La Jolla delivers impeccable service with menu options from lobster bisque to perfectly prepared steak. You'll love Vibiana in Los Angeles with its chef-driven menus served in a stunning restored cathedral setting. Rosewood Sand Hill in Menlo Park offers Michelin-star fine dining while Bali Hai Restaurant serves authentic Polynesian cuisine with breathtaking views overlooking San Diego Bay. California's culinary scene truly elevates the wedding experience.
