  * ### The BEST wedding venue ever! 

•Verified review

•Serena J.•Oct 3, 2025

Oh my goodness, where to begin! Boulder Ridge by Wedgewood Weddings was a dream come true!! My husband and I had a shorter (6-month) engagement, and right when we walked into our tour at Boulder Ridge we knew it was the spot for us, and felt instantly taken care of. The organization and friendly care that the staff gave us made wedding planning manageable and FUN! Shoutout to Melissa - her friendly and confident demeanor was what sealed the deal for us to sign with Boulder Ridge for our big day. Their technology and wedding planning communication is easy to use, and helped us check off tasks efficiently. I have countless good things to say about the wedding day-of. Kelli was our on-site coordinator and she did a fabulous job organizing all of our friends and family to have an organized and beautiful ceremony. I got unexpectedly very sick on the wedding day, and was sick throughout the first look all the way until our dance floor. Kelli was incredible and rose to the occasion, staying by my side caring for me so graciously, while directing traffic with our banquet captain Emily to ensure the evening went off as smoothly as possible given the situation. They did an incredible job flipping our cocktail hour and ceremony times to give me time to feel well enough for the ceremony, so smoothly that none of our guests were even aware of the change! I 100% recommend Wedgewood Weddings, the Boulder Ridge location and team are all top-notch professional, elegant, and beautiful :)

  * ### Awesomeness!

•Verified review

•Kat B.•Aug 1, 2025

We just had our wedding at Boulder Ridge by Wedgewood Weddings, and it was incredible! The views were stunning, the venue was beautiful, and our guests are still talking about how amazing everything was. Huge thanks to the team for being so responsive and organized throughout the planning process. Special shoutout to Tiffany and Emily, our coordinators, for keeping everything on track and stress-free. And our DJ Brian was fantastic--super patient and kept the party going! We visited another venue before this, but choosing Boulder Ridge was the best decision. If you're considering it--go for it! No regrets. Thank you, Boulder Ridge, for making our day unforgettable!

  * ### Beautiful but at a cost with mid service 

•Verified review

•Natasha S.•Jun 1, 2025

This is an absolutely beautiful venue for a wedding. The average experience was nice, but I really felt there were things lacking day of. Overall communication was poor throughout the planning and day of. Pros: \- Beautiful \- Customizable options \- Inclusive package \- Food is good \- Bakery was good. IdoWeddingCakes \- DJ was great and really helped the day. Brian Laplace Cons: \- the shuttle service for guest from parking lot to venue was horrible. Guest were waiting in line for one golf cart to take 3 people at a time, very disappointed and affected guests experience. \- florist was not the easiest to work with. Flowers were wilting and browning when received and the incorrect boutonnieres were used. FlowerDivas \- the venue was late to set up, dance floor, tables and chairs, sweetheart backdrop was all being set up when bride and groom got to the venue. A lot seemed to be left behind from the wedding the day before. Silverware wasn't even placed on every place setting and guests had to ask for it. \- the security guard was walking through the reception area, very unprofessional and unnecessary \- the cake service was extremely slow and caused guest to miss out. Very disappointed \- along with slow set up several of the details we went over multiple times with the venue we're not followed through on day of. Just felt sloppy and lack of care. Overall it was a beautiful venue, but just felt slighted by day of details and follow through, especially for the price you pay for your special day here.

  * ### Absolute Best Place To get Married

•Verified review

•Alex M.•Dec 17, 2024

Boulder Ridge By Wedgewood Weddings was an absolute dream venue for our wedding. From the moment we began working with them, their communication was efficient, effective, helpful, and knowledgeable. The view from the ceremony sight was absolutely beautiful, the service was excellent, and the staff was extremely organized and attentive to our guests' needs. Angela, our coordinator, was an absolute pleasure to work with - she really took the time to get to know us as a couple and ensure our vision came to life seamlessly. Thanks to the high-quality vendors and well-thought out checklists provided by Wedgewood, our wedding day was low-stress and everything was set up perfectly prior to our arrival. We are so grateful to the entire team at Boulder Ridge for making our special day truly unforgettable.
