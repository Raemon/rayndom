Thirty years documenting our beautiful people, from set up portraiture to long lens candids. I know how to tell a moving and beautiful story. The wonderful part of living in the Bay Area is the diversity I experience and the divine rituals we share as a people. I've traveled to many countries to collect these precious moments. My heart is enormous, my prices still quite reasonable.

Intuitive and personable, I see light and composition in a unique way, causing the viewer to feel engaged in every moment. From start to finish, this event will be 'in the can', in an album and in our hearts forever more.

  * ### Beautiful Wedding

•Verified review

•Rick D.•7:00 pm

Our wedding was so fun. Reenie was a big part of it, both in the planning and the day of. She helped us think clearly through the photos that we wanted, how to pose them, and then joined in to capture so many precious images of the joy that ensued. She produced a gorgeous album for us, and gave us one precious picture that will always sit on the mantel. Reenie is smart, experienced, and brings such great energy to her work. I reccomend her highly.
