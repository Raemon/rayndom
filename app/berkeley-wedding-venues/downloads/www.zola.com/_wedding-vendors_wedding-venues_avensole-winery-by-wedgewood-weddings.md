•Verified review

•Lilianna R.•Jan 5, 2026

My husband and I had our wedding here in June 2025. The entire process start to finish was seamless with this Wedgewood venue. Their team was so helpful and attentive to every single detail! As a bride I was so nervous about everything being perfect and they did just that! On the day of the rehearsal we brought all our decorations and everything to them since they said they set it all up and I was amazing with how beautiful everything turned out! Their staff on every level was outstanding and each meeting we had during the planning process I felt confident that they had it all under control. They went through every step with us and it made the whole process so much less stressful. They paid so much attention to making sure my husband and I had everything we needed on the big day at all times. Incredible experience highly recommend this venue. It was so beautiful and private as well!

•Verified review

•Chelsey•Nov 22, 2025

We had the most beautiful wedding at Truffle Pig Winery by Wedgewood. From the fairytale-like venue to the planning team, to the food and dessert, everything truly exceeded our expectations. We planned our entire wedding in just three months, but the Wedgewood team kept us organized, on track and supported every step of the way. Choosing their all-inclusive package made the process so much easier, we didn’t have to stress about finding a caterer, DJ, or wedding planner because everything was seamlessly handled for us. This allowed us to focus on the décor and all the special details that made our day everything we could have ever wished for. Although we barely had time to eat, we heard from countless guests that the food was absolutely delicious. So many people raved about how great everything tasted. Our wedding day was perfect and we genuinely couldn’t be more grateful for the entire Wedgewood team. They are truly exceptional at what they do, and there was always someone available to answer questions, provide guidance and support us in every moment. I cannot say enough great things about Alison especially. She guided us through the planning process, our rehearsal and the entire wedding day with such professionalism, kindness and expertise. I’m someone who is extremely hands-on with every detail, yet Alison earned my complete trust. She handled everything so seamlessly that I was able to truly relax and be fully present, something I honestly didn’t think would be possible. She made sure every member of our wedding party felt supported and knew exactly where to be and when. She oversaw the setup of all our rentals, coordinated our décor and double-checked every detail to ensure everything looked perfect. She communicated with all our vendors, kept us on schedule and handled anything that came up before I even knew about it. She truly went above and beyond, she even stayed later than scheduled because I didn’t want her to leave. Because of Alison, our day was absolutely flawless. I also want to acknowledge and thank Maddie, Amanda, Ramey, and Crystal for being so kind, patient, and thorough throughout the entire planning process. These ladies never missed a single detail. Ramey was actually the first person we met and she gave us such a warm, informative tour of the venue. She answered all of our questions thoroughly and made us feel confident and excited from the very beginning. We are so grateful for this entire team and would recommend them wholeheartedly to any couple looking for a group of professionals who truly care and make the experience feel effortless.

  * ### READ THIS REVIEW - Best Decision ever 

•Verified review

•Zack T.•Nov 15, 2025

READ THIS REVIEW - Signing with Wedgewood Weddings is HANDS DOWN the best wedding decision we made. We recommend this decision to absolutely anyone; the time saved by having a complete, professional, experienced team who already have rock star vendors provided us the foundation to simply enjoy with our friends and family on the big day. Truffle pig was the first venue we viewed, and after meeting their entire team - we knew instantly we would be married here and in good hands (thanks Maddie for the time spent!). Wedgewood weddings made sure to hold our hands in the 9 months of wedding planning - and when we had a literal house fire 3 months before - the Wedgewood team sprung into action. Their communication was unmatched, they outlined every action item and gave us recommendations along the way. We have gone to over 30 weddings together and NO ONE has had a planning team like Wedgewood. Their experience with countless weddings gave us so much comfort - we knew they would solve problems so we didn't have to. They made wedding planning fun - and allowed "the bride to be a bride" - making decisions / coordinating so we could soak up the moments. Allison was our day of coordinator and she was simply perfect. Allison kept our bridal party in-line and efficient while ensuring everyone was laughing (yet keeping the bride and groom calm!). Her energy in the bridal suite is a moment the bride will always remember - with a calming yet excited presence. When the bride's dress unexpectedly ripped, she helped with a needle and thread to solve it! We cannot emphasize enough - Allison felt like a blessing we prayed for, and our day went perfect because of how happy she was while hustling in the background. The venue was gorgeous - our guests felt like they were seamlessly guided throughout the day (always with a drink in hand!). The food was exceptional (shoutout to the chef!) and the drinks went down easy. Wedgewood provided an unmatched efficiency - with a schedule, action items, checklists and multiple meetings to ensure our day was exactly as envisioned. Simply put - Wedgewood was worth every penny - and we were able to be present with our family and friends day of because we trusted Wedgewood had our backs.

  * ### Truffle Pig Winery

•Verified review

•Jenna V.•Nov 2, 2025

Truffle Pig Winery by Wedgewood Weddings was an absolute dream to work with. From the very first conversation, Alison and Crystal were incredibly communicative, attentive, and gave us their full attention. The space was absolutely beautiful, and every detail was exactly how I pictured it. The attention, care, and love they put into our day helped make it feel effortless and magical. Alison and Crystal went above and beyond for us on our wedding day, and the entire Wedgewood team was there supporting us every step of the way. It was the perfect day, and I am beyond grateful to have had them by our side!
