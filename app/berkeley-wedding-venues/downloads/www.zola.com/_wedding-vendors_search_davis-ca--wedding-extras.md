Festa is an AI event coordinator that transforms how modern events are run — starting with weddings. Instead of juggling group chats, spreadsheets, and endless back-and-forth, Festa manages RSVPs, guest questions, and real-time updates directly through text.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Using Festa was honestly one of the best choices we made. We had a three-day wedding weekend, and coordinating everything—from the welcome drinks to the farewell brunch—would’ve been a nightmare without it. Festa texted guests with the schedule, answered their questions (like “What time’s the shuttle?”), and even followed up with people who hadn’t RSVP’d yet. I didn’t even realize how much stress it was saving us until our friends with other weddings were freaking out. This should be standard at every wedding.”Danielle R., 6 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-extras/festa-ai--2)

*Dearest is not a photo booth. Dearest is a beautifully simple way to gather and preserve memories from weddings, showers, birthdays, retirements, and more. Guests share photos, videos, and heartfelt messages via a personalized QR code—after the event, so they can be fully present. Every package includes a private gallery to view, download, print, or turn into a curated photobook. We also offer printable QR code templates, signage, and display cards on Etsy, with 100% of profits benefiting Vow for Girls, a global movement to end child marriage. More than a guest book, Dearest keeps the joy, love, and laughter alive long after the celebration.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Me and my besties had a girls trip and we took SO MANY memorable photos. Instead of sending, sharing, remembering, etc., it was so easy for each of us to just post the photos to Dearest. Voila! Everything is compiled, organized and shared. We are all so happy to have this keepsake to remember such a fun trip/event. I recommend Dearest for anyone looking to gather photos/videos from multiple sources and to organize them.

I even used it for outdoor weddings and guest are always amazed it smells so good. For larger venues or outdoors, I’ve had the RTS team handle setup, while other times I rent and set it up myself (super easy with their step-by-step instructions). To get the most value, I use The Event package for both the ceremony and reception. I start it on a low setting for the ceremony, then move it to the ballroom at the start of cocktail hour—by the time guests arrive, the reception smells amazing. Two spaces beautifully scented for the price of one!”Planner: Eleventh H., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/a0faca03-917a-49c9-9e78-0ee64c5691b2?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-extras/rent-the-scent)
