  * ### Made Our Day So Easy and Special

•Verified review

•Tiana & M.•Oct 9, 2025

We couldn’t have asked for a better officiant! From the very beginning, Jasmine was professional, warm, and genuinely invested in making our ceremony personal and meaningful. She helped us with our vows and made the whole process so much easier. We honestly wouldn’t have known where to start without her guidance. The words she spoke during our ceremony were absolutely beautiful and felt like they captured us perfectly. What really made things even better was that she was also able to notarize our marriage certificate right after the ceremony, which saved us time and made everything so seamless. We’re so thankful for her attention to detail and the calm, confident energy she brought to such an important day!

  * ### Felt So Seen and Welcome!

•Verified review

•Arielle & S.•Oct 6, 2025

We honestly couldn’t have asked for a better experience. From the very beginning, Jasmine made us feel completely comfortable and welcomed. She was organized and professional, but also super warm and easy to talk to. It was clear that she creates a space where LGBTQ couples and all clients feel included and respected. Everything went smoothly, and we never felt rushed or stressed. It just made the whole process feel easy, personal, and joyful. Thank you so much!

## Frequently asked questions

6 Answers

Ask them a question

### How long have you been in business?

I’ve been in business as a wedding officiant since 2024, and over that time I’ve had the joy of officiating a variety of ceremonies, from intimate elopements to culturally rich weddings. I’m passionate about helping couples create meaningful and memorable moments on their special day.

### Can we personalize our ceremony?

Absolutely! Every couple is unique, and your ceremony should reflect your story. Whether it’s personal vows, meaningful readings, or special touches, I’m happy to help you create a ceremony that feels authentic and true to your relationship.

### Do you do rehearsals? Is that included in your cost?

Rehearsal attendance is included only with the Forever and Always Ceremony Package for up to one hour. If you’d like to add a rehearsal to any other package, I offer it for $75 for the first hour and $50 for each additional hour.

### We’re legally married already. Can you still do our ceremony?

Absolutely! Even if you’re already legally married, I can officiate a celebratory ceremony or vow renewal to honor your love and commitment. We can create a meaningful experience that reflects your journey together.

### Do you provide or require premarital counseling?

I do not require premarital counseling, but it is included in the Forever and Always Ceremony Package. If you’d like, premarital counseling can also be added to any package, ranging from 1 to 3 sessions. These sessions are offered through the Love + Partnership packages, each designed to help couples strengthen communication, reflect on their relationship, and build a strong foundation. Each Love + Partnership package includes guided exercises, discussion prompts, and reflection notes, with options tailored to the couple’s needs. Full pricing and details for each session are available in the package descriptions.

### What is the deposit and payment process for your officiant packages and additional sessions?

For all officiant packages (Sweet & Simple Ceremony, Classic I Do, and Forever and Always Ceremony), a 50% nonrefundable deposit is required to secure your date. The remaining balance is due 14 days prior to the ceremony and can be split into payments. If your ceremony date is within a few days up to a month away, full payment is due at the time of booking. For any vow assistance or Love + Partnership sessions, full payment is due at the time of booking to secure your session date(s).
