I had an art gallery show and celebration of living. The staff was quick to reply to my emails and generous with their support. The day of the art exhibit the staff was helpful and kind. They kept an eye on me better than my own family, bringing me food and drinks. The food was good and I had 7 passed appetizers and a prime rib carving station. I was so happy and impressed with my choice of venue.”Joy D., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/5cd1e0a9-22b6-42eb-b0c2-d1c2b4ad89b0?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/san-ramon-by-wedgewood-weddings)

![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“My husband and I were engaged in October 2023 and began looking at wedding venues the month after. We then finalized our booking with Redwood Canyon in January 2024 to give ourselves ample time for planning and financing for our big day on May 26th, 2025. Since we live on the East Coast and majority of our families reside in the Bay Area, we wanted to find a venue that could provide an all-inclusive package and bring our vision to reality - and Redwood Canyon checked all of those boxes... even going above and beyond. We are very happy with the entire process that led up to our special day and the outcome of our wedding. *1 year prior to the wedding* They kept us updated with some of the renovations they were making at the time. When we wanted to do a physical tour in June 2024, they fitted us into the schedule and showed us the actual colors of table cloths, napkins, lighting, etc. *8 months prior to the wedding* The wedding team sent us an invitation to the Fall Wedding Extravaganza Fair for late October 2024. We unfortunately couldn't make it, but they accommodated us by including our friend couple residing in the Bay Area to take over our place. Our friend couple FaceTimed us during the entire event to make us feel like we were there! They commented how it was nice to try out all the food options they had in the package to know what foods the couple would like to finalize for their wedding day. They also enjoyed the fun activities the DJ curated - there were two opportunities to win a prize from those activities. *5 months prior to the wedding* This was a two-hour call with the wedding team to go over our vision and details. I forgot the name of the person assisting us, but she was very patient and fun to talk with! She reassured us that if there were changes we'd like to make over the next few months, they'd be happy to accommodate. A few months later, vendors contacted us to further discuss additional details - officiant, cake, DJ, and florist. *1 week prior to the wedding* We had Jacoby as our amazing wedding coordinator and Ana to assist on our special day. They reviewed and confirmed details as well as what to expect on our Rehearsal Day, which was a day prior to our wedding. We loved their positive attitudes and professionalism throughout the process! *Wedding Day* Despite how fast and chaotic it felt, we truly appreciate Jacoby and Ana for keeping us on the right pace, consistently checking in with us, and making sure we were happy and comfortable throughout the day. If there was something I, my husband, our wedding party, and family needed, they were quick to provide it. They also knew where to put our decor and took some behind-the-scenes photos to share with us after our wedding. We had our photographer, Hayden from A Perfect Impression, who suggested all the right poses, shots, angles, and places to take our photos. Our DJ, Saul, was very accommodating with a song request and some changes that we communicated through email and text - the vibe of the ceremony and reception was perfect. The food was fantastic, the photobooth provided high-quality images that we could receive through a texted link. *Overall* If we could rate it more than 5 stars, we totally would! We are truly happy that we chose Redwood Canyon for our wedding - an amazing and friendly team with a beautiful venue that accommodated 80 of our guests!”Lynda N., 8 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/9ef28f28-6fc6-45f2-883e-be11de6a7062?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/redwood-canyon-by-wedgewood-weddings)

Built in 1902 by the renowned architect Bernard Maybeck in traditional Arts and Crafts style, it's designed to create a cozy, intimate feeling. The crowning glory of the club is the three-story Great Hall. With its vaulted ceiling, massive stone fireplace, and stained-glass windows featuring heraldic crests of the great universities of the world, it's reminiscent of many a European cathedral. Light from the floor-to-ceiling windows warms the redwood paneling and suffuses the Hall in a golden glow. Two charming smaller spaces are also available for functions. The Heyns and Seaborg rooms (named respectively after a chancellor and a distinguished University Nobel Laureate) both have French doors leading to a private outdoor area with a garden view. The Faculty Club has been serving its members and guests for over 100 years and will do everything possible to make your event successful and enjoyable.Why you'll love this venue

“We were looking for a beautiful low key venue for our wedding. The Lighthouse was by far even better than we imagined! We primarily worked with Maggie who was fantastic! She was very realistic when it came to helping us stay within our budget and gave us some excellent vendor recommendations accordingly. We had a few meetings with her along the way and she listened to what we wanted and helped us stay on task getting everything sorted out. She was super flexible and accommodating with us on the day of the wedding. Maggie and Alma were both there the day of the wedding and they were both busy making sure everything was running smoothly! In addition to how wonderful they are, this venue is the most beautiful! We used the outside and inside area. We heard from several of our guests that it was the most beautiful venue (and wedding ;) ) they had attended! We have the absolute best memories from this day and wouldn’t change a thing!”Rachel D., 3 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-lighthouse-glen-cove-marina)

“Hiddenbrooke Hills is a phenomenal venue. What sold us on them initially was they provided a binder with every detail we could ever think of -- food, cake, florals, timeline (planning and day of), down to whether or not you wanted your pet in the wedding. They have a number of recommended/partnered vendors, but aside from linens and tables, catering, and bartender, you could opt in or out of any vendors you wanted to fully customize your day. And the catering and bartenders were excellent, and they have some excellent options for chairs, tables, and linens -- so don't let this deter you! They were incredible communicators and reassured us every step of the way. The entire team really went above and beyond. Our day-of coordinator Christina was friendly, organized, gave us space when we needed but kept us to our timeline, and really made us feel like guests at our own wedding in the best way possible. Our banquet captain Eric went out of his way to ensure that us as well as our immediate families were treated like royalty the entire night, and we truly felt like honored guests on our own wedding day. The venue itself is very romantic. The outdoor ceremony site feels private and the aisle and archway is actually paved for the bridal party -- a game-changer for anyone wearing heels! We opted to do an indoor ceremony due to the weather, and the indoor ceremony site feels just as well thought out and romantic as the outdoor option. It felt like a log cabin surrounded by greenery. The entire walkway from indoor ceremony site to cocktail hour location to reception is covered. The cocktail hour location is a cute fireside area with enormous windows and exposed stonework. It feels cozy and was a perfect space for our guests. It also is adjacent to our reception area, which was perfect if our guests wanted a quieter place to chat during open dancing. The reception area is super romantic with white drapery and enormous windows, with doors that can be propped open for crossflow and a quiet HVAC system to keep everyone comfortable. Of all the venues we looked at, we felt like we got the best deal for the price here. It was simple to create a custom wedding without feeling "railroaded", but still have enough options to feel guided instead of lost. Everything -- from the partnered vendors, to the site, to the staff -- felt like it was a luxury experience. Definitely check out Hiddenbrooke -- you won't be disappointed!”Karina A., 10 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/hiddenbrooke-hills-by-wedgewood-weddings)

“We had the absolute best experience hosting our wedding here. Natasha Norman was incredible to work with through the entire planning process. She was clear on pricing, set our expectations well, was incredibly responsive, and helped coordinate the event on the day of the wedding. We asked for some extra time to set up the room and, since the room hadn't been booked the day before the event, she let us come in the day prior to get everything in order. Natasha spoke with our DJ and coordinated for his set-up, which was very helpful. The team setting up the event also did the perfect job of setting up the tables and outdoor chairs exactly as we'd asked. I changed my mind on the arch at the last minute, and they had no problem making the change. The wedding was incredible, our guests felt comfortable in their rooms and were pleased they could bring their dogs so they didn't have to hire a dog-sitter. Everyone was impressed by the view and by the fact that the sun was setting behind the sweetheart table in the Bayview Ballroom. I also want to give a shoutout to the banquet manager who made us feel at home, kindly brought us beverages as we were setting up, and took care of us throughout the stay. I’ve received at least half a dozen compliments on the qualify of the food served, and I felt the pricing was very reasonable – especially when compared to other hotels on the water nearby. I also loved that the hotel provided us a contingency plan if we needed to move our outdoor wedding to the indoors because of rain or anything else. We truly felt special and valued and would use this venue again in a heartbeat.”Lindsey M., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-doubletree-by-hilton-berkeley-marina)

“The Omni made an incredible first impression on us. It’s a beautiful & grand space, but there was something very comfortable about it at the same time. That’s mainly due to Jano Paredes, our event coordinator. He was so welcoming & genuinely passionate about creating a special event for us. We toured two other venues, Julia Morgan & Webster Hall. While these two venues are beautiful, there weren’t nearly as caring or appreciative of our business as the Omni. The Omni made the stressful planning process enjoyable (we planned it in about 3 months!) & they were understanding when we had last minute changes & requests. They were also very flexible throughout the wedding planning. They even swapped out some of the beer in their package so they could bring in brands we liked better. Amanda Maggard is amazing. She managed the accommodations for all the guests. Many of our guests also commented on how incredible the check-in was. It was rainy that weekend, so the Omni was quick to offer complimentary umbrellas. They even gave each guest a free drink voucher at the hotel bar! Amanda also made sure I had everything I needed to be comfortable in the Presidential Suite, complete with champagne, ice buckets, & several glasses for my visitors. It’s a lovely space to take getting-ready pictures. I was originally worried the grand ballroom wasn’t going to fit our vision & was torn on using the same space for the ceremony & reception (they have another room available if you’d prefer not to do this), but it was gorgeous! The spaces felt totally unique between the ceremony & the reception. The grand ballroom really provides a blank slate to create something beautiful & it can be difficult to appreciate when it’s completely empty. The mezzanine where the cocktail hour was held is beautiful & needs no additional decorations & the dim sum buffet was a huge hit. Guests loved the reception dinner menu. We went with a plated dinner selection of sea bass, chicken, or oyster mushrooms. The crab soup was delicious & by far the most popular. The passion fruit cheesecake was exceptional, but we also offered our guests a lovely Marjolaine cake slice. Later that evening, the Presidential suite where I initially got ready was transformed into our honeymoon suite. We were greeted with chocolate covered strawberries, champagne, & two custom Omni robes with our initials embroidered on them (my new initials since I was changing my name). It was so touching that it brought tears to our eyes. The Financial District was the optimal neighborhood to host our wedding. It was very safe & picturesque. We had a several family members nervous about coming to San Francisco because of the negative media coverage, but they all fell in love with the city by the end of the weekend. I know Webster Hall wouldn’t have given us the same treatment (they didn’t seem to care if they had our business or not). Julia Morgan was wonderful, but with the Omni, we just had a feeling we’d be in the best possible hands by people who genuinely cared, & we were right. Now, we love the Omni so much that we had Valentine’s Day at Monte’s two weeks after our wedding & the hotel surprised us with dessert & champagne, as well as a card signed by their staff congratulating us on our wedding. It’s a bar we now frequent because of the quality of service, food/drinks, & of course, our wonderful memories there. The Omni was the absolute best decision of our entire wedding.”Seana P., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/omni-hotel-san-francisco)

“We loved the idea of booking a reception venue that already had an incredible staff in-house. GAMH provided us with great care and kind but honest input every step of the way. The event coordinator (the fabulous Mandy!), audio, lighting, catering, servers, bar service, coat check…..was perfection because the team is their own and prideful for the space and its legendary music history. It was special to introduce so many out-of-town guests to this beautiful classic of a venue in the heart of our city and dance the night away. We’ll never forget it and will enjoy attending shows that much more forever.”Emily R., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/great-american-music-hall)

“We hosted our wedding at the Presidio Officers' Club and had truly the most special, incredible day of our lives. It was clean, well-organized, with delicious food and friendly staff. Not to mention, the planning team at the Presidio, through Wedgewood Weddings, was truly best-in-class. Wedgewood prepared us so well, providing a planning binder and step-by-step instructions. They checked in with us multiple times, providing walk-throughs, and answering every question extremely promptly. We especially loved our planner and day-of coordinator, Christian, who went out of his way to make everything so seamless. Christian taught us how to do our ceremony, including little details such as hand placement, went out of his way to accommodate a creative painting engagement, and provided private time for us newlyweds. He was perfect! So grateful to this beautiful venue and our wonderful team. We will treasure our experience with Wedgewood forever.”Natasha H., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/4ee55ad9-e863-4cba-a1fb-b459a421b4da?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/officers-club-at-the-presidio)

“The pricing on here is wrong. The venue fee alone is almost 30k. Then the food and beverage minimum is 50k but if you have 150 guests you will spend more like 80k. Plus there is a service fee of at least 13k. So BEFORE photographer, footwear, videographer, band, decor etc. you’re already at around 123k.”Jane, 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/stanly-ranch)

“Having our wedding at The San Francisco Theological Seminary was one of the easiest and best decisions we made when planning for our wedding! As soon as we stepped foot on the campus, we knew it was the venue we’d been looking for. Working with the staff here (big thank you to Jeremiah Jenkins!!) was low stress and straightforward. Many other venues we looked at just didn’t feel right and felt overly complicated.

## About wedding venues in Clayton, CA

### 

California offers an incredible 840 miles of coastline, 3,000+ wineries and ancient redwoods for your wedding day. When you choose the Golden State, you're getting exceptional natural lighting for your ceremony across diverse settings from Mediterranean coastal zones to alpine mountain backdrops. Each region has its own distinctive character that can perfectly match your vision.

### What Makes California Wedding Venues So Special?

Northern California's Napa Valley welcomes you with rolling vineyards and Spanish colonial architecture where intimate wine cave ceremonies create unforgettable moments. Head to Southern California and you'll find oceanfront venues like Duke's Malibu where you can exchange vows with the Pacific stretching out behind you while enjoying fresh coastal-inspired cuisine. Palm Springs offers dramatic desert venues with mountain backdrops and striking midcentury modern architecture that photographs beautifully.

### How Much Do Wedding Venues in California Cost?

Wedding venues in California typically run between $9,600 and $11,700 which aligns nicely with the national range of $6,500-$12,000. This represents about 18% of your total wedding budget. Your overall costs will vary based on guest count:

  * 50 guests: $26,190
  * 100 guests: $43,692

Accessibility options have improved greatly across California venues in recent years.

### When Should You Book Your California Wedding Venue?

October leads venue inquiries in California with couples typically booking venues about 13 months (400 days) before their wedding date. If you're dreaming of a Northern California wine country wedding during peak season you'll want to book up to 18 months in advance. Southern California venues offer more flexibility especially during winter months when you can still enjoy beautiful weather while potentially securing better rates.
