  * ### A magical day came true! 

•Verified review

•Angela M.•Oct 15, 2025

Fairview Crystal Springs was an absolute dream venue for our wedding! From the moment we first reached out, the team - especially Lindsey and Abbie - were incredibly responsive, quick to help, and went above and beyond to make our day magical. The venue itself is truly stunning, with beautiful grounds and an amazing crew that handled any issues we had with such care and ease. Everything felt seamless and the final result was absolutely breathtaking - I couldn't have asked for a better team or experience! The Fairview Crystal Springs team made our dream wedding a reality, and I would highly recommend them to any couple looking for an amazing venue with an even more amazing crew.
