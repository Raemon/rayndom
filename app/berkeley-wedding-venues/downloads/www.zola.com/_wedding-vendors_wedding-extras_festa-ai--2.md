  * ### You’d be crazy to plan a wedding without Festa

•Verified review

•Sofia M.•Jul 17, 2025

We had 180 guests flying in from three different time zones, and I was terrified of missing something. Festa handled everything—flight-delay alerts, last-minute schedule tweaks, even nudging my forgetful cousin to choose a meal option. My phone stayed blissfully quiet because guests just texted Festa whenever they needed an answer. I actually got to enjoy the rehearsal dinner instead of playing cruise director. If you value your sanity, get Festa.

  * ###  Every couple needs this. Period.

•Verified review

•Danielle R.•Jul 17, 2025

Using Festa was honestly one of the best choices we made. We had a three-day wedding weekend, and coordinating everything—from the welcome drinks to the farewell brunch—would’ve been a nightmare without it. Festa texted guests with the schedule, answered their questions (like “What time’s the shuttle?”), and even followed up with people who hadn’t RSVP’d yet. I didn’t even realize how much stress it was saving us until our friends with other weddings were freaking out. This should be standard at every wedding.

  * ### Seriously a lifesaver

•Verified review

•jessica•Jul 17, 2025

I cannot say enough good things about Festa. I was overwhelmed trying to keep guests updated—especially with last-minute changes—and Festa totally saved me. It’s like having a super organized friend who actually replies to everyone’s texts. Guests could just message Festa for things like the dress code, parking info, or to RSVP. I didn’t have to field dozens of texts the week of the wedding. It even reminded people about events and helped with headcounts. Worth every penny.

  * ### A Game-Changer for Wedding Stress

•Verified review

•Emma J.•Jul 17, 2025

As a bride with a packed schedule, I was skeptical about relying on an AI for my wedding coordination. But Festa AI blew me away. It handled guest inquiries about the venue and timeline flawlessly, saving me hours of phone calls and texts. The setup was smooth, and when I had a quick question, the support team was on it instantly. It’s like having a super-efficient assistant who never sleeps. Highly recommend for any couple!
