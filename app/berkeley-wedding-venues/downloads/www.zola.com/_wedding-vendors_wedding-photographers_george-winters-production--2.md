Beginning my journey in the world of filmmaking, I initially delved into the realms of music videos and commercials, honing my craft in storytelling and visual artistry. However, it was a serendipitous opportunity to work as a cameraman at a wedding that unveiled my true passion. Now, with 9 years under my belt and hundreds of weddings captured, my love for crafting heartfelt wedding photographs continues to grow, reaching couples across the nation.

My unique storytelling approach, blending candid moments with artistic flair, ensures each photo captures the genuine essence and emotion of your special day, setting me apart from other photographers.

  * ### The Best Decision We Made for Our Wedding!

•Verified review

•Paulina N.•Oct 27, 2025

We couldn’t be happier with our photos! George was super easy to work with from the start. quick to respond, gave great direction, and made us feel totally comfortable in front of the camera. Which is saying a lot because we’re usually awkward in photos... haha On the wedding day, they were calm, professional, and somehow managed to catch every special moment without ever feeling intrusive. The photos turned out even better than we imagined. If you’re getting married in Las Vegas and want someone who actually cares about your experience, George is the one.

  * ### Amazing!! 

•Verified review

•Anna•Sep 18, 2024

George is honestly the best photographer we could’ve asked forbwe can’t stop talking about him to our friends! His photos have this amazing earthy, warm vibe, and he really knows how to capture the adventurous side of things. He’s not just talented, though, he’s super responsive and always willing to work with you. Seriously, if you’re thinking about hiring him, do it. You won’t regret it.
