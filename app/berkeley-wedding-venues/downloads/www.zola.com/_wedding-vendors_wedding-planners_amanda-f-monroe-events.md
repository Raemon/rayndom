  * ### AMAZING Coordinator!!

•Verified review

•Carlie S.•Dec 14, 2025

We had a wonderful experience working with Amanda as our Day-Of Coordinator for our wedding this past October! From our first meeting with her, we could tell that Amanda really cared about what she does, and it is very obvious to see how much effort she puts into everything. She is extremely caring, communicative, efficient, and helpful! She provided us with great planning resources and information, and scheduled frequent check-ins to make sure we felt comfortable in the planning process. We knew that everything would run smoothly on our wedding day because of her dedication, organizational skills, and knowledge of the wedding industry. We had a sort of unconventional wedding day schedule, which made many aspects of planning and decor set-up a lot more difficult. Amanda tackled these challenges with ease! She coordinated with our vendors and event staff in order to make everything perfect! We are so grateful that we found Amanda! She is so supportive, organized, and great at what she does! She made sure our day was perfect, and we are so lucky to have had her as a coordinator!

  * ### The Best Decision We Made for Our Wedding

•Verified review

•Gabriella•Jul 31, 2025

Oh my goodness, where do I even begin. Amanda Monroe is an absolute godsend. We paid for her day-of coordination package, and she went above and beyond, as we were in contact so many times leading up to the wedding. She was always there for us and was always willing to meet to help ease our stress and answer the millions of questions we had. She is incredibly helpful and truly invaluable. She knows her stuff and gets it done. Leading up to the wedding, Amanda was the one who helped me de-stress in regards to all of the logistics, deadlines, finances, and details. On the day of our wedding, we all felt at peace and a huge sense of calmness because we knew she would take care of everything for us. And she did. And I didn't have to worry about a single thing because I knew she had everything covered. I was able to be present for and enjoy every single moment of my wedding because of her. Booking A. Monroe Events was the best decision we made for our wedding! I cannot recommend her or her services more!

  * ### Incredible job as our day-of coordinator

•Verified review

•Greg H.•May 4, 2025

Amanda was our day-of coordinator and she did an incredible job. In the weeks leading up the wedding, she was communicative and organized. A few days before the wedding, she even drove over to our house to pick up various decorations and props so that we wouldn't have to worry about it on the day-of, which was super helpful. On the day-of, Amanda did an amazing job ensuring everything went according to plan. Our wedding had many small details that would be easy to lose track of, but Amanda was on top of things. We couldn't have been more happy with our day-of coordinator and are so thankful that Amanda helped make our special day go smoothly.

  * ### Amanda Absolutely Exceptional!

•Verified review

•Michael L.•Jul 29, 2024

From the moment we first met her, it was clear that Amanda was incredibly organized, reliable, and thoughtful. Amanda meticulously planned every detail, ensuring that nothing was overlooked. Her checklists and timelines kept everything on track, and her proactive communication made us feel confident and relaxed leading into the big day. On the wedding day, she coordinated seamlessly with our vendors, ensuring everything ran smoothly and on schedule. She also kept us on track during the day without being intrusive or pushy and ensured that we got to truly enjoy all of the events of the day without having to worry about any of the coordination behind the scenes. Thanks to her, we were able to fully enjoy it all without any stress or worries. Moreover, Amanda's thoughtfulness truly set her apart. She took the time to get to know us as a couple, understanding our vision and personalizing every aspect of our wedding to reflect our preferences. Her suggestions were always spot-on, and she went above and beyond to add special touches that made our day even more memorable. She went above and beyond to ensure that our wedding looked exactly as we wanted it and that our guests truly enjoyed their own experiences. Amanda's dedication and expertise made our wedding day truly magical. We are so grateful for her hard work and would highly recommend her to any couple looking for a wedding coordinator who is organized, thoughtful, and reliable. She truly made our dreams come true!

## Frequently asked questions

4 Answers

Ask them a question

### Do you take on multiple weddings in a day?

I am committed exclusively to one wedding couple throughout their entire event, ensuring undivided attention and dedicated service from start to finish. I do not schedule multiple events in a single day.

### Who will we be working with?

Based on the scale of the event, you will collaborate with me, and I may also occasionally involve an assistant.

### How much time should we expect to spend with you?

I customize each event to cater to the specific needs of every couple. As part of my service, I ensure frequent communication through multiple check-ins in the lead-up to the event.

### Do you also plan other events, like showers or rehearsal dinners?

Absolutely! Please share your thoughts, and we will work together to bring them to life!
