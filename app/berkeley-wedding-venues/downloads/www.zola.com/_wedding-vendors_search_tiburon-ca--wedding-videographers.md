Interstellar Films was founded with the desire to create gorgeous, handcrafted films that capture the spirit, love and joy of your special day. Our crew spends the day with couples from the preparation stages all the way through the reception ensuring we capture the ceremony, cake-cutting, speeches, first look and dances.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“My wife was super skeptical about hiring a videographer, so we ended up searching for one only 2 months before the wedding. We are so grateful that we found and hired Interstellar Films. I loved the selection of music for our video. On my wedding day, Sebastien was on time, professional, so friendly, and somehow managed to blend into the scene, even with all of their equipment and lights. Most importantly, I am IN LOVE with our final product!!! He captured exactly what we wanted from our wedding day - the wild dancing, emotional vows, poignant toasts, and the all encompassing love and excitement from our family and friends. Thank you so so so much for giving me a wedding video that I will cherish forever.”Mark L., a month ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-videographers/interstellar-films)

Brendan was easy to communicate with and was able to answer all of our questions. The way Brendan filmed our wedding was truly magical. One unique thing Brendan did was filming aerial views of our wedding venue with his drone. He used top of the line equipment to film our wedding and didn’t miss any important shots. The highlight video and long video Brendan provided us was breathtaking. The videos were high quality, and the music chosen truly matched our wedding. We want to say thank you Brendan for your thoughtfulness, and flexibility working with us. The videos you made for us will be something that we cherish forever.

  * Storytelling style
  * Starts at $1,500 

Growing up in New Zealand, England and the US means I've had my fair share of adventures. I’ve spent 15 years telling stories through video, poetry, and photography - and the weddings I capture are rooted in that same deep attention to detail and care. With my sister as second shooter, a couple drones (Bug & Sheldon), and a documentarian’s eye behind the lens, I make art from the real. Having seen 30+ countries and indulged in every experience you can think of - I bring a global perspective and a personal touch to every film. This isn’t just a highlight reel. It’s your story - the way it really felt.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Alex was amazing for our San Francisco wedding! He captured everything from our hotel prep to the last dance at the reception. He handled all three locations like a pro - especially the gorgeous outdoor space and ballroom at the Conservatory at One Sansome. He got along great with our big wedding party (no small feat!) and stayed cool and friendly all day. Communication was on point before, during, and after the wedding, and he rolled with any changes without missing a beat. His technical abilities truly impressed us. The steady-cam footage was smooth and professional, while the drone shots added a stunning cinematic quality. We're obsessed with both our full wedding video and the shorter cut he made for social media. When I asked for a few tweaks, Alex jumped right on them with zero drama. What makes Alex special is how much he genuinely cares about getting your vision just right. If you want someone who's talented, easy to work with, and passionate about making your wedding video perfect - Alex is your guy! Highly recommend!”Leah H., 9 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/8eb38db8-eaf4-44a2-9d16-3bbb21e2b5ac?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-videographers/fern-film)

They were incredibly kind, helpful, and easy to work with throughout the entire process. Our engagement photos and video were turned around so quickly, within about a week, which was such a nice surprise. Our wedding photos took a bit longer, but it was more than worth the wait. We received over 900 stunning photos along with a 10-minute wedding video, and the quality and editing were absolutely beautiful. The photos are so timeless, truly captured our day perfectly, and we are absolutely obsessed with them. We look at them all the time!! Every image felt thoughtful and beautifully done, and they truly captured the best memories from our day. They were also extremely flexible and accommodating since we were planning from out of state, which made everything feel seamless and stress-free.

You can tell that they put effort and truly care about capturing the couple's personality and presenting their unique love story. We were so impressed that we booked them before we had a venue, to make sure we had them locked in. We could not be more pleased with our experience working with Memory Lane. They went above and beyond to help us create our dream wedding. They have been in the business for quite a while and openly shared their contacts with us which were instrumental in helping us book our wedding planner and venue. John was very responsive all throughout the process. We chose the 7-hour package which seems like a long time but goes by quickly. We also got the drone for areal shots since our wedding was outdoors. They were really able to capture the night and it was completely worth it. Since Memory Lane was with us almost all night, we were able to forgo having a photographer for the reception. On the day of our wedding, John and his team of videographers made us feel comfortable and at ease, they were early and very organized. All in all our experience with Memory Lane has been exceptional, they were kind, professional, and worth every penny.
