  * ### The Photography of our Dreams!! 

•Verified review

•Callie S + J.•Oct 29, 2025

How do we even begin to explain how much we love Rhode Tripper Photography? If you’re reading this while considering booking them for your wedding - FULL STOP, JUST DO IT. Meaghan and Evan are two of the most lovely people we have met. Once we had our wedding date, they were the first vendor that we booked for our big day. From the very first meeting, we felt completely at ease talking to them about our vision, our budget, and what we wanted the day to feel like. They are super well connected in the wedding industry, and had lots of recommendations for other vendors when we felt overwhelmed. Initially we opted to skip an engagement shoot, but ended up reaching out to book one so that we’d have a little practice posing. It felt right for us as it gave us a chance to meet Meaghan and Evan and see how we felt behind the camera. They made us feel comfortable right from the start, and while we initially booked it just for practice, we were stunned by how beautiful the photographs came out. We knew immediately we’d made the right choice in booking Rhode Tripper Photography and ended up extending our wedding day coverage. We just couldn’t get enough of their gorgeous style and eye for detail. Leading up to the wedding, Meaghan and Evan were available for all of our questions and planning details. Meaghan ended up assembling a wedding timeline that even our event planners were blown away by. You can tell she knows what she’s doing (spoiler - the timeline was perfect down to the minute). On the day of the wedding, we felt completely relaxed and honestly just giddy to be around Meaghan and Evan. They brought such a fun and light energy to our day and blended in seamlessly with our friends and family. When we needed a leader in the chaos, they were there to make announcements and call people to step up for photos and stay on track. When we were on the dance floor, they blended in like they were lifelong friends dancing with all of us. When pollen from my flowers stained my dress, Meaghan had a Shout wipe ready - and did you know that Shout wipes work way better on a wedding dress than a Tide pen? MEAGHAN KNEW. We could truly go on forever about how much we love Rhode Tripper Photography, but we’ll let their gorgeous photos speak for themselves. We were delighted to get a stack of beautiful Polaroids at the end of the night, a stunning sneak peek the next day, and we can’t wait to see the way they captured the rest of the day. We’ll be gushing about them forever to everyone we know!!

Rhode Tripper Photography was one of the best decisions we made for our wedding. Meagan and Evan were awesome to work with- super supportive, fun, and really helped keep us calm. Meagan knows the wedding world inside and out and gave us such good advice along the way. She even taught me how to bustle my dress when I was fumbling with it, and they brought AMAZING energy to the dance floor / party that I am sure contributed to all the great shots they got. In full transparency, their price point was a little above what we had budgeted for photography, but in this case "you get what you pay for" came true. If you are on the fence about spending the money, it is so worth it- we'd make the same choice again in a second. They are worth every penny; the photos are gorgeous and capture everything from the big moments to the little ones we didn't even realize were happening. We couldn't be happier.

  * ### Forever grateful for Meaghan and Evan!!!

•Verified review

•Annie R.•Aug 2, 2025

TLDR: Working with Meaghan and Evan was one of the best decisions we made for our wedding. They made us feel completely at ease and gave us the most stunning photos of us and our favorite people. We’re forever grateful!!!! If you want more details: We feel so lucky to have had Meaghan and Evan as our wedding photographers. As two women getting married, we were especially excited (and a little nervous) to find someone who would make us feel comfortable, seen, and celebrated. From our first inquiry through our engagement session, the prep meetings, and the wedding day itself, Meaghan and Evan made the entire process easy, thoughtful, and genuinely fun. Neither of us had ever taken professional photos before and we came into it nervous a bit unsure of how we'd feel in front of the camera. But working with Meaghan and Evan put us completely at ease. They made us laugh, gave just the right amount of guidance, and let us be ourselves. And in the middle of all of that, they captured absolutely stunning photos. The engagement AND wedding galleries brought us so much joy, not only because the images were beautiful, but because they *felt* like us. On the wedding day, everything was seamless. Meaghan and Evan kept the flow moving without it ever feeling rushed or overly posed. They captured all the big moments perfectly, but what surprised us most was how many of our favorite images came from the small, in-between moments. They captured the glances, the reactions, and the way we and our people move through a day together. So many of our friends and family showed up in the photos with amazing main character energy, and it’s incredible to see our loved ones celebrated in that way too. One of the things we appreciated most was how intentional Meaghan and Evan were about capturing the people who mean the most to us and the way we interact with them. It’s rare to get that kind of care and attention, and we’re so grateful for it. Our guests even commented afterward on how awesome and kind our photographers were. Meaghan and Evan became part of the joy of the day - not just people documenting it. If you’re on the fence about who to hire, especially if you’re looking for someone who’s affirming, thoughtful, easy to be around, and *really* talented - go with Meaghan. We’re so glad we did.

  * ### Magical Halloween Wedding

•Verified review

•Caitlin•Dec 13, 2024

Meaghan and Evan photographed our Halloween wedding and we couldn't imagine having anyone else! We met Meaghan and Evan last October when they shot our engagement photos. They were more than willing to trudge through our favorite park and stop at all our favorite spots to get some beautiful photos we used for our save the date. We got to get to know them a little more over at our favorite little ramen restaurant after the session and of course we were instantly sold! Meaghan was super communicative and responded to every email I sent her pretty much right away every single time. As we got closer to the wedding day, she sent an incredibly detailed questionnaire. It covered everything from our most important shots to what weird family dynamics she should be conscious of; we sincerely appreciated this level of care, especially as a queer couple with some iffy family things. When I was hiring vendors, it was extremely important to me to find vendors who were queer/queer friendly and body positive, and Meaghan checked off both boxes in spades. My wife and I both have huge body insecurities and are deeply self-conscious of photos-but Meaghan made us both feel so beautiful. I was never even aware of the parts of myself I am usually hyper aware of because Meaghan and Evan both made us feel so comfortable. We were able to laugh and feel every emotion without once worrying about how we would look in the photos. On the day of, Meaghan kept us right on track without rushing us or making us feel stressed. We were definitely running behind at points but Meaghan handled it all with grace and helped me keep my head above water the whole time. They captured every moment in such a storybook way that we are able to talk about and remember every detail of the day based on the photos. This gallery is such a keepsake and such a special reminder of the best day of our lives. Its so heartwarming to look back and see how happy we and our guests look. And my wife and I both couldn’t have asked for more stunning photos of ourselves. We both look and feel so feminine, so whimsical, so magical. She captured our authentic selves, which is what makes her photos so unique and beautiful. I can't wait to order our prints and have these photos in our home forever! Thank you, Meaghan and Evan. There's so much more I could say but I'll leave off with, we are so grateful to have had you on our day. We love our photos so much. And we can't wait to have you do another shoot for us sometime in the near future! We cannot recommend you highly enough!

## Frequently asked questions

2 Answers

Ask them a question

### How many pictures will we get?

I guarantee 75 per hour of shooting, but it’s usually closer to 100 per hour. The final amount depends on the number of contracted hours and overall timeline of the day (which I will help create!)

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

The day after your wedding, I will send you a sneak peek with about 10 edited photos. Within 6 weeks after your wedding you will receive the entire edited gallery online with options to share with your loved ones and download in either web-sized or full high resolution. From there, you’ll be able to post to social media, purchase prints and albums!
