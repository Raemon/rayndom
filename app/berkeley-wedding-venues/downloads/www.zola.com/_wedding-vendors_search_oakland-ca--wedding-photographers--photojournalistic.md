We offer engagement photography, wedding photos, highlight films, wedding coverage and more.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Sound Originals was beyond incredible for my wedding. I communicated to them that I wanted to add video a few months out from my wedding and it was a stress free process. My husband and I are a bit awkward when taking photos and my photographer and videographer were so great in helping us get comfortable and trying different poses that made us less awkward in front of the camera. They both helped keep the energy high all throughout the night and my only regret was not hiring them for longer to capture things that had happened after they left. My bridal party and guests were telling me how great my photographer and videographer were. I just got my photos back and they are exactly what I wanted; Moody, slightly editorial with some candid moments. I can’t recommend Sound Originals enough and I will be recommending them to friends and family that are in need of a photographer/videographer”Hannah R., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/bb98a4c5-9a9a-4e14-b038-50702d371f0d?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/sound-originals-photo-video)

I am an elopement and wedding photographer based in Northern California, who shoots for the fun quirky weirdos who are unabashedly themselves. I capture the perfection that you are while having a laugh and (almost assuredly) crying along while you read your vows. My name is Katelyn and I want to meet you!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Katelyn is a dream come true as a wedding photographer.

I’m Cherlyn (rhymes with Berlin). So nice to e-meet you! If we met in person and it wasn’t during a pandemic- I would probably hug you! I’m an introvert-extrovert and tend to ramble too much when I get nervous. In emails - I tend to use exclamation points a lot!! (and will agonize over my drafts of emails before sending them because they probably have one too many!!) My aim as your photographer is to provide a memorable experience where you two feel comfortable, taken care of, and get to fully enjoy your wedding day as much as possible with all your guests & loved ones - whether they be in real life or via livestream!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Cherlyn captured our elopement in November 2024 at Timber Cove Inn. Since this was a second wedding for both of us, and was very small (just us and our kids) we wanted to keep things simple, focusing on the beauty of the landscape with a simple, sweet ceremony. Cherlyn absolutely nailed it - she captured the vibe we were going for perfectly and the photos are absolutely stunning! I could not be happier with the photos and the experience as a whole. She made us so comfortable and that led to great photos where we look at ease, which is just how we felt.”Kristin B., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/7893b11a-df00-49c4-ad9d-636b8388d7cc?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/c-wagner-photography-design-llc)

Amanda Goldsmith Photography 5.0 Oakland, CA

  * Photojournalistic style
  * Starts at $4,000 

I’ve been photographing weddings for five years, mostly on film. My background in art, landscape architecture, and graphic design shapes how I approach photographing weddings, from light and composition to the details that make each wedding unique. For me, wedding photography is about being present and noticing fleeting, meaningful, and joyful moments as well as the elements that give your day its character. I move through the day with curiosity, joy, and care, letting it unfold naturally so the images feel soulful, expressive, and alive.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“From the moment we first spoke with Amanda, her relaxed, funny, and warm personality instantly put us at ease. She is the perfect blend of professional and personable - Amanda fit right in with our friends and family on the wedding day, and somehow was everywhere at once to capture all the little moments we didn't even get to see. She is pure magic when it comes to capturing candid moments. The photos she delivered are truly artful, timeless, and beautifully document our special day. We couldn't be happier with our wedding photos, and highly recommend Amanda to any couple looking for a talented, personable wedding photographer who uses film as a main tool of documentation.”Chelsea, 3 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/amanda-goldsmith-photography)

Want a trusted, unobtrusive, thoughtful pro photographer friend on your wedding day? Someone to capture the way the wedding FEELS as well as it looks. A little direction during portrait time, a little leadership during family portraits, and near invisibility all other times? I think you’re onto something. I’m in. What's exciting? What’s important? What's confusing? Let’s sit down for a discovery meeting and I’ll ask, listen, lay out options, and share suggestions. I want to learn about you. I'm on your team 100% before, during, and after your wedding. Bonus: I've shot 400+ practice weddings before yours and I absolutely LOVE what I do!“Olivia was incredible!!! The preparation leading up to our wedding was so easy and Olivia really took the time to get to know us and learn what moments we didn’t want her to miss during our wedding. We didn’t need to worry about a thing on our big day. She was very organized and allowed me and Josh to enjoy the day with full confidence she was snapping all the right pics! We also got them back in record time! Only two weeks after the wedding! We would highly recommend Olivia if you are looking for a photographer who is professional, fun, easy going and super talented!”Christina & J., 4 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/olivia-smartt-photography)

  * Serves Oakland, CA

Hi, I'm Christina Hernandez, and I am passionate about emotional, documentary photography. After working 15 years as a staff photojournalist at the San Francisco Chronicle, I've taken my years of experience to create rich, memorable images for my couples. My goal is to create a photo gallery that tells YOUR story. You are unique and your images should be, too. I cry at weddings. I can't help it! I get emotionally invested and I won't apologize for it. It allows me to get into the zone where I am completely immersed in the moment and I strive to make images that reflect that. I love being inspired by new locations, and I go with the flow.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“I love working with Christina from Nightingale! She is fun, knowledgeable, very understanding of ones vision and overall talented. I highly recommend her!”Diana Dorsey, 5 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/nightingale-photography)

I'm Hannah, a full time wedding and portrait photographer in Livermore, California. To me, photography is so much more than just hiring another vendor. And that's why you should choose someone you truly love to work with! I believe the real magic happens during the in-between moments – a secret smile shared by the parents; a tearful hug with the maid of honor; a quirky moment with the best man. These memories are far more precious than any staged photo, and these are the memories I want to capture for you on your big day.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“What can I say about Hannah!

After our first conversation with her, it was obvious we wanted her to capture our wedding. Not only are her photos beautiful, she has the energy and attitude of someone you would want at your wedding. You feel an instant calmness in her presence. She is a true artist at heart, and our wedding photos are beyond what we could have asked for or expected.

Hi, I’m Hayden! With over 300 weddings captured, I take a journalistic approach to photography, documenting authentic moments as they naturally unfold. I shoot with both film and digital to create timeless, heartfelt images that tell your unique love story. With a go-with-the-flow mentality, I will capture moments as they come and turn them into beautiful memories.“Hayden was absolutely fantastic! Not only did he bring his own camera and film to contribute to the retro vibe of our wedding (photo attached), he worked perfectly with our friend and videographer to get some incredible shots of my wife and I. His demeanor and humor made it so much easier and more fun to take photos and really set us at ease. He posed us in such a natural way that didn’t feel awkward at all and the photos were absolutely stunning. To top it all off, he saw my groomsmen and I setting up chairs for the ceremony and he pitched in to help us carry them!

Hey you! I’m Danielle Michelle! I am very passionate about not only delivering photos both bride and groom will adore but as well as friends and family for generations to come, Planning a wedding can be very stressful but working with your photographer should not be. I will be with you guys throughout the whole process making it as enjoyable as possible. I make sure every couple I work with feels beautiful and comfortable in front of the camera and leaves the experience feeling amazing. I would absolutely love to be part of your entire process from overall planning to execution of the day! Let’s chat about your big day and make some magic!“From our first call with Danielle all the way back in April 2023, we knew she would be an amazing person to work with! Her eye for the perfect shot, her ability to make you feel at ease and just take in the moment was exactly what we needed for our engagement shoot & our wedding. Her editing made our day look even more magical to look back on, and she truly captured the day in every way possible. The emotions of it all, all the details we put together, and truly made us be able to be immersed straight back to how we all felt on that day. Our families love working with her & had nothing but amazing things to say about her & her second shooter for the day, and our vendors loved them as well! We cannot thank you enough, Danielle, for how much you have given us with your talent & dedication to our wedding journey! If you can get her available, BOOK HER! You won’t regret it!”Madison C., 7 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/1b46a9b3-55aa-4126-b4df-29f8a6291335?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/danielle-michelle-photography)

Hello! I'm Varun, a photographer with a passion for turning fleeting moments into lasting memories. My photography goes beyond just capturing a scene - I strive to tell a story through my lens, one that evokes emotions and brings your vision to life. I have been covering weddings throughout the Bay Area for over a decade and have only had 5 Star Reviews. Check me out on Yelp!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We couldn’t be happier with our experience working with Varun as our wedding photographer! From the moment we first connected, he was warm, professional, and genuinely invested in capturing our story. On the wedding day, he made us feel so comfortable in front of the camera and somehow managed to be everywhere at once without ever being intrusive. The photos are simply stunning — emotional, artistic, and full of life. He beautifully captured all the big moments, like our first look and the ceremony, as well as the smaller candid moments that we’ll treasure forever. His eye for detail and composition is incredible, and he truly brought out the beauty of our venue and the joy of the day. We’ve gotten so many compliments from friends and family about our photos, and we honestly can’t stop looking at them. If you're looking for someone who is not just a talented photographer but also kind, calming, and incredibly easy to work with, we highly recommend Varun. Check out his work at sfweddingphotos.com — you’ll see exactly what we mean!”Jackie A., 8 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/e237605e-9121-4a9c-b083-d5a9d8591a70?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/sf-wedding-photos)

Hey, I'm Marisa! I work with couples to help capture their dream wedding day! Most days you can find me drinking coffee in front of my computer editing the day away. If I’m not home in the SF Bay Area, I’m most likely in the Sierras or at a session off the grid. Outdoor adventures light up my soul! I basically live out of a duffle bag. In my free time you can find me drinking wine with friends, maybe on a run, laying around with my dog, near a lake or finding the best tacos.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We could not imagine working with any other photographer for our wedding! From our first video meeting to touch base, to our engagement shoot, and ultimately our wedding day, Marisa collaborated with us and other vendors with so much grace and a great sense of humor. She communicates clearly and punctually. We were particularly impressed with how she was able to wrangle our large families and get group photos together with confidence, but also captured the small, intimate moments so perfectly. We will forever cherish the photos that perfectly encapsulate the best day of our lives. Thank you so much, Marisa!”Jocelyn, a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/47e0aae1-e9b4-4825-a6f0-b19b3f1c036b?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/marisa-ruth-photography)

We are visual storytellers with nearly two decades of experience who focus on organic moments while highlighting a sense of space and showcasing your beloved communities authentically. For the introverted camera shy, your comfort is our priority before we even start shooting. We photograph discreetly with an emphasis on candids so from the moment you first see each other to that last sweaty song on the dancefloor, you’ll be relaxed and focused on one another and won’t even notice we’re there.“I highly recommend working with Vivian Chen and her associate photographer Erin Prado for your wedding! Both of them were wonderful from start to finish and our photographs came out gorgeous. I really wanted a photographer with a natural look (not the overly bright/blown out look you so often get in wedding photos) and a focus on candids, and they came out just as fantastic as I expected from looking through their portfolios. We worked with Erin for a mini engagement session and our wedding and she was lovely on both days - really relaxed and personable while still giving us great direction on poses and positioning. Small things so we were still moving naturally and acting like ourselves, but really helpful (ie: having my husband put his hand in his pocket, reminding me to hold my bouquet lower). She also did lots of candid-style/natural positioning, like having us look at each, talk, laugh, walk, etc… and all of those are my favorite shots. She’s also just really nice, professional, and respectful - we did private vows and she gave us some space for privacy while still getting some lovely shots of it. The final edits done by Vivian came out beautifully, her style feels very cinematic and I love it! She also turned them around much faster than I expected, we got teasers 4 days after our wedding, and the full gallery of over 850 photos in just two weeks! She advised us to expect 4-6 weeks so that was a lovely surprise (probably helped by our wedding being a bit before busy season). I’d absolutely recommend them both to anyone!”Christina B., 9 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/eb6e7af2-68fc-45cb-aa1f-ebaa38bce963?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/vivian-chen-photography)

I’m a photographer based in San Francisco, California. Pero, I travel anywhere in the world for destination weddings and elopements. I was born in Manila and at a young age I developed my love for photography watching films. I just had this feeling that I wanted to freeze time and hold on to moments. Besides my passion for photography, I’m an avid traveler and have a love for food! So, let’s get to know each other more and tell me your love story! I’m up for some good ramen and delicious ube desserts.“Janvier Photography was an absolute dream to work with for our special day. From the very beginning, his communication style was assertive, analytical, and professional, yet he was also incredibly kind and encouraging throughout the entire process. His passion, talent, and dedication to his craft was evident in the stunning, high-quality photos he delivered that truly captured the special moments of our big day. Janvier made me and my partner feel so comfortable and at ease during the shoot, keeping us laughing and helping us achieve natural, beautiful poses. He went above and beyond to ensure we got the photos of our dreams, and we would recommend them to anyone looking for an excellent wedding photographer. The photos we have will last us a lifetime, and we are forever grateful to Janvier Photography for their incredible work.”Kayla f., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/32a7ddf5-baf3-44f5-8e29-8123fa467d1c?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/janvier-photography)

Wanderlust and a social curiosity led me to study photojournalism in the American West where I fell in love with people and places; everything from the way we live and work, build and break, love and pray. Here's to you!“Luke George Photography was an absolute pleasure to work with for our wedding day. From our initial consultation, Luke and his was warm, flexible, and incredibly supportive - taking the stress out of the photography process so we could simply enjoy the day. Their work is truly stunning, with a uniquely fun and creative style that captured all the special moments in a way that feels both timeless and fresh. The aerial shots and wedding video they provided were incredible additions that we'll cherish forever. We loved working with Luke and his team, and cannot recommend them highly enough.”Amy S., a year ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/luke-george-photography)

Foot Candles Photography 5.0

So, what are we about and how did we end up here? Well, for starters, we've been together for almost twenty years and continue to find ways to laugh with each other. (Yes, 20 years!) Being a kid at heart will do that to you. Not to mention, being responsible for #hellakids will do that to you as well. With four kids in tow, it's never a dull moment in the Kenoly household to say the least!“Madelynn and Amari are an absolute joy to work with. Not only is their work absolutely stunning, but they are also just such fun, friendly, and professional people. Their love for each other and the warmth and love they extend to others makes all the difference. We’re pretty camera shy, but Madelynn and Amari made us feel so comfortable and just blended into our wedding party as if they were our guests. They were also flexible around timing, hours, and budgeting, which was a huge help for us. The end result was also incredible. They captured both posed and candid moments from our wedding weekend — as well as the beautiful scenery around us — with class, warmth, and beauty. Just absolutely gorgeous and not at all cliche like many other wedding photographers. Thank you again, Mad and Amari, for doing such an incredible job and really feeling like a partner throughout the process together!”Lara A., 6 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/foot-candles-photography)

[ I do not respond to inquiries here. Please submit an inquiry on my website. ] You can expect sun, sand, and redwoods. Documenting memories for the happiest, wildest, can't-stop-smiling kind of love in California and beyond. For souls who seek to feel the ocean's breeze, are not afraid to get a little messy, souls who want to dance with the wind in their hair, and celebrate memories in the making. Let's adventure together!“Kendall was an absolute joy to work with for our wedding photography. Her communication style is quick, thorough, kind and friendly, which put us at ease through the entire process. The quality of Kendall's work is excellent and impressive - we feel we got great value for beautiful photos that captured the essence of our special day. Kendall made us and our guests feel so comfortable from start to finish. She arrived early to scout locations and stayed late into the evening to get candid shots of the dance floor. We highly recommend Kendall Aubrey Photography for your wedding or special event!”Arden K., 2 years ago![](https://images.zola.com/9f7b1e16-92cc-4042-8909-99deb8306d33?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/kendall-aubrey)
