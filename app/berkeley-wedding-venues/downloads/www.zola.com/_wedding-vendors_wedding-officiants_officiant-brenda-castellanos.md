## About Officiant Brenda Castellanos

Get a quote

I have been an Ordained Minister since 2003. My ministry is non-denominational, and I specialize in officiating marriage ceremonies. My goal is to make your ceremony a memorable one and to be a part of your beautiful event. I provide you with a "Menu" book of different ceremonies for you to choose from.

It's your special day, and the ceremony should be your way! I am available for your rehearsal, if needed. I am bilingual, English/Spanish. I travel 40 miles at no extra charge. Congratulations, and I look for to working with both of you! Thank you!
