![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“I would recommend Eagle Ridge to anyone over and over and over again. They set the bar so freakin’ high for what a planning team, event team and venue should be for weddings. The staff are incredible. Big shout outs to Priscilla, Jennifer, Casey, Kelly and Xochi. The process from beginning to end was enjoyable and memorable, all because of the staff. Special thanks to Jennifer, Priscilla and Casey for being so attentive and responsive to us during the planning process. The food is so GOOD!! Weddings are always hit or miss when it comes to food, but Eagle Ridge kitchen really delivered! Eagle Ridge had that vintage, warm, romantic feel that we were looking for. It was hard to envision as we were going in for meetings what it would be like on a wedding night, but the photos they gave us provided a really good example of what things COULD look like, and the venue far exceeded our expectations on the day of. The ceremony space was beautiful, and didn’t need too much to spruce it up. The venue itself is filled with many photo op worthy places for photographers and guests alike, and I love that the bar is built in. The way that Eagle Ridge is described on the Wedgewood site is 100% accurate to what it feels like on your wedding day. Everything about this day was perfect. We opted out of draping and any arbor draping for the ceremony space because we knew we had chosen a space that was just architecturally beautiful as it is. It’s not often that you can just walk into a venue and be like “yeah, it’s actually so beautiful just the way it is.” I had printed guides for how to set things up, but for the most part, I just gave high level instructions and told Kelly (our day of coordinator, who was just so incredible btw!!) that I trusted her and her team to set things up the way they felt it fit best. I left some extra decoration items as well, and said they were optional to use if they wanted to. The biggest thing I left up to her and the teams discretion was our arch. We made the floral sprays for it but didn't know what to do with the draping. Let me just say, I was so unbelievably impressed with how everything turned out. Kelly and the team that set up our wedding absolutely KILLED it!!! Everything was so beautifully set up, the arch was better than I could have done myself, the ceremony space was so beautiful, and all the signage was set up perfectly. As a Type-A personality, it felt hard to relinquish control over the small details, but the Eagle Ridge team made me feel comfortable and I didn’t think twice about it. They most certainly delivered! Our Banquet Captain Xochi also was a total boss!! She made sure the night ran smoothly and I never found myself looking for her, she was always close by if I needed her help on something. The night went off without a hitch because of Xochi and her attentiveness! I’ll say it again, yes the building and the venue itself is beautiful, but it’s the team that truly makes the experience what it is. If you want to feel taken care of, seen, heard and like you can trust people the moment you go hands off, Eagle Ridge is it. I will be replaying this day over and over and over again in my head for as long as I live, and it’s all thanks to the work that the team that helped us through it all put into it.”Nichelle P., 4 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/acc6873e-e12e-4b3a-9871-6904aa067ef3?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/eagle-ridge-by-wedgewood-weddings)

From the moment we first reached out, the team - especially Lindsey and Abbie - were incredibly responsive, quick to help, and went above and beyond to make our day magical. The venue itself is truly stunning, with beautiful grounds and an amazing crew that handled any issues we had with such care and ease.

Desde el primer día que fuimos a conocer las instalaciones, el señor Gary fue muy atento y respetuoso, contestó a todas nuestras dudas. Tal vez nuestro evento fue algo fuera de lo común, a diferencia de los eventos de boda que se organizan aquí, nosotros contratamos el granero para el 25 de Diciembre para celebrar los 15 años de mi hija , sabemos que son días festivos donde la gente está con su familia , más sin embargo recibimos todo su apoyo para que el evento se hiciera realidad en este día tan especial , puedo decirles que fue una experiencia maravillosa, fue en evento de ensueño y de igual manera nos hospedamos en la casa, donde realmente nos sentimos como en nuestro hogar , sinceramente todas las instalaciones estuvieron limpias en todo momento, Gary estuvo al pendiente de si necesitábamos algo y al igual si la empresa que contratamos para la planeación necesitaban apoyo. Quiero animar a todos los papás que deseen hacerle su quinceañera a su hija, que consideren contratar los servicios de Suisun Valley Inn, ya que harán que su hija viva una experiencia única y de ensueño, no se arrepentirán. Sr Gary agradezco todas sus atenciones y muy pronto estaremos trabajando con usted para los 15 años de mi otra hija… Bendiciones”Fabiola M., 22 days ago![](https://images.zola.com/0dbc73ce-706c-4f4e-8b41-7324823426c8?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/suisun-valley-inn-at-monroe-ranch)

“We hosted our October 2023 Wedding Reception at The Tech Interactive and I highly recommend it to anybody who is looking for a unique (and literally interactive) venue. It was so much fun and our guests had a great time! We rented the entire lower level and they kept the galleries and exhibits open so our guests could play with them throughout the night! They were a hit during cocktail hour as well as for taking breaks from the dance floor (although we still always had plenty of people on the dance floor!) Our event was mostly adults with a handful of younger relatives, and everyone had a great time. The exhibits at The Tech Interactive are perfect for quick and fun interactions no matter how interested (or not interested) any individual guest was in science/technology. Our engineer friends had a great time with the Cyber Detectives activities, while even our least technically-inclined guests enjoyed playing around with things like the Jet Pack Chair and Solve For Earth. This was truly best of both worlds, as we didn't have to give up any of the "traditional" wedding elements to make room for the fun of the exhibits - our tables and decorations were set up beautifully, we still had appetizers and an open bar, and like I mentioned above, there were still always plenty of people on the dance floor! We actually didn't even need to decorate as much as we might have with a more "traditional" venue either, as the existing colors, lighting, and layout of The Tech make for a strong baseline to build from. Our primary contact was Lolita and she was extremely helpful and pleasant to work with. She was there with us every step of the way, from our initial tour to our reception itself. She made sure to consider exactly what we were looking for to make our wedding special and was extremely organized and great and communicating with us as well as our other vendors. She created a great layout based on our table count, dance floor size, and the space the caterer needed, and she and her team went above and beyond and worked with our caterer and coordinator to help set everything up between the public close time and the start of our event so that everything was perfect when our guests got there. They even let us customize the exterior lighting color of the building during our event. The physical location of The Tech Interactive is fantastic as well - right in downtown San Jose within walking distance of tons of hotels and two parking garages where The Tech validates. The city closed off Market Street right in front of The Tech relatively last minute for a public city event, but Lolita was on top of it and worked with us and our shuttle company to arrange for pickup and a smooth experience for our guests. In summary: If you're looking to do something unique with your wedding or event, I can't recommend The Tech Interactive enough. Lolita was fantastic to work with and our guests couldn't stop saying how it was one of the most fun weddings they had ever been to.”Steve W., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-tech-interactive)
