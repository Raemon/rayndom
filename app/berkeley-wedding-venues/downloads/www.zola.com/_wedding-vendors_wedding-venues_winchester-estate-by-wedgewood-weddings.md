  * ### Most Perfect Day! 

•Verified review

•Jennifer M.•Jan 12

Our wedding at Winchester Estate on January 2, 2026 was an absolute dream and truly a perfect day. Everything went so smoothly from start to finish, which allowed us to fully enjoy every moment without stress. The venue itself is absolutely stunning, pictures don’t even do it justice. Our guests couldn’t stop complimenting how beautiful the estate was, and the food was excellent, exceeding all expectations. I honestly could not have planned a better day or a more seamlessly organized event. Wedgewood made the entire planning process so easy and stress-free. Our coordinator, and the entire day-of staff were wonderful, professional, kind, attentive, and truly on top of everything. I couldn’t have imagined a better wedding day, and I’m so grateful to the Winchester Estate and Wedgewood team for making it so perfect. Highly recommend to any couple looking for a beautiful venue and an effortless planning experience.

  * ### Wedding Masterpiece 

•Verified review

•Robin K.•Nov 6, 2025

We were told by all our guests it was the most beautiful and fun wedding they had ever been to. We agree! It was breathtaking and perfect in every way. We are so grateful. The professionalism was off the charts and we were cared for right up until the last minute at the end of the night. Thank you Winchester by Wedgewood!

  * ### Like a fairytale

•Verified review

•Kat P.•Nov 5, 2025

The Winchester Estate by Wedgewood Weddings was an absolute dream come true! From the moment we stepped onto the property, we knew it was the perfect place for our fairytale wedding. The ivy-covered walls, romantic ambiance, and stunning grounds made us feel like we were living inside a storybook. Every detail was beyond what we imagined. Taylor, our coordinator, was incredible from the very start. She kept in constant contact, answered every question, and somehow managed to think of things we didn’t even know we needed. She made us feel so heard and cared for every step of the way, and she even ensured that allergies and personal preferences were handled thoughtfully and seamlessly. When Ben took over on the day of the wedding, everything flowed effortlessly. He kept the timeline running smoothly while making sure we could just enjoy the moment. And then there was Drew — our amazing DJ — who truly brought the party to life. He made our music feel personal, got everyone dancing, and even joined in on the fun himself! He somehow managed to keep the little ones entertained (and contained!) when their lightsaber battle got a bit too enthusiastic — a true hero of the night! The entire staff went above and beyond, dancing along with us, smiling, and adding to the energy of the celebration. It never felt like they were just working an event — they were part of it. Their joy matched ours, and that made the night even more unforgettable. Our wedding at Winchester Estate was everything we dreamed of and more. It was magical, effortless, and filled with love and laughter. We’ll cherish it forever!

  * ### The best day ever!

•Verified review

•Blake H.•May 1, 2025

This was the most amazing & perfect day for us! We are still reliving this day & so happy with how everything turned out. Not only is Winchester CC so beautiful & breathtaking, it’s the perfect venue for us golf lovers as well! My parents went to look at the venue before us without an appointment and the WW team toured them around as if they had one! Amazing customer service! We were sold on the venue right after we toured it & put a deposit down right away! All of the girls are so professional & really want to make your dream wedding come true! I highly recommend attending one of their wedding faires as it’s a great time to speak with your other vendors, see what additional add-ons there might be & even win a raffle prize like us!! The service was amazing from the very beginning to the end. They even allowed us to bring an ice sculpture that was a wedding present to us, they never have dealt with one before but were totally open and willing! Taylor our Coordinator was the best! She rocked it!! She knew we wanted an outdoor wedding, the rain stopped 40 minutes before our ceremony and she was wiping each chair down from the rain. Kayla was great too, making sure we had everything and was comfortable the whole night! I cant recommend WW enough, honestly wedding of our dreams!! We have had many people say it was the best wedding they have ever been to!!
