I have been a Zen Priest since 2009, and have been officiating weddings since 2011. To everything I do I bring fifteen years of residential zen training at San Francisco Zen Center, including five years of intense monastic training at Tassajara, and many silent retreats. As a wedding officiant I am proud to have performed many same-sex marriages, and many of the couples I have married have been multi-cultural. I am often asked to wear my Buddhist robes for the ceremony, but that is entirely up to the couple. Ceremonies have ranged in size from the couple, me and the photographer, to much more formal settings for up to two hundred people.

If you hire me, you will receive the benefits of my long years of meditation practice. My line is always that it is your day, and you are the people that need to be happy with how it unfolds. My meditation practice helps me remain grounded and present in these big moments, and that can help the couple to stay calmer as well. This is not my full-time job; I currently officiate about a dozen weddings a year. Your big day will be meaningful to me as well as you. I also have an English accent which some people find charming and authoritative.

**In three words:** Calm, Confident, Supportive

  * ### Best Wedding Officiant!

•Verified review

•Rachel N.•Dec 10, 2025

We are beyond thrilled with the wonderful experience we had with Shundo as our wedding officiant. Shundo radiated warmth, professionalism, and genuine care for our wedding. His attention to detail ensured that our ceremony was a true reflection of us as a couple. He took the time to get to know our love story, our values, and what was important to us to be said at the wedding. This personalized touch made our ceremony not only beautiful but also deeply meaningful. Throughout the planning process, Shundo was incredibly supportive. He offered guidance and suggestions, but always made sure that our vision and preferences took center stage. During the ceremony, Shundo's words were eloquent and heartfelt. Ourselves and our guests loved and were moved by the ceremony, and expressed how well done it was. We were incredibly grateful to have had Shundo as a part of our wedding, and we wholeheartedly recommend his services to anyone looking for an officiant who will make their day as magical as ours was!

  * ### Helpful and Happy Officiant :)

•Verified review

•Allison W.•Dec 5, 2025

As fellow meditators, it was a joy to have Shundo officiate our wedding. Shundo's communication style was clear, helpful, and timely throughout the process. He gladly scheduled Zoom calls to learn more about us and to guide us through the vows process (one that we were unknowledgeable about XD). He was also very flexible when we wanted to change how the ceremony was structured. Shundo's work was sincere, compassionate, happy, and joyful. We're grateful that Shundo traveled all the way from San Francisco to Saratoga for our wedding and also mailed in our marriage certificate. Shundo's warm smile and presence truly made our special day even more memorable. Thank you c: - Allie & Eric

  * ### Seamless and stress free officiant

•Verified review

•Ryan and K.•Dec 5, 2025

We couldn't have asked for a better officiant for our wedding day! From the very first meeting, Shundo made us feel at ease. The ceremony was beautifully delivered. He showed up early and made sure everything was in order. If you're looking for someone that will treat your wedding with the love and thoughtfulness it deserves, look no further.

## Frequently asked questions

7 Answers

Ask them a question

### How long have you been in business?

I started officiating weddings in 2011, a couple of years after I was ordained as a Zen Priest. At first these ceremonies were for friends and friends of friends, but for the past ten years I have performed weddings more widely.

### How many weddings have you done?

This is not my full-time job. I usually do about a dozen ceremonies a year, so each one is special and meaningful to me. If you add up fifteen years of that, at least a hundred, varying from the couple, the photographer and I on Baker Beach, to more formal weekend events with two hundred guests. I am new on Zola, having just listed on Thumbtack up until now.

### Can we personalize our ceremony?

This is your big day, so what I say during the ceremony should reflect who you are as a couple. I am happy to provide examples of previous ceremonies I have done that I think will best do that. Often couples don't know where to start, and this can help them find the right words. Generally, couples will pick and choose from these scripts, and write part of it themselves to make it more meaningful. We can collaborate on this until the day itself - I always say that as long as I can print out the document before I leave the house, I am fine with changes!

### Do you do rehearsals? Is that included in your cost?

I have attended rehearsals for the bigger ceremonies I have performed. Obviously travel costs and time for this would be added to my basic fee.

### We’re legally married already. Can you still do our ceremony?

Yes; sometimes people will have a legal ceremony and then a more celebratory occasion. I had this come up recently with a couple wanting to renew their vows after ten years of marriage. It is not possible to obtain a new license (even if the first wedding was in a different country as was the case here), but I am happy to perform this kind of ceremony.

### Do you provide or require premarital counseling?

Counseling is not a requirement for me, but it is necessary to speak with the couple to get a sense of who they are, and the kind of wedding they are planning. It also helps establish if we are a good fit for each other - the vibes must be right! I am also happy to offer spiritual guidance before and after marriage if asked.

### What is your background?

I grew up in England, and lived there until 2000, when I moved to San Francisco to begin Zen Practice. I have a nice, clear English accent, which some people find classy!
