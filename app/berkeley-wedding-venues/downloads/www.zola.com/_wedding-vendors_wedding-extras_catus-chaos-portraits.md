I’m a Portuguese visual artist who loves capturing people—their faces, stories, and fleeting moments. I create live portraits using oil pastels and ink on upcycled canvases, crafting expressive, intuitive works made in real time. My art celebrates connection, presence, and the beauty of the moment shared.

I create live portraits that capture the emotion and energy of your wedding in real time. Using bold and expressive strokes, I turn moments with your guests into meaningful keepsakes. More than entertainment, it’s a deeply personal experience—art born from connection, presence, and the beauty of your day.

**In three words:** Confident, Creative, Fun

  * ### Thank you! So lucky to have found her!

•Verified review

•Jessica M.•Dec 11, 2025

Catus Chaos Portraits was an incredible addition to our wedding day. Her communication beforehand was direct, organized, and attentive. During the cocktail hour and the reception, Cat was so fun and creative, going above and beyond to paint portraits for anyone who wanted one. Our guests all loved her! Her portraits are one-of-a-kind and she also captured multiple unplanned moments in her paintings that we will forever be grateful for. Her personality and paintings truly contributed to the overall wedding vibe. So glad she was a part of our day!

## Frequently asked questions

4 Answers

Ask them a question

### How many portraits will you create during the event?

It depends on the flow of the event and the number of guests, but on average I spend 10–15 minutes per portrait. This allows me to capture the personality and emotion of each subject in real time.

### Can guests request to be painted during the event?

Absolutely! Guests are welcome (and encouraged!) to sit for a portrait.

### What happens to the paintings after the wedding?

It depends on the bride and groom. The paintings can be displayed during the event, and afterward the couple can either keep them as personal keepsakes or gift them to guests as a memorable souvenir.

### Can you paint more than one person at a time?

No, each portrait is created individually to capture the personality, emotion, and unique details of each guest. This ensures every piece is expressive, personal, and full of character.
