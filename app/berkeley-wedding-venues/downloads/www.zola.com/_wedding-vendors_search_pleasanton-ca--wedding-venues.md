I had an art gallery show and celebration of living. The staff was quick to reply to my emails and generous with their support. The day of the art exhibit the staff was helpful and kind. They kept an eye on me better than my own family, bringing me food and drinks. The food was good and I had 7 passed appetizers and a prime rib carving station. I was so happy and impressed with my choice of venue.”Joy D., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/5cd1e0a9-22b6-42eb-b0c2-d1c2b4ad89b0?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/san-ramon-by-wedgewood-weddings)

The whole JSM team was so amazing to work with and made planning as stress-free as possible. We stuck to the planning timeline they provided in the planning binder (which was SO helpful to have) and had everything ready in time. Our guests all raved about what a fabulous wedding it was. We customized the venue quite a bit bringing in our own decor and personal touches and it did not feel cookie-cutter at all even though it is an all-inclusive venue. I am so happy we chose JSM!! The recommended vendors were all outstanding, the food was delicious, everything ran smoothly during the wedding and I didn't have to stress about a thing. The mansion, ceremony area, and reception tent are all BEAUTIFUL. I could not have asked for a more perfect day.”Alexandra H., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/1cb206fc-f347-4815-84a4-94dca8dc013d?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/jefferson-street-mansion-by-wedgewood-weddings)

“We loved working with our Hacienda De Las Flores team for our wedding! Johnny was our day of coordinator wand was wonderful. With our schedules being so busy we could not imagine planning this wedding without the WW team which for us took care of most things for us (food, decor, drinks, DJ). We appreciated the planning materials, binder, meetings which helped keep us on track. As my sister joked even if we did nothing, the wedding would still be great! We went with the recommended florist (A love is in bloom) and bakery (Old towne danville) and thought both were wonderful. We did chose our own Officiant and Photographer however. The venue is gorgeous and the weather thankfully cooperated for a beautiful early fall day. They were great about working with us and our decor ideas and playlist ideas. We loved our wedding! The only downside to be aware of is the noise ordinance which prevents use of microphones in the outdoor patio during reception (only pre-recorded sound/speech is ok). this was not ideal but we knew this was the case when we booked the venue because it is that gorgeous. We did speeches indoors in the dance hall which worked out fine though not ideal. We also had a tiny sound mishap during our grand entrance due to the pre-recorded nature of things but overall not a big deal. Overall think this venue is awesome and would recommend though of course depends on what's most important to you!”Vira F., 3 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/hacienda-de-las-flores-by-wedgewood-weddings)

Blue Agave Club is part of a family of great Mexican Restaurants located in the Bay Area. Located in the heart of downtown Pleasanton, Blue Agave Club first opened its doors in April, 1997. Being the very first restaurant in the area to debut high-end Mexican cuisine, it was clear there was something special about Blue Agave from the very beginning. Boasting an impressive list of premium tequila, BAC had a huge impact on our community by introducing the art of tequila tasting. It wasn’t long before we quickly became well known for our 100% Blue Agave Tequila margaritas, featuring a secret homemade sweet and sour recipe.Why you'll love this venue

From the moment we first reached out, Morgan Chandler and her team were friendly, responsive, and kind throughout the entire planning process. They went above and beyond to ensure our special day was gorgeous and professional in every way. When we encountered a few bumps along the way, they took care of it right away without any fuss. The staff at the venue was incredible as well! Setting up all of our decor, serving dinner and everything in between took so much stress off of my plate and I will always be so grateful! The venue itself was breathtaking, and our guests raved about the beautiful scenery and fantastic service.

## About wedding venues in Pleasanton, CA

### 

California offers an incredible 840 miles of coastline, 3,000+ wineries and ancient redwoods for your wedding day. When you choose the Golden State, you're getting exceptional natural lighting for your ceremony across diverse settings from Mediterranean coastal zones to alpine mountain backdrops. Each region has its own distinctive character that can perfectly match your vision.

### What Makes California Wedding Venues So Special?

Northern California's Napa Valley welcomes you with rolling vineyards and Spanish colonial architecture where intimate wine cave ceremonies create unforgettable moments. Head to Southern California and you'll find oceanfront venues like Duke's Malibu where you can exchange vows with the Pacific stretching out behind you while enjoying fresh coastal-inspired cuisine. Palm Springs offers dramatic desert venues with mountain backdrops and striking midcentury modern architecture that photographs beautifully.

### How Much Do Wedding Venues in California Cost?

Wedding venues in California typically run between $9,600 and $11,700 which aligns nicely with the national range of $6,500-$12,000. This represents about 18% of your total wedding budget. Your overall costs will vary based on guest count:

  * 50 guests: $26,190
  * 100 guests: $43,692
