What started with documenting trips and capturing everyday moments of my growing family slowly turned into a passion for visual storytelling. Whether it’s through photos or video, I’ve always felt a strong pull toward holding onto moments that otherwise pass too quickly. Being trusted to document such an important day is something I don’t take lightly. I love capturing the quiet glances, the happy tears, the deep laughs, and the moments that happen when no one is performing — just being.“Visuals by Chase was an exceptional choice for our wedding videography. From our very first interaction, his communication was clear, collaborative, and transparent, putting us at ease throughout the entire process.

Your loved ones will thank you for allowing your celebration to serve as a legacy of family history for generations to come.“https://vimeo.com/386274683 From the very beginning, booking and coordinating with our wedding videographers was simple and stress-free. They were incredibly prompt on the big day and kept everything moving smoothly without us ever feeling rushed. Their friendly, upbeat attitude made it easy to relax and enjoy every moment. Because they knew the layout of Stambaugh so well, they anticipated shots and transitions perfectly. That familiarity with the venue helped everything flow naturally throughout the day. They captured so many meaningful moments, both big and small, that we still cherish. Our wedding was documented beautifully and authentically. Even now, six years later, we find ourselves watching the footage on a regular basis. The video instantly brings us back to how that day felt.

We chatted on the phone to get to know him, sent him our deposit and that was that! We talked a bit leading up to the wedding, but he and my photographer communicated to get on the same page/ timeline so I didn’t have to stress much about that either. The day of, him and his team were wonderful all day. They themselves were professional, and all his gear was as well. One of the things I appreciated most about Colin was his ability to be everywhere to get footage, but he was secretive about it, so those that are shy on camera didn’t feel pressured. My videos I got were AMAZING. I don’t know how many times we have watched the videos together or how many I’ve watched it alone but, every time feels like the first. It’s beautiful work and truly captured our wedding day and our personalities. We also got raw footage from him that had us cackling.

To be completely honest, I was very hesitant on dropping a lot of money on just videography and wedding film at first. However, looking back, it was worth every cent and I have no regrets whatsoever. I definitely agree that people should spend more on videography rather than photography because it really did allow us to relive the moment and see other perspectives of the wedding day that we missed. Our wedding film would not have been possible without Jimmy and his team.

Oleg takes great detail to ensure the entire process is impressively seamless. Oleg made us feel incredibly comfortable and cared for in front of the camera. The communication was extremely clear, perfectly timed, collaborative, and just generally kind. Oleg’s passion and professional experience make him the ideal videographer- his instincts, ideas, and ability to discreetly capture every important moment make for the perfect final product. Oleg worked so well with our photo team too. I know that some people hesitate to have a videographer on their wedding day because they do not want to feel “filmed,” however I can assure you that you will never feel like that with Oleg. One of my friends even said at the end of the night that she was sad we didn’t have a videographer to capture the night and then I pointed to Oleg and she was blown away with how discrete his equipment and filming style was. I searched for months for a videographer that captured the whole ceremony, speeches, dances, and a heavy amount of highlights from the day. I found that most videographers offered extremely limited packages, restrictive time limits, and only very short videos for prices that were nowhere near realistic. Oleg is worth his weight in gold. He provides films that are short and sweet for social media or to show a friend, and then longer, detailed, movie like versions to relive your day and to show your future generations just how special every detail of you day was! His editing style speaks for itself- cinematic, timeless, high resolution, romantic, realistic- just perfect. The sneak peeks and full movie were sent back faster than I could have imagined. His data back up processes brought us peace of mind that our videos were safe! My cousin/bridesmaid already hired Oleg for her 2026 wedding! He is one of a kind, extremely passionate, and I truly hope you choose his team to trust with preserving your most precious memories.”Jessica C., 6 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-videographers/zaya-production)
