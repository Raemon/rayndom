  * ### Flawless Wedding Venue

•Verified review

•Elizabeth U.•Apr 1, 2025

Thank you so much for hosting our wedding. Renee and her staff did an amazing job. We also, hosted our Rehearsal Dinner the night before our wedding and their team was easily able to accommodate 30 guests for dinner. The decorations, set up and flow of the night for our wedding was flawless. If we ran into any issues, Renee was quick to find a solution and took away any stress we may have had. I truly appreciate everything you did for us and we look forward to referring our friends and family to the hotel for their special occasions.

  * ### The plan got executed and the result was amazing! 

•Verified review

•Victoria•Feb 24, 2025

We only had 7 months to plan and wanted to stick within a budget. but have something beautiful. University Plaza Waterfront Hotel offered just the right pricing with a stunning courtyard, dining area, and spacious ballroom. There were a few mishaps but Renee and her staff took care of us and ensured that our needs were met. We set several appointments throughout this time frame and Renee worked with us to keep these appointments running smoothly, worked well with staff and other vendors to make sure our day was special as could be. Renee responded to my emails promptly and helped me plan the reception program, floor plan of the ballroom, answered my 101 questions and so much more. Renee and the University Plaza Waterfront Hotel staff had our best interest in consideration from pricing, to decorating, to our guests, and all the things in between. I truly enjoyed that there were plenty of rooms for my big guest list from so many different countries and states. Everybody had enough space to enjoy themselves, the kids played all around in the courtyard, safety was good, and the sunset was just great. The Univeristy Plaza Waterfront felt like our home. We are so thrilled and pleased that we chose to have our wedding at this venue, because although it was hectic(as any wedding would be) at times it was an absolute blast!

  * ### Great wedding! 

•Verified review

•Stevie S.•Aug 15, 2024

This venue and the people were top notch. Renee responded quickly to all of our questions and requests. This was overall a great experience presented by good people. All of the guests provided positive feedback on the facility and accommodations. What a great experience!

  * ### Wedding of my dreams! 

•Verified review

•Marissa•Aug 15, 2024

Had my wedding here back in November of 2024. I cannot describe the beauty that the entire event held. From the moment my guest walked in the experience began. From the marble flooring throughout the entrance and lobby area to the ball room screams ELEGANCE ! Set up was extremely easy and the people who were there working the floor from the hotel were so helpful in anything my vendors needed. I received feedback almost immediately. The room was very spacious and had more than enough space for my 130 guest to socialize and be present for my special day!
