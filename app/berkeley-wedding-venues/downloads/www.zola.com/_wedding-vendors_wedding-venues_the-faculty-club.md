## About this venue

Built in 1902 by the renowned architect Bernard Maybeck in traditional Arts and Crafts style, it's designed to create a cozy, intimate feeling. The crowning glory of the club is the three-story Great Hall. With its vaulted ceiling, massive stone fireplace, and stained-glass windows featuring heraldic crests of the great universities of the world, it's reminiscent of many a European cathedral. Light from the floor-to-ceiling windows warms the redwood paneling and suffuses the Hall in a golden glow. Two charming smaller spaces are also available for functions. The Heyns and Seaborg rooms (named respectively after a chancellor and a distinguished University Nobel Laureate) both have French doors leading to a private outdoor area with a garden view. The Faculty Club has been serving its members and guests for over 100 years and will do everything possible to make your event successful and enjoyable.

  * ### Fantastic indoor/outdoor wedding program

•Verified review

•George H.•Jun 29, 2022

The Faculty Club was a pleasure to work with. They're very professional and have great insights into different setups and options. They worked with all our vendors and made sure all items we needed were provided. Setup and breakdown were also done in an efficient manner and very happy with our cocktail hour on the glade and dinner inside.
