The staff was so helpful throughout the planning process, always responsive and truly invested in making our vision come to life. Our day of coordinator Jennifer was outstanding!

The space was clean, beautifully maintained, and they did an amazing job setting up all of my decorations exactly how I imagined.

“We had our wedding last November and Fogo de Chão was very helpful in every step of the way. We booked 3 rooms which was perfect for our small wedding. The staff was very helpful as well as the event and general manager. Food was delicious as always. Our ceremony ended early and the manager was nice accommodating our guests a little bit earlier while we got our photos taken. It was such a good experience that now my husband wants to celebrate our anniversary every year at Fogo de Chão.”Priscila H., 3 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/fogo-de-chao-san-jose-ca)
