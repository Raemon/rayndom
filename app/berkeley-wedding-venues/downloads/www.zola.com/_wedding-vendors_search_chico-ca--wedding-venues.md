“My husband and I got married in Mendocino in early August and chose MacCallum House (or Mac House) as our reception location and couldn't have been happier with how it all turned out. We knew we wanted to get married along the Mendocino coast and the most important things for us were being able to throw a memorable party and have incredible food. During our venue search, we were challenged with the logistics of lodging our guests (around 80) at reasonable price points, quiet hours that would cap our party time and figuring out transportation within a comfortable budget that wasn't cumbersome to our group. We were drawn to the Mac House due to it's insanely convenient location (our guests didn't have to use any cars once they arrived and enjoyed the town at their own pace within walking distance) and beautiful rooms at a very affordable rate but we were hook, line, sinker SOLD when we had dinner at the restaurant and tried their food. WOW. We worked really closely with Summer, who was the awesomely vivacious Mac House coordinator and our personal cheerleader as we embarked on planning our wedding within 6 months. We decided to have our ceremony a few minutes away at Cypress Grove (which the Mac House helped us plan) and due to our party size, opted to host the reception in a tent on the Mac House lawn. Our wedding was truly the best day of our lives and our guests could not stop telling us how incredible the food was, how beautiful the tent looked, and most importantly how much FUN they had. I have to give a special shoutout to the entire staff who worked our event. Everyone was so kind, so attentive, and so lovely that it made a real lasting impression on everyone. I had one guest say to me verbatim "you never really notice the service at weddings but I noticed how amazing the service was at yours". We had multiple people tell us that we had the best wedding food they had ever had (we're both in our late 30s so we take that compliment as high praise as most ppl have been to tons of weddings at that point) and our party kept going till midnight before some of our guests spilled over to the local bars to keep going. The only slight bump leading up to the weekend was that it was clear to us that the Mac House was navigating some moving parts with their business this year (dealing with the aftermath of a really wet winter season, ordering new furniture, etc) and it took a while to get answers to certain questions but honestly, at no point was it stressful and it all worked out beyond our expectations. Saya (the GM), Chef Alan, and Summer are all wonderful people and they worked their tails off to give us an incredible weekend that we and our family and friends will never forget. We are huge fans of the Mac House and their entire team and can't wait to go back and visit again.”Aya D., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/maccallum-house)

## About wedding venues in Chico, CA

### Why Is Chico a Perfect Wedding Destination?

Chico's Northern California location offers wedding venues surrounded by redwood forests, flowing waterfalls and Spanish-style gardens that create unforgettable backdrops for your special day. The Palms gives you multiple ceremony options including a lush garden, charming gazebo, dramatic bridge entry and an English garden platform beautifully framed by towering redwoods. At the Griffith House you'll appreciate wheelchair-accessible pathways throughout its stunning Spanish-style gardens. Unlike bigger California cities with their urban sprawl, Chico venues typically come with plenty of parking and easy access to downtown while still feeling like a natural retreat where you and your guests can fully focus on celebrating.

### What's the Average Cost of Wedding Venues in Chico?

Wedding venues in Chico typically take up about 18% of your total wedding budget compared to the national average of 25% where couples spend between $6,500-$12,000. You'll love this value as it lets you allocate more of your budget to other wedding elements without sacrificing beautiful settings. For different guest counts, your total wedding costs will look something like this:

  * 50 guests (small wedding): $22,946
  * 100 guests: $38,293
  * 150 guests: $52,719
  * 200 guests: $65,609
  * 250 guests: $78,500
  * 300 guests (large wedding): $91,390



### Which Accessible Venues Can You Choose From in Chico?

The Westport Event Venue offers a fully handicap accessible indoor space with a temperature-controlled grand ballroom that accommodates up to 300 guests so everyone on your list can celebrate comfortably. You'll find the Griffith House particularly accommodating with its wheelchair-accessible pathways throughout the beautiful Spanish-style gardens. Most hotels and modern event spaces in Chico provide full accessibility alongside comprehensive services while nature venues like Chico Creek Nature Center may have some limitations due to terrain but still offer unique natural beauty for your celebration.

### How Much Should You Budget for Wedding Services in Chico?

For a wedding with 150 guests, here's how your costs typically break down across major service categories:

Service Category| Average Cost| % of Total Budget

This approach offers a much more engaging experience than simple video feeds so your loved ones who can't attend in person still feel connected to your celebration in meaningful ways.
