Hi I’m Emma, the owner and lead designer for Wonderfully Made Floral Design, a studio florist based in Sonoma County, California. I’ve been a part of the floral industry for over 8 years, working in a wide range of jobs, from quality control to designing luxurious weddings.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Working with Emma for my wedding was a dream! She really helped bring my vision to life in a beautiful and cohesive way. She had the perfect balance of understanding and respecting what I wanted, but paired with her knowledge of the industry she was able to make suggestions to help really bring that vision to life in a way that was so much better than I could’ve ever imagined. The florals for my wedding were very important to me and I couldn’t be happier with the end result. The bridal bouquet she designed for me was absolutely stunning, it was exactly what I wanted! It reflected both my personality and wedding theme perfectly. Working with her was also just so easy, she had great communication throughout the whole planning process.

Pollen Floral 5.0

  * Starts at $5,000 
  * Serves Tiburon, CA

We are a Sonoma County based studio florist. We believe flowers have been an essential part of human ceremony since the beginning of time and we strive to honor all rituals with beautiful, contemporary floral design. All Are Welcome.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“How to capture the INCREDIBLE impact Ale had on our wedding? I would have to start with our first meeting. My wife and I were stresssssing about wedding planning and starting to feel like the whole process was going to be painful. Enter: Alejandra. She came to our home and sat out on our deck with us to chat flowers. Her energy was kind, enthusiastic, and so, so grounded. It turned our whole wedding process around, and made us feel like anything was possible. She helped us go from random, disjointed floral dreams to a colorful and cohesive vision for a beautiful wedding day. My wife and I had different priorities, and even some clashing ideas about arrangements and particular blooms. Ale came up with suggestions that made both of us feel heard and delighted. In the end, we had a spectacular sunflower arrangement at our ceremony, which played off our hanging acrylic backdrop and redwood forest setting, a white ranunculus and kumquat bridal bouquet, a groom's boutonniere to match, and table arrangements that brought in whites, oranges, and fresh citrus to honor my family's history. Ale went out of her way to make a special boutonniere for our 7-year-old family friend who was a "flower boy," as well as to bring buckets of flowers for my mom and her cousins to arrange for bouquets inside the house. The bridal bouquet was my single favorite detail from the entire wedding. I had heard a lot, during wedding planning, about flowers being easily disappointing, as sometimes the blooms you're hoping for aren't available. Our flowers went so beyond my expectations, or what I could have asked for. And Alejandra was an absolute angel to work with. We are so grateful, and would encourage anyone to work with Pollen Floral.

I contacted her weeks before our elopement. Not only did she squeeze me in, but she also made a digital mock up so I felt comfortable moving forward with the purchase. These weren’t just flowers… this was art. Our photographer (who has seen many florals and table scapes) even commented that this is one of the best she has ever seen. TY for making our day extra special.”Alex A., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/bfededf5-c662-40c7-9093-e178def7c632?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/mint-peonies-floral-studio)

The flowers were absolutely perfect. They were better than I even imagined and I was thrilled to walk into the reception and see them. They went above and beyond. We had so many compliments and I could not have been happier. They were extremely accessible via email and were very good about getting right back to me. We met twice before the big day and both times I saw things that I would like changed and they were very open to it. They never made me feel bad for telling them I didn't like it and were happy to go through the process of figuring out what I really wanted. They were a pleasure to work with and we will recommend them to anyone who asks.

In 2013, 8-year wedding veteran Amy McCord Jones realizes she wouldn't be able to afford to hire her own floral services if she was a bride. Then, Amy discovers that there is basically zero help available for DIY brides. No flower recipes. No instructions. No access to florist-grade blooms. Rude. So she launches Flower Moxie! Flower Moxie remains a humble, tucked-away small business out of Oklahoma City. We don’t zoom around on scooters in some fancy high-rise. We stock an average kitchen with canned wine and Aldi chips and listen to true crime podcasts while photographing curvy ranunculus. Join us.

We explored different flower options together, dissected my Pinterest board, and she helped me craft pure magic—all within my budget. The custom recipes she created were incredibly helpful and gave me the perfect guidance to DIY the flowers of my dreams. Here are some pictures of my bouquet, my bridesmaids’ bouquets, and the ceremony/reception arrangements.

From start to finish, Brittany was responsive, caring and efficient! We rented the ‘Moody Romance’ suite and I purchased an add on of a custom bridal bouquet and boutonnière! I had done thorough research on purchasing real flowers and while price was our driving factor, I loved the element of saving on waste with renting and the option to purchase a keepsake! Brittany spent time talking to me so many times about questions I had and was incredibly patient! With the custom bouquet, I was able to upload inspiration photos and she NAILED it! The shipping process was so seamless as well. Brittany provided the tracking numbers and thorough instructions on receiving and then returning the flowers. I pride myself on getting ALL the flowers returned in record time (Brittany said) ;) All of our guests couldn’t believe the flowers were fake and everyone was raving about them!

🌹 WE ARE NOT FRESH FLOWER FLORISTS. WE WORK WITH WOOD & FAUX FLOWERS. PLEASE ACKNOWLEDGE THIS IN YOUR REPLY. 🌹 Wood & Word Blooms is run by a Jen Angle, former teacher of 20+ years and specializes in using hand-painted wood flowers along with a faux, dried and preserved florals (nothing fresh here) to bring your wedding vision to life not just for that one glorious day but forever. Besides designing for you, I also offer DIY Wood Flower Experiences to create your wedding florals alongside me in person or virtually and 1:1 sessions to help DIY brides learn to do it themselves.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Working with Jen for our October 2025 wedding was AMAZING!! From the moment we sent in an online inquiry, Jen was attentive, responsive, thoughtful, and incredibly detail oriented. She got us set up with a project planning doc immediately, and she was SO patient with us even when we were annoyingly indecisive about our vision lol. She met with us via Zoom to answer all of our questions when we were struggling to finish the document (and she is just as thorough and helpful via Zoom as she is via email). Once we placed our final order, Jen was communicative and thorough about the process of what happened next in terms of pickup, payment, etc. When we picked up our flowers, we were ASTOUNDED by how beautiful they were. I mean, we knew they would be beautiful, but truly, WOW. Aside from bouquets & boutonnieres, we also got garlands to use as centerpieces for our guests’ farmhouse tables, as well as small wooden circle magnets with a flower on top (we wood burned the j c into them ourselves) to use as favors. And they all looked incredible. An employee at our venue said that our decor was “the best she’s ever seen this place look,” and a large part of our decor was these flowers. I cannot recommend Jen and Wood and Word Blooms ENOUGH!!! PS bouquet photo is from today (1/5/26)!!

  * Starts at $350 
  * Serves Tiburon, CA

Bloom Culture helps couples DIY their wedding flowers with confidence — even if you’ve never arranged flowers before. We ship wholesale flowers to your door and provide a full plan that shows you what to order, how much you need, and how to put everything together. You’ll know exactly how many stems go into each bouquet, centerpiece, boutonniere — and how to assemble them step-by-step. Choose one of our DIY flower kits or get a custom plan based on your colors, style, and budget.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“The flowers (on our order) came in large boxes, but they were not labeled, so it took a minute to get the flowers both identified and properly set up. To be fair we were warned about the process, but not about the length of time due to our inexperience. As a note, it took my fiancé 5 hours to process the flowers when first receiving them. I also did not have any updates from them from the time I ordered till they were being shipped. They were beyond more affordable compared to other florists, and the flowers arrived alive and in good spirits. We were able to keep the flowers alive for over four days!! Many of the flowers that we chose did not have specific instructions, so we had to follow the general reference for the flowers and hope for the best. Additionally, some of the flowers that we wanted were not in stock, and they were replaced for us with substitutes but were not notified until we had all of the flowers already delivered to us. Also, as a note, bloom culture uses third party sellers for their flowers, so the quality may vary depending on location. Our flowers were in good condition, and the company we had clearly took good care of the flowers prior to delivering them to us. Would we do it again? Probably not, but it made for good laughs and bonding time and we have stories to tell from it!”Hannah H., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/36a6f8b7-2bac-47a0-89d6-63ff0d0d678c?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/bloom-culture-flowers)

Found Floral 5.0

My name is Judy Leung (she/her) and Found Floral is based in San Francisco Bay area & beyond. Found floral is rooted in intentional and modern approach to floral and event design. With a focus on creating a flowerful experience that celebrates the culture and stories that are uniquely yours.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Working with Judy at Found Floral was one of the best decisions my husband and I made during our wedding planning process! I knew I wanted florals that were textured and unique and not too cookie-cutter or traditional, so this was my top criteria when searching for a florist. Judy was able to masterfully bring the vintage backyard dinner party feel to our wedding which had 260 guests and still make our wedding feel unique (each table had different tropical and rarely seen flowers). Over 20 of our guests have mentioned to me since how much they loved the florals at our wedding since then - so many people have complimented our florals and shared that they are their favorite florals they've ever seen at a wedding and are still thinking about them today (some guests even have group texts focused specifically on our wedding florals)! The other big thing Judy did for us was the florals for the mandap (arch) for the ceremony - it was so spectacular and such an incredible focal point! It was raining for our entire ceremony so we were grateful to have a pop of color against the grey backdrop. The Found Floral team also used such unique flowers for the arch and laid them out in a way that was the perfect balance of textured but also refined (without being stiff or overly formal). My favorite part of working with Judy was that she took the time to understand my vision but then was able to operate and make decisions independently to bring that vision to life. There are 10000 things to do during wedding planning and it was such a relief to know we were in good hands with Judy and not having to make tiny decisions like picking out individual flowers or greenery or designing much of anything. I would work with Judy again in a heartbeat - she has such a chic unique style and is warm and makes her clients feel so comfortable at every stage of the process. Found Floral truly is the best florist in the Bay Area!!”Joanna K., 2 years ago![](https://images.zola.com/12e771a6-5cf2-412f-aac0-2cd9ab246860?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/found-floral)

From the very beginning, they were quick to reply, patient with all of our questions, and consistently communicative throughout the entire process. Planning a wedding can feel overwhelming at times, but Alba’s responsiveness and professionalism gave us such peace of mind—we always knew we were in good hands. The quality of their work was outstanding, and the value they provided was beyond what we could have hoped for. They worked thoughtfully within our budget, never making us feel like we had to compromise on our vision. Their strike team was worth every penny, handling everything seamlessly so that we could simply enjoy the day without worrying about logistics. It truly felt effortless, and that kind of stress-free experience is priceless. One of the things we loved most was how Alba captured our wedding theme perfectly. We had shared our Pinterest board, and they brought it to life in a way that felt even better than we imagined. Every floral arrangement, every detail, was so intentional and cohesive—it was like stepping into the dream we had been envisioning for months. They even went above and beyond by sending us progress photos along the way, which made us feel included and excited during the planning process. On top of that, they shared so much of our wedding on their Instagram, which was such a fun surprise and gave us another way to relive the day. What stood out most, though, was the genuine care Alba showed for us and our special day. It never felt like we were just another client; they treated our wedding with the same love and attention they would give to their own family. That personal touch made all the difference, and we couldn’t have asked for a better florist or partner in creating our celebration. We wholeheartedly recommend Alba Decorations to any couple looking for a florist who is not only talented and professional but also deeply invested in making your day unforgettable.
