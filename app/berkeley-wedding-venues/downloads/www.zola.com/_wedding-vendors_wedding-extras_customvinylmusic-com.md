I bought this for my daughter and son in laws wedding. It had some of their wedding songs on it. When they received it, they were blown away at the quality. The sound was excellent and they loved the pictures we chose for the cover and album. What a unique gift! This is something they can cherish and play their wedding songs on each Anniversary. Highly highly recommend!!!

Yes, of course. Using our service you will be able to fully customize not only jacket's front and back but labels too. Plus if you are ordering the photo, color or art vinyl disc you would be able to customize both sides of vinyl disc and add any text or audio.

### How many minutes of music or audio can I include on the disc?

We can include up to 20 minutes of music or audio per side (40 minutes total) on a 12" disc, which typically fits about 4–5 songs per side. For a 7" disc, the limit is up to 7 minutes per side. These limits ensure safe playback — exceeding them may trigger your turntable’s auto-stop function, which protects the tonearm from damage.
