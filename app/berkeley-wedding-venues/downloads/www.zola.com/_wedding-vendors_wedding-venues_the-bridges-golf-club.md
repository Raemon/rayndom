The archways have tall French doors and windows, and the facility is climate controlled for year-round comfort.

### Clubhouse

The Clubhouse is great for an intimate event.

When you enter the clubhouse lobby, a pair of elaborate wrought-iron gates to your left opens into a swanky bar inside one of those exotic towers you noticed out front. The bar adjoins the Golfer’s Patio, where guests can quaff cocktails under the shade of a sycamore. Wall sconces and an antique-style chandelier produce a romantic candelabra effect. Hold your ceremony in front of the Fireplace for a warm, winter wedding.

From the moment we reached out to The Bridges Golf Club, their communication was nothing short of amazing. The staff were incredibly supportive, patient, and professional in helping us plan our special day. The venue itself was truly breathtaking - romantic, spacious, and filled with natural light that created a beautiful, bright atmosphere. They worked tirelessly to accommodate all of our needs and requests, going above and beyond to ensure our wedding day was perfect. We are so grateful to the team at The Bridges Golf Club for helping to make our wedding day an unforgettable experience. Special shout out and big THANK YOU to Sharon Cox who worked with me from beginning to end!!! i couldn’t have done it without you.

  * ### Bridges ruined our wedding

  * ### Beautiful venue, delicious food

•Verified review

•Nina X.•Apr 29, 2023

My husband and I got married here early January 2023. So thankful were we able to secure this venue. We had 6 months to plan for a wedding 180 guests and I was stressed. Thankfully this place was available on our date of choice. We visited 5 venues and couldn't get Bridges out of our minds. Both Sandy & Sharon were easy to reach via email. Sandy was so helpful with the facilitation process. And whoa, the food was really good. Our guests enjoyed the meals so much. We held our ceremony in the clubhouse and the reception in the garden pavilion. The space was huge and allowed for that classic, timeless look we were going for. I will add that the venue is fairly strict with decor and responsibilities so review your contract closely. The bridal room is detached (not inside and quite small) so adjust your schedule accordingly. There is no equivalent room for the groom. Not a huge deal breaker. We wanted to do our ceremony on the golf course but we decided to Sri j with indoors due to weather. Beautiful views though. We pass by this venue occasionally and seeing it from the road elicits heartwarming emotions and wonderful memories. Highly recommended!
