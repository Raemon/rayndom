  * ### The perfect venue! 

•Verified review

•Ashley (McCullough) T.•Sep 30, 2023

Both my wife and I are from bay areas so it was important to get married by the water. I can’t stress enough how beautiful this venue is. It’s pretty much all inclusive, you can bring your own booze, vendors and decorations. It includes a stay in their fabulous inn which is 4 bedrooms. Our whole bridal party stayed and it was the best experience. We decided to book the night before too. You can even take pictures on the Marina docks right next to the property (for a small fee). The place itself is so dreamy, we used one lawn for our ceremony and one for lawn games and our cocktail tables. Watching the sunset from the reception space and the sparkly lights on both lawns was just sooo gorgeous. Now for the team, they went ABOVE and BEYOND to accommodate our requests and answer all my hundred questions and they were so flexible with us when we had to postpone for Covid twice. We are incredibly grateful for the team. They shared all their tips and tricks and made our wedding perfect. The coordination between the wedding venue and our planner was flawless. And best part was the seamless delivery of our late night snack, hot pretzels! And the space perfect accommodated a photo booth which everyone loved. We finally got married in September 2023! I highly recommend as a wedding venue 10/10.

  * ### Perfect spot for our wedding!

•Verified review

•Rachel D.•Oct 13, 2022

We were looking for a beautiful low key venue for our wedding. The Lighthouse was by far even better than we imagined! We primarily worked with Maggie who was fantastic! She was very realistic when it came to helping us stay within our budget and gave us some excellent vendor recommendations accordingly. We had a few meetings with her along the way and she listened to what we wanted and helped us stay on task getting everything sorted out. She was super flexible and accommodating with us on the day of the wedding. Maggie and Alma were both there the day of the wedding and they were both busy making sure everything was running smoothly! In addition to how wonderful they are, this venue is the most beautiful! We used the outside and inside area. We heard from several of our guests that it was the most beautiful venue (and wedding ;) ) they had attended! We have the absolute best memories from this day and wouldn’t change a thing!

  * ### Comfortable and aesthetically appealing

•Verified review

•Hanna R.•Aug 28, 2022

We had a two ceremony 150 person guest wedding, and the space was perfect. Maggie worked closely with us the entire time, and she is a gem. The right amount of communication, and really answered our needs and wants. No fluff. And having the 4 BR apartment was so helpful.

  * ### The Lighthouse has it all!

•Verified review

•Aurora Catering•May 16, 2022

The Lighthouse is beautiful, nestled in Solano County, right on the marina. For weddings, there's space for an outdoor ceremony, followed by an indoor/outdoor appetizer hour, and either reception on the lawn or in the beautiful indoor space with the large windows and marina view. The venue managers come with years of experience and expertise and have a high-quality vendor list. We highly recommend The Lighthouse for your wedding, special social event, team building or another corporate event! They also have a beautiful suite on the top floor. Be sure to check it out!

## Frequently asked questions

6 Answers

Ask them a question

### What is your peak season?

Peak Season at The Lighthouse is May through October

### What is your off-peak season?

Off-Peak Season at The Lighthouse is November through April

### Can we bring our own alcohol?

All alcohol must be serviced by a licensed and insured vendor. There is no self-service alcohol allowed. Many full-service caterers have the capability to serve your purchased alcohol. If you intend for alcohol to be sold at your private event (i.e. you are not purchasing it yourself), you will be required to contract a third-party licensed beverage service company with a valid liquor license. Many beverage vendors provide affordable beverage packages as well as some of our Approved Full-Service Caterers. Please ask your sales representative for guidance or refer to our extensive Preferred Partners list.

### Do you have accessible facilities?

Yes, The Lighthouse is wheelchair accessible. There is a ramp to access both lawns from the West side of the building, and accessible restrooms.

### Do you have on-site parking?

Yes, there are forty-five (45) self-parking spaces available in the Glen Cove Marina parking lot for events free of charge. We do not, however, guarantee the number or locations of parking spaces for any event. Additional non-exclusive free parking may be available in designated areas around The Lighthouse GCM, including a large parking lot located at 155 Glen Cove Marina Road.

### Do we need to get insurance?

Yes. We require proof of a minimum of a $1,000,000 policy listing The Lighthouse LLC as additional insured and must include Host Liquor Liability. The Certificate of Insurance is due 60 days before your event and is to be acquired separately. We recommend www.wedsafe.com or www.eventhelper.com. The average cost is around $175. We also highly recommend event insurance which is separate from liability insurance. Both are available through the websites listed above. Additionally, vendors are required to provide a copy of their Certificate of Insurance for your event. Please see the Facility Use Policies for more details.
