  * ### Amazing experience

•Verified review

•Erin•Apr 30, 2025

From the moment I first reached out to Kismet., I was impressed by their clear, helpful, and quick communication. Kelly and her team were so careful and thorough in planning every detail of our wedding. They truly made me and my wedding feel special, and I didn't have to worry about any issues on the day. She also recommended two other vendors I used and had a great experience with. I had such a great experience and feel so lucky to have found Kismet - I don't think I would have been as happy with anyone else!

  * ### Kismet delivers on the perfect wedding day!

•Verified review

•Lorenzo•Dec 23, 2024

As a venue manager, having a competent and talented wedding planner can make or break the perfect wedding day, and Kismet always comes through for their clients. I have worked with Rosie who is personable, communicative, and detail oriented, and I can honestly say we breathe a sigh of relief when we see another booked wedding with these talented ladies!

  * ### Blown away

•Verified review

•Jolene - Arista Winery•Jan 9, 2024

I had the pleasure of working with the Kismet team (Kelly and Rosie) on an event this past autumn. Kelly was extremely professional and did a great job of communicating with me regarding the event logistics. She had an eye for detail and the entire event was elegant and the guests were over the moon happy. For anyone planning a wedding (or any other event for that matter), I highly recommend utilizing the Kismet planning team. Once you communicate your vision, they will work to see it through to fruition so that you can be present and enjoy the event. I can't wait to work with them again!

  * ### Thank you Kismet!

•Verified review

•Kate & D.•Jan 5, 2024

I would recommend Kismet Event Co. without hesitation. Kelly is the best and it's always a pleasure to work with them. Besides being experienced and super organized, they are also so sweet and make planning a wedding stress-free. With all the ideas available online these days, along with family and friend input, it is easy to get overwhelmed by all the decisions to consider. They provided us with a planning toolkit and checked in regularly throughout our time working together to keep everything simple for us. Thank you for making our wedding day so memorable! We got exactly what we wanted, and we will be eternally grateful to you and your team!
