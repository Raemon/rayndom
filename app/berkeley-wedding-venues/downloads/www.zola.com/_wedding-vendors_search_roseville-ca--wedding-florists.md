Flowers by Heather 5.0

  * Starts at $2,000 
  * Serves Roseville, CA

After serving the Bay Area for years, I've moved to Lincoln and looking forward to serving our new community. A little about me: Always lived in the country raising cattle and horses. Grew up learning from mother about all things florals. Worked in vet med for years while also doing wedding flowers with my mother. Now that my husband and I have moved to Lincoln I decided to start my floral business full time.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Flowers by Heather was a pleasure to work with for our wedding. They had a quick response time, were extremely helpful, and gave us exactly what we wanted. The quality of their work was stunning - the flowers were absolutely perfect, from the boutonnières and bouquets to the beautiful displays around the venue. Heather and her team were wonderful to work with and helped make our special day even more beautiful. We couldn't be happier with the service and value we received from Flowers by Heather.”Kim P., 8 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/b3d19deb-a372-4b79-9984-de7169053dfd?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/flowers-by-heather)

Elissa Dunn Floral Studio 5.0

  * Starts at $5,000

Welcome friends! My name is Elissa, and I own Elissa Dunn Floral Studio. I provide floral designs for weddings and events in Northern CA. I currently reside in El Dorado Hills with my husband and our two dogs, Cash & Cooper. When I am not flowering, I enjoy fly fishing, hiking, and spending time with friends and family. I’ve always had a creative and entrepreneurial spirit, however upon graduating school I had no idea what I wanted to pursue. A close friend helped me to secure an office admin job at an amazing floral design company in the Bay Area.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Elissa was absolutely fantastic to work with.

Timeless Arches, LLC 5.0

  * Offer

I grew up in a florist shop and always loved flowers. When faux flower became so good they were fooling gardeners and bees, I knew this business would be good for everyone. I can help save the environment as well as make wedding ceremonies absolutely stunning! I specialize in making the ceremony site dazzle with large floral pre-made instillations. These florals can be moved, for a small relocation fee, to your reception to make a dynamic sweetheart, cake table or entryway. I do not offer centerpieces or bouquets. I have found most brides want these fresh. I do however carry single rose bud centerpieces in white, pink or red only.“Lush and amazing, it was hard to believe the flowers weren't real. They were pleasant to touch, soft and plaint, almost moist looking. Heather Dodd was most pleasant to work with and full of creative ideas.”Nanci, 16 days ago![](https://images.zola.com/ce31cea4-91b6-465e-b626-9a4cbba25b71?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/timeless-arches-llc)

We had A destination wedding in June in Florida so real flowers would have just wilted so these were a perfect choice. My only critic is that the corsage and boutonnières were pretty used. They weren’t the prettiest but the 2 bouquets I ordered looked pretty good. I do recommend them especially for a destination wedding and low cost.”Kathy V., 5 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/9ef2cbcc-3821-4067-9e2e-66d97a3b634d?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/something-borrowed-blooms)

Flower Moxie – Do-It-Yourself Wedding Flowers 4.9

In 2013, 8-year wedding veteran Amy McCord Jones realizes she wouldn't be able to afford to hire her own floral services if she was a bride. Then, Amy discovers that there is basically zero help available for DIY brides. No flower recipes. No instructions. No access to florist-grade blooms. Rude. So she launches Flower Moxie! Flower Moxie remains a humble, tucked-away small business out of Oklahoma City. We don’t zoom around on scooters in some fancy high-rise. We stock an average kitchen with canned wine and Aldi chips and listen to true crime podcasts while photographing curvy ranunculus. Join us.

From the vibrant heart of the San Francisco Bay Area to the idyllic embrace of Carmel Valley, our passion ignites, our creativity blooms, and dreams are transformed into breathtaking reality.

From her professionalism down to her attention to detail, there was not a single step of the planning process that we were not completely blown away by Autumn and her work! During the early phases of our wedding planning process, we had received 6 different floral proposals from various florists local to the Bay Area. Autumn's proposal blew every other company's out of the water! Coming in at 20 pages, her proposal outlined our color pallet and inspo photos for the conceptual design, the exact flowers (with pictures) she chose based on our vision, the exact vessels, candles, and candle holders she had in mind, and pricing for each bouquet, boutonniere, and arrangement. Shortly after receiving her proposal, and prior to making our final decision on florist, I flew into San Fran on a last-minute work trip. I reached out to her literally as I was touching down at SFO to see if she was available to meet at our venue to go over design and vision. Autumn immediately dropped everything and met me on site within an hour! That alone earned our business - she was committed to us and our vision from the very beginning. Throughout the planning process, Autumn ensured my husband I stayed involved in the decision making process, regularly sending options for different vessels, candles, candle holders, ribbon selections, and design preferences. On the week of the wedding, she asked if I would like updates as she arranged our florals to which I said OF COURSE! Daily she sent me the sweetest photos and videos of the bouquets, aisle arch, etc. which was the shining light pulling me through an incredibly stressful and busy final week of planning/travel! We truly cannot speak highly enough about Autumn, her amazing work, her attention to detail, and professionalism throughout the entire process! Our wedding day went off without a hitch and it was SO FUN seeing her on the day of our wedding after 2 years of planning together! If you're on the fence with who to choose as your florist, make no mistake, Autumn is the absolute BEST and will ensure your vision comes to life down to every last detail!”Melissa K., 5 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/666a1782-70ed-4801-8258-66223b9ad9fe?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/l-artiste-fleur)

Bloom Culture: Do-it-yourself Wedding Flowers 4.9

Bloom Culture helps couples DIY their wedding flowers with confidence — even if you’ve never arranged flowers before. We ship wholesale flowers to your door and provide a full plan that shows you what to order, how much you need, and how to put everything together. You’ll know exactly how many stems go into each bouquet, centerpiece, boutonniere — and how to assemble them step-by-step. Choose one of our DIY flower kits or get a custom plan based on your colors, style, and budget.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“The flowers (on our order) came in large boxes, but they were not labeled, so it took a minute to get the flowers both identified and properly set up. To be fair we were warned about the process, but not about the length of time due to our inexperience. As a note, it took my fiancé 5 hours to process the flowers when first receiving them. I also did not have any updates from them from the time I ordered till they were being shipped. They were beyond more affordable compared to other florists, and the flowers arrived alive and in good spirits. We were able to keep the flowers alive for over four days!! Many of the flowers that we chose did not have specific instructions, so we had to follow the general reference for the flowers and hope for the best. Additionally, some of the flowers that we wanted were not in stock, and they were replaced for us with substitutes but were not notified until we had all of the flowers already delivered to us. Also, as a note, bloom culture uses third party sellers for their flowers, so the quality may vary depending on location. Our flowers were in good condition, and the company we had clearly took good care of the flowers prior to delivering them to us. Would we do it again?
