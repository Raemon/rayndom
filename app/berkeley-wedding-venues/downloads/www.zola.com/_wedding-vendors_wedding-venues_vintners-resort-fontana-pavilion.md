## About this venue

Experience Sonoma’s first luxury resort on a working vineyard. Embraced by a 92-acre estate, Vintners Resort is an intimate hideaway set amidst redwood trees, colorful gardens, and fountain courtyards. Connect to the land at John Ash & Co., one of Sonoma’s first farm-to-table restaurants, overlooking a vineyard. Relax in our spa, take a dip in the outdoor heated plunge pool, or play a game of bocce ball. Just 60 miles north of San Francisco, Vintners Resort is the gateway to the Russian River Valley and all of Sonoma County’s famed wineries and culinary destinations. Your Vintners escape comes to life with heartfelt service from our long-tenured team, dedicated to creating treasured moments in every stay.
