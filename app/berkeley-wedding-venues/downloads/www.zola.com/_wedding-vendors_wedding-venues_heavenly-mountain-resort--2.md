## Our event spaces

### Lakeview Lodge

Availability | June-September

Lake Tahoe serves as a stunning backdrop for both a ceremony and reception at Lakeview Lodge, aptly named for the unfiltered view. A mile-long, scenic ascent via the Aerial Tram brings guests to 8,200 feet and the dual-purpose venue. Following an outdoor ceremony overlooking Lake Tahoe and wedding photos on the patio as the sun sets behind Mt. Tallac, dance the evening away under the stars or inside the two-tiered dining room, which offers a lounge area for non-dancers. Pick from two indoor dining rooms that can accommodate groups from 80-170, or combine those areas and use the entire lodge to accommodate up to 250 guests.

#### Guest capacity
