Hello everyone welcome to my site, allow me to introduce myself my name is Toni Burroughs. Born and raised in Ohio, i relocated to New York City in 2016 to further pursue my career as a professional makeup artist. At the time i moved with 5 years of experience i knew i wanted to expand my portfolio and have a variety of looks in my books.

Ive been fortunate enough to been able to do anything from Tv & Film, Vmas, Press, Headshots, Bridal and more. As of 2021 with 9 years of experience i’m constantly on the look out for the next best product on the market to totally satisfy my clients. I ensure all of my clients i will do my very best to accommodate your desired needs.

She provided a natural look for my wife, was punctual(event was 6 hours away), and provided a comfortable environment for all clients. Although I don’t plan to get married again, I would still choose her for future makeup needs.
