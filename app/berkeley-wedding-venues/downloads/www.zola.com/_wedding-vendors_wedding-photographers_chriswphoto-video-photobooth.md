I'm always relaxed and positive. I can be invisible in the background, or I can direct the action if needed. I've been photographing weddings for 16 years so I know my equipment, and I know exactly what I need to capture, so wedding are fun for me now!

  * ### One of Our Favorite Photographers!

•Verified review

•Kristie at Shirley Acres•Dec 16, 2024

Chriswphoto Video Photobooth is one of our favorite photographers and videographers to work with. Chris is very responsive, always open to suggestions and has a ton of out-of-the-box ideas, making him open to trying new things/styles/points of view. His work is classic, vibrant and truly captures the story of our couple's special day. He is always so immersive in the experience, on the dance floor with the guests, encouraging the guests to be involved in the shots which helps him catch many moments many others would have missed. He always helps keep the energy high with the group throughout the night. Chris seamlessly incorporates his videography while snapping the most intimate and wild moments of the celebration! We recommend him to many clients & they all love him! - Kristie

Response from vendor•Dec 17, 2024

Thanks for the amazing review Kristie! I always recommend Shirley Acres to clients that are looking for beautiful venues with 5 star service!
