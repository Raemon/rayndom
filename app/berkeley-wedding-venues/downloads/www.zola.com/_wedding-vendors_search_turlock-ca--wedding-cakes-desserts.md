Little did we know, they are the whole package. We initially wanted to discuss breakfast catering options, but once we received highly detailed emails from Jennifer about her services we then decided to move forward with planning/catering/floral/furniture/signage/wedding cake/tastings/wine pairings and so much more. Cakewalk provided the perfect nature design/coordination, organic farm to table catering and custom cake design with dessert services for our special day. Jennifer is an absolute gem. She connected with us via phone and email multiple times leading up to the big day to plan a truly amazing wedding day. She asked us for our pinterest board, and she really listened to our ideas and concerns. Her emails were very detailed and consisted of multiple design boards. She was very organized and provided us with a comprehensive planning timeline. Jennifer incorporated two new entrees for our dinner service that were not in their original menu selection. During the tasting, she offered the highest degree of service. She also provided the wine pairings for each dish! Jennifer coordinated with all our vendors. She planned a day of coronation timeline that was perfectly executed and was flexible with any changes. She really has a caring eye for detail and made our dream wedding a reality! Our wedding party was intimate with 20 guests and Jennifer and her team really made everyone feel like royalty. We really don't know how we could have done any of this without her. 100/100 the best day of our lives.”Kim & F., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/ca70a014-0d18-415c-9c12-67cbc7e58db0?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-cakes-desserts/cakewalk-heirloom-baking-co)
