  * ### Don't reccommed

•Verified review

•R•Jul 18, 2025

Events by Lisa was an okay wedding planner for our big day. The quality of their work was fairly basic, as they did what was needed to pull off the wedding, but I received some negative feedback from vendors and family members about the way the planner communicated with them. During the rehearsal, the planner seemed a bit rushed and aggressive in her tone when trying to get everyone's attention, even going so far as to clap to get my father-in-law's attention, which I found disrespectful and unprofessional. While I understand the need to stay on schedule, I believe there were better ways the planner could have approached this. Overall, Events by Lisa got the job done, but I expected a bit more polish and professionalism from a wedding planner.

  * ### Unresponsive and Very Disappointing Experience 

•Verified review

•Malia G.•Jul 13, 2025

I hired Lisa for day-of coordination, including pre-wedding support like vendor communication, timeline help, and rehearsal coordination. Per our contract, she was supposed to begin assisting weeks before the wedding, but I never heard from her. I sent multiple texts and emails over time and got no reply. When I finally reached out on March 19th—a little over a month before my April 26th wedding—she responded for the first time and told me she could no longer coordinate due to a family emergency. She hadn’t communicated any of this before I contacted her, even though she had committed to helping long before that point. She refunded my deposit but acted like it was a favor, despite never delivering any of the contracted services. I was left to coordinate my wedding last-minute, which created stress during an already overwhelming time. Unfortunately, I can’t recommend Events by Lisa based on the complete lack of communication and accountability. A coordinator should make your planning process easier—not more chaotic.

  * ### Amazing Wedding Coordinator!

A huge thank you to our wedding coordinator for the incredible organization of our wedding! Everything went flawlessly from start to finish. She was attentive to details, always available, and helped resolve any issues. Our guests were thrilled, and we enjoyed every moment thanks to her professionalism. Highly recommend her to everyone!

Events by Lisa were an absolute pleasure to work with for our wedding. She was always on top of everything, keeping us informed and ensuring every detail was taken care of. The quality of her work and value was very good - if any issue did arise during the planning process, I had no idea about it as they handled it seamlessly behind the scenes. Lisa demonstrated excellent judgement, often making decisions that were better than what my husband and I had envisioned. Overall, Events by Lisa made our special day run flawlessly and we are so grateful for their hard work and expertise.
