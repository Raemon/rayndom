“We had a wonderful wedding - the Wedgewood team helped us create a meaningful ceremony and reception. The pictures online do not do this place justice - you have to see it for yourself! The grounds are beautiful; we had our ceremony at the pavilion and our reception in the garden area / in their indoor hall area. The venue definitely felt like a fairy / cottage core dream to me! Wedgewood also vendors that work with them and provide really excellent services - florals, music, cakes. If you want to have an awesome wedding and reduce your stress, I would check this place out.”Rachael A., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/hacienda-de-las-flores-by-wedgewood-weddings)

The whole JSM team was so amazing to work with and made planning as stress-free as possible. We stuck to the planning timeline they provided in the planning binder (which was SO helpful to have) and had everything ready in time. Our guests all raved about what a fabulous wedding it was. We customized the venue quite a bit bringing in our own decor and personal touches and it did not feel cookie-cutter at all even though it is an all-inclusive venue. I am so happy we chose JSM!! The recommended vendors were all outstanding, the food was delicious, everything ran smoothly during the wedding and I didn't have to stress about a thing. The mansion, ceremony area, and reception tent are all BEAUTIFUL. I could not have asked for a more perfect day.”Alexandra H., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/1cb206fc-f347-4815-84a4-94dca8dc013d?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/jefferson-street-mansion-by-wedgewood-weddings)

The space itself was truly breathtaking, with its amazing new upgrades and beautiful views. However, there were a few details that weren't properly communicated to us, which led to a bit of a rocky start. Although my bridal party and I had lots to deal with prior to ceremony start, these issues were not something our guests would have seen/noticed. To their credit, the Wedgewood team acknowledged their mistakes and upgraded our bar package to make up for it. Overall, the venue was beautiful and the staff did their best to ensure our day went smoothly, despite the initial hiccups.

![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“The gardens at Heather farms was everything we were looking for in a venue. We wanted outdoors with lots of plant life, a reception space that was not a barn, fairytale vibes, ability to choose our own vendors, have a full bar, plenty of time at the venue to have the day of our dreams, and LGBTQ friendly. The gardens delivered all of this and was well within our budget. As a lesbian couple it was very important to us to find a venue and vendors that felt like supportive allies and from our first meeting with GHF we felt very welcome. We also loved that the only vendor they had a preferred list for was catering (the list had many great options and we were very happy with our choice), this allowed us to ensure that all of our other vendors we hired were also allies or members of the queer community. They were great to work with and everything went so smooth the day-of. It was also stunning, the rose gardens feel so magical and I loved that we didn’t need to worry about much decor for the ceremony space. Everything was beautifully in bloom even in mid-October. If I could go back and do it over again I would still choose to get married at the gardens in a heartbeat! Another thing we love is that it’s open to the public when it is not closed for private events, so leading up to our wedding we spent a lot of time visiting just because! We took my mom there for a Mother’s Day picnic and also went with friends. I can’t wait to return as newlyweds again and again.”Chloe S., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/fdbabba9-8460-4e4e-a59f-6bd30f05c705?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-gardens-at-heather-farm)

“We had our wedding at Shadelands Ranch Museum in 2018 and couldn't have been happier with our decision! We had a few parameters to work within — a tight budget, a list of vendors we wanted to work with, and a large guest count. The staff at Shadelands were incredibly accommodating and easy to partner with. Since their policy allows food trucks and other mobile caterers, we were able to hire one of our favorite local BBQ restaurants to cater, which was a huge hit. The venue grounds are large enough to fit a sizeable group — perfect for our guests who brought children — they had plenty of room to run around on the lawn. In the summer, the venue adds string lights in the trees around their gazebo, creating a beautiful and romantic touch when the sun sets. The gazebo served as a beautiful centerpiece and the location for our photo booth. Our DJ had plenty of space to set up on the back patio, which doubled as the dance floor. The venue’s accessibility was incredible, with ample parking, clean restrooms, a kitchen, and a porch for the bride to ‘hide’ until the ceremony. And because the venue provided the tables and chairs, we only needed to rent table linens. Shadelands is the place to book if you want a beautiful and affordable outdoor wedding venue in Walnut Creek that can accommodate both your ceremony and reception. The attentive staff, accessible location, and flexibility around customization make it an ideal place to tie the knot!”Samantha G., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/42ef99a4-45a0-49fb-8145-88e15fcfd297?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/shadelands-ranch-museum)

“We had our wedding at Boundary Oak in May 2024, and I can’t say enough great things about our experience—especially working with Angelique. From our very first tour her professionalism, warmth, and attention to detail were top tier. We toured seven venues before choosing Boundary Oak, and it was the combination of stunning grounds and exceptional customer service that sealed the deal for us. Our initial food tasting was decent—typical wedding food—but a new head chef joined about six months before our wedding. The improvement was noticeable and really elevated our reception meal. Our guests raved about the food! If I had to give any constructive feedback, it would be regarding the bridal suite. While functional, it could definitely benefit from an upgrade. Adding a private bathroom and a lock on the door would make a huge difference in comfort and privacy for the bride on such an important day. Overall, we had a fantastic experience at Boundary Oak and are so grateful to Angelique and the entire team for helping make our day so special!”Kamika W., 8 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/526916a5-33b6-4a5d-b664-51c4f00afa12?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-clubhouse-at-boundary-oak)

![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We are so happy we went with Chabot Space and Science Center for our wedding. We wanted something unique that also aligned with our interests -- our background in physics, astronomy, and space. The staff at Chabot are incredibly kind and were quick to respond to our emails and questions. The space was incredibly expansive and unique for our guests. The planetarium ceremony was our favorite part, and we will treasure those memories forever. As an educator myself, I fully appreciate that Chabot is a non-profit organization and that my deposit/rental fee goes back to the community and staff. Thank you again for making our day so special!”Sara M., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/40eff7a9-c07f-4f35-8d26-53792496f439?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/chabot-space-science-center)

## About wedding venues in Walnut Creek, CA

### 

Walnut Creek offers an exceptional wedding destination that blends Mediterranean-inspired gardens with historic architecture, all set against Mount Diablo's stunning backdrop.
