  * ### Amanda was AMAZING! 

•Verified review

•Alicia S.•Sep 1, 2025

Amanda was absolutely incredible! We could not ask for a better planner! We opted for the partial planning service that she offers and were truly blown away by her! My husband's go to phrase to describe Amanda is “worth her weight in gold”!!! We had the most beautiful day and so much of it was because of her guidance and organization!!

  * ### Amazing Coordinator with a rock star team!!! 

•Verified review

•Nicole K.•Apr 29, 2025

Amanda was an amazing coordinator! We had used her for the last 3 months of our planning process and she was efficient and organized! Her and her team were absolute rockstars day of and my mother and maids of honors witnessed her busting her booty to make our day the best day possible! Highly recommend Amanda for all your wedding planning needs.

  * ### Fredericksburg Wedding

•Verified review

•Payton D.•Apr 8, 2025

Can’t recommend Amanda enough! She went above and beyond for our wedding day. She tackled any issue that came up had such a calming presence for us. They also handled decorations that turned out better than even I planned! As a type-A bride, I felt so comfortable giving her the reigns. Everything came out perfect and beautiful!!

  * ### From Vision to Perfection

•Verified review

•Arianne A.•Mar 22, 2025

I had the absolute pleasure of working with Amanda for my wedding in December 2024, and I can honestly say that choosing her was one of the best decisions we made for our wedding and wedding planning process. From the very start, she was so warm and approachable, making us feel like we were in the best hands. Her attention to detail was impeccable and she took the time to truly understand our vision and preferences, then helped us bring it all to life. On the wedding day itself, Amanda and her team were absolutely on top of everything! She managed all the logistics flawlessly, so we could focus on enjoying our special day. The timeline was executed perfectly, and I never had to worry about a thing. The day went exactly as we envisioned, and I owe that to her thorough planning and organization. I cannot recommend West Monroe Events enough! If you're looking for someone who is not only professional but also genuinely cares about making your wedding day exactly what you've dreamed of, look no further. Amanda truly made our day unforgettable, and I am so grateful for her incredible help and support. :)
