  * ### Bridal hair bridal party

•Verified review

•Jenna•Aug 18, 2025

Henna was truly a dream to have as my hairstylist on my wedding day! She styled my hair exactly how I imagined, it was elegant, flawless, and lasted all night through happy tears and dancing. She also did my bridal party of 5, and every single bridesmaid loved their look and felt so confident. What stood out the most, besides her incredible skill, was Henna’s energy. She’s professional yet so warm, calm, and uplifting. She made our entire morning feel special and stress-free. I’m beyond grateful I had her with me on my big day and would recommend her to every future bride!

  * ### CONFIDENCE BOOST!

•Verified review

•Natalia•Aug 13, 2025

I had the pleasure of having my hair styled by Heena as a bridesmaid in my best friend’s wedding. From the moment she arrived, she was calm, professional, and incredibly friendly—which made such a difference in the getting-ready atmosphere. She took the time to listen to what each of us wanted while also offering suggestions that really elevated the final look. I asked for a soft, romantic updo that would hold through the entire day—and she delivered perfectly. It was elegant without being overdone, and it stayed flawless from the ceremony all the way through hours of dancing at the reception. I received so many compliments, and most importantly, I felt beautiful and confident standing beside the bride. What really stood out was how efficient and organized she was while still making each of us feel pampered. She managed to style a full bridal party without anyone ever feeling rushed. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Heena to anyone looking for a wedding stylist. She truly has a gift, and I’ll absolutely be keeping her in mind for future events!
