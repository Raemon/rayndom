My love for photography sparked from a deeply personal place—watching my children grow up way too quickly and wanting to capture those fleeting moments before they slipped away. This journey turned into a passionate calling, and now, I look to bring a documentary and cinematic style to every session I have with my clients. ﻿As a quiet queer and a loud LGBTQIA+ advocate—everyone is welcome in front of my lens. My priority is creating a safe space for my clients where they feel they can express themselves freely so I can capture the uniqueness that makes them - them.

I am big on capturing things for what they are. Is it raining on your big day? Your kid won't get on board with family shots? Let's tell the story together. Whether it’s a social gathering, a special celebration, or just the everyday magic of life, I aim to capture genuine emotions and tell your unique story with a touch of artistry. My approach weaves authenticity with creativity, ensuring that your memories are not just documented but beautifully crafted. People are magic - let's capture yours together. One frame at a time.

  * ### THE BEST PHOTOGRAPHER IN THE WORLD

•Verified review

•Shante J.•Nov 8, 2025

If you are looking for a photographer that is patient, kind, professional, and is resonably priced, look no further! Aubrey is the one!!! Me and my husband got married on 9/10/25 at San Fransisco City Hall and it was the greatest day of my life. She and the her business partner , Jessyca, who did a short video for our wedding, was amazing. They both told us how to pose for the perfect pics and they made it so easy. Their work is so amazing and we both are so pleased with the outcome.

  * ### We are so thankful we found her!!!

•Verified review

•Monica E.•Aug 3, 2025

If you're searching for a wedding photographer who doesn't just capture moments, but creates art and effortlessly adapts to your vision, Aubrey Hernandez is the absolute pinnacle. As someone who works in editorial fashion, my standards were high. I spent over a month meticulously reviewing more than 250 photographer portfolios. Finding someone who could deliver a stunning variety of styles and locations was non-negotiable. Aubrey wasn't just a choice; she was the undeniable answer. From our first look at the hotel, Aubrey transformed our anticipation into pure magic. She met us with her team at our hotel for a pre-ceremony shoot, where she captured our first look beautifully. Then she guided us through the vibrant streets of San Francisco as we walked towards our venue, she captured breathtaking, fashion-forward editorial moments with an authenticity that felt effortless. Her eye for unique angles, urban textures, and genuine connection resulted in photos that look like they belong in a high-end magazine – exactly the dynamic, artistic range I desperately wanted. Aubrey's brilliance continued seamlessly at the venue. She masterfully utilized the remaining time before the ceremony to capture heartwarming, natural shots with our friends and family, proving her incredible versatility in shifting from high-fashion editorial to intimate, joyful candids without missing a beat. Throughout the entire wedding night, Aubrey, along with her second shooter and assistant, were an absolute dream team. Their coordination was flawless, ensuring every crucial moment, big and small, was documented from multiple beautiful perspectives. They were everywhere they needed to be, yet never intrusive – a true testament to Aubrey's professionalism and leadership. We received our sneak peek shots within 48 hours and we’re overjoyed with how much we loved every single one. We look forward to seeing the rest of the pictures as they come in In the next couple months. What truly sets Aubrey apart is her distinct artistic voice combined with remarkable flexibility and versatility. Not all artists possess both, but Aubrey does. She understood my vision completely and executed it with grace, creativity, and enthusiasm. Her openness to collaboration and crystal-clear communication throughout the entire process made us feel heard, valued, and completely confident. Choosing Aubrey Hernandez was one of the most significant and worthwhile investments we made for our wedding. She was our largest investment for that day and her work was well worth it. She didn't just take pictures; she crafted a visual narrative of our day that is diverse, deeply emotional, and artistically extraordinary. Her talent is undeniable, her team is superb, and her ability to blend editorial flair with genuine wedding storytelling is simply unmatched. To couples seeking photography that transcends the ordinary, especially those desiring a mix of styles, locations, and pure artistry: Aubrey Hernandez is worth every single penny and then some. She delivered beyond our wildest dreams. Thank you, Aubrey, for your incredible talent, flexibility, and for giving us heirlooms we will cherish forever!

## Frequently asked questions

6 Answers

Ask them a question

### How many pictures will we get?

I don't like to put a number on images delivered for your wedding day (or any long event!) Days all unfold in different ways, and each wedding is incredibly unique! However, you can expect around 40 images per hour of photographing. Keep in mind this estimate varies depending on your wedding package, number of guests, venue type, and other factors.

### Will you edit all our pictures?

Absolutely! All final images will be edited to ensure they look beautiful and in line with my style and portfolio. I also offer retouching services like blemish removal and teeth whitening for an additional charge.

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

My turnaround time varies by season. Typically, you’ll be able to view your photos online about 8 weeks after your wedding. You can also expect next day sneak peeks, so you can share with friends and family right away!

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically, couples book me about 10 months before their wedding date. I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible about my availability, even if you’re planning on a shorter time frame.

### Do you also offer video services?

No, I prefer focusing on photography only, so you can get the best wedding pictures possible. However, I am happy to connect you to some videographers that I trust!

### Do you have insurance?

I do! Just let me know if your venue requires a certificate of liability, and I’ll send that over to them.
