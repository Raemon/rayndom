How to tell you about me in a short paragraph? Ok, here we go - born & raised in Australia, recently American. Currently Aus-Merican. Wife to Spencer (2016), Mum/Mom to Reed (2020), and Milo (2023). Big fan of a latte in the morning and a French75 on special occasions. An avid listener of audiobooks, podcasts, Taylor Swift, my 'Theatre Mix' playlist on Spotify, and early 2000's pop and, occasionally, 2010's emo. A repeat watcher of Bridgerton, New Girl, The Good Place, The Righteous Gemstones, VEEP, & Ted Lasso.

I am passionate about providing exemplary service and crafting exceptional events and memories. I manage my time well, offer unsolicited advice on wedding planning far too often, and will do whatever it takes to pull off an incredible wedding day.

**In three words:** Calm, Efficient, Positive

  * ### Top Tier Coordinator

•Verified review

•Thalia M.•Jan 18

It was such a pleasure working with Claire! As a wedding photographer, nothing makes my job easier and more enjoyable than working with a coordinator who knows their stuff. Clair is so organized and pays close attention to the details, and the more I see of the weddings she works, the more I’d love to work with her again!

  * ### Claire is the best

•Verified review

•Dorothy S.•Oct 18, 2025

The coordinator was the first vendor I searched for, and boy did I search high and low, since I knew that the captain running the ship on the day would have a huge impact on our experience day-of. I talked to almost 20 coordinators, and Claire actually happened to be the first one I had a call with. I immediately felt comfortable chatting with her, and could tell she was very professional and good at what she does. Working with her up to the wedding day was so easy, she was by far the most professional and responsive vendor we worked with. On the day, everything was worry-free and seamless for us, which is an experience we’re so grateful to have had on our wedding day. We felt very well taken care of and like our priorities were really reflected in how the day ran. Also the decorations were stunning!! I couldn’t believe how my vision had been brought to life even better than I had imagined. Thank you to Claire for your support on the day, professionalism, and grounding presence. Our wedding day was perfect, a big thanks to you.

  * ### Claire is your wedding day fairy! 

•Verified review

•Lindsey C.•Mar 10, 2025

I have worked with Claire for over 8 years at multiple venues and seen her shine doing what she loves. There is not a single detail that will go unnoticed with her in charge. Weddings are second nature to her and she is careful to address all logistics beginning to end. Every couple who has hired her as a coordinator loves her and feels as if she is their best friend the day of. She goes above and beyond and will assist with everything she possibly can including (but not limited to) creating and following a sensible timeline, clear communication between vendors and couple family / wedding party, bustling dresses, bringing her emergency supply kit in case ANY unexpected incident should arise, and will manage the day without the client even knowing what is happening behind the scenes. Claire was born to be a coordinator and you will be the best hands with her on your day!

  * ### The best coordinator I have EVER worked with.

•Verified review

•Rachel the P.•Mar 6, 2025

I have worked with Claire for dozens of weddings and events. She even planned a vacation for me, though I don’t think this is a publicly offered service…yet. She thinks through every scenario and has a plan for each one. She keeps the events moving along so you’ll never get behind on your timeline. She’s also super awesome and fun to be around during your event! My favorite story is when the goats got out of their pen, but she totally handled the situation without the couple or any of the guests knowing!
