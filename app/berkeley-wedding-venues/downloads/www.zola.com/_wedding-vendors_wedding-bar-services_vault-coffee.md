  * ### Hands down best coffee!

•Verified review

•Kristina D.•Dec 12, 2025

I’ve been craving another cup of their coffee ever since my first sip. The Vault Coffee team was incredibly friendly, super accommodating, and genuinely easy to work with. Highly recommend their cart for great service and even better coffee!

  * ### Great Coffee and Service 

•Verified review

•Alina•Dec 12, 2025

I had an amazing experience at this coffee cart! The moment I walked up, I was greeted with warm smiles and genuinely friendly service. You can tell the team loves what they do. They take the time to chat, make recommendations, and craft each drink with care. The coffee was outstanding. Rich flavor, perfectly balanced, and made exactly to my liking. My latte was smooth, beautifully prepared, and better than what I get at most cafes. The attention to detail is impressive for a mobile setup. The vibe of the cart is welcoming, efficient, and relaxed the perfect combo whether you’re grabbing a quick cup on the go or lingering for a moment to enjoy the atmosphere.I’ll definitely be coming back. Highly recommend this coffee cart for anyone who appreciates great coffee and exceptional service.

  * ### Best Matcha I’ve Had! 

•Verified review

•Jenny K.•Aug 20, 2025

I usually don’t enjoy matcha, but Vault Coffee completely changed my mind! The iced matcha was so smooth, refreshing, and perfectly balanced—not too sweet and not bitter. The staff was friendly and quick, making it such a great stop for coffee (and now matcha!) on the go. I’ll definitely be coming back for more!
