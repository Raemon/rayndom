•Verified review

•Nicole O.•Oct 3, 2025

Shuman Koutory Event and Design-Planning was a complete disappointment and caused us tremendous stress leading up to our wedding day. Their communication style was inconsistent, disingenuous, and disorganized. Ashli, our florist , cancelled on us a week before the wedding and refused to honor her promise of a full refund within 30 days. After months of follow-ups and false promises, we had to file a claim with AmEx to dispute her charges and finally get our money back. There was no value delivered from this vendor, and we would strongly caution any couple against using their services.

  * ### Great Planner

  * ### Amazing coordinators

•Verified review

•Shalia N.•May 3, 2025

Shuman Koutory Event and Design-Planning were an absolute pleasure to work with for our wedding. From the very beginning, their communication was prompt, open, and honest, and they remained actively engaged throughout the entire planning process. Their team's genuine approach, organizational skills, and attention to detail were invaluable - they jumped right in with no time to waste and executed the day gracefully. It truly felt like they were a part of our family, while still maintaining a professional demeanor. We cannot recommend Shuman Koutory enough to any couple looking for a wedding planning team that will make their special day unforgettable.
