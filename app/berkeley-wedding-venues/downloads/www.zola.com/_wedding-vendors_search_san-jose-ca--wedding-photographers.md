From our very first interaction to the last moments of our wedding day, Enea and Hayley were an absolute dream to work with. They brought such professionalism, kindness, and an incredible eye for detail, which took so much stress off our shoulders and let us enjoy every moment. The photos and videos they created are nothing short of breathtaking. Every smile, tear, and joyful moment was captured in such a beautiful and natural way. Additionally, they provided us with a google drive link of RAW files, which shows just how much they care about giving their clients everything they could want. Enea and Hayley are not just talented; they are artists with a true gift for storytelling. They exceeded every expectation we had, and we’ll treasure their work forever.

They were calm, friendly, and honestly lifesavers during my nervous moments. Our wedding was last November 2023, and the way they captured the sunset at the beach was unreal.

Thalia Moshtagh Photography 5.0 San Jose, CA

  * Photojournalistic style
  * Starts at $4,200 

Hello! I’m so excited for the chance to work with you. I’m a former teacher who has always had a passion for photography. I started working freelance in 2015 and did a lot of my first jobs in the music industry. I shot Warped Tour a few times and even had one of my promos featured by AP magazine. I quickly realized I loved working with couples the most, and now focus on couple and family portraits and weddings!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Thalia saved our wedding. We had to change photographers very last minute and were super worried about hiring someone new. Then we found Thalia and from the moment we had our first intro call with her we had a feeling that everything was going to work out. She was so professional, during our first call she was very well organized and clear about what she would need from us. She took her time to make sure we were a great match and to understand our vision. She was personable and kind, speaking with her felt like talking to a friend right away. She was considerate, during all parts of the wedding she made sure to give us time alone together and we never felt rushed. Even still she constantly captured the most breath taking photos. Lastly she was so much fun! Our guests loved her and thought she had the most wonderful energy. She directed us very well. Looking over the pictures I’ve never felt so beautiful. She even brought her own props to go with our theme for the pictures. A vintage camera and tray. Everything she did was so thoughtful. I wish we could have another wedding just to have her photograph it. You will not regret working with Thalia.

She makes everyone she meets feel comfortable, confident and beautiful in their pictures!

Sean Wash Photo 5.0 San Jose, CA

Hi there! I'm Sean, a Bay Area native who is pretty darn handy with a camera. I started my professional photography journey during the pandemic after losing my job working in STEM and Art Education. I decided to bet on myself and pursue my passion, which is to be a full-time photographer. What excites me most about being a photographer is the opportunity to create incredible art with amazing people. I love meeting new people and connecting with them. Wedding photography is so fulfilling because it requires so much trust, and seeing the joy from couples when they see their photos is truly magical.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“I am usually very camera shy but Sean made our Engagement photo shoot so fun and easy. He was extremely professional and I am soooo beyond amazed with the outcome of the photos. Sean was present during our proposal and I did not even notice him there! He captured this special moment for us and we now have beautiful photos forever. Looking back at the photos is like reliving the joy in that moment.”Valerie H., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/sean-wash-photo)

Ripple Rain Photography 5.0 San Jose, CA

  * Photojournalistic style

The moments you remember most aren’t usually the ones that were planned. My approach is documentary-driven and unhurried, focused on connection, movement, and the quiet in-between moments that tend to mean the most later. I work best with couples who value presence over perfection and want images that feel honest, intimate, and timeless. Whether your day is big or small, traditional or unconventional, my goal is to create space for you to be fully yourselves — and to tell your story as it naturally unfolds.“Sharyce is without a doubt one of the best humans to have part of your wedding day. She is calm and collected and gets her stuff done with ease. We are so lucky to have found her and shared our day with her. Our photos are beautiful and they’re only just the sneak peaks so far! My wife and I are so excited to sit together in a few months from now and reminisce on all of the lifelong memories Sharyce captured for us”Noelle, 3 days ago![](https://images.zola.com/9b042c5e-ffdf-4fd3-a75b-a8821476340d?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/ripple-rain-photography)

My name is Brittani and photography is my ARTlet. Inspired by the constant flow of love and energy of the world, I photograph people who value authenticity and connection. I reside in San Jose, but with the heart of the adventurer, I'm always ready to grab my backpack and go.“Brittani is an amazing photographer and a gem to work with. She is truly passionate about her craft, but at the same time made us feel at ease during our engagement and wedding shoots. She was instrumental in helping us plan our wedding timeline and keeping us on track during that chaotic day. She was totally game to hike down several secluded beach trails to get us the perfect shots. We love how she captured our special day, and plan to use her again in the future.

Obsessed with weddings that FEEL better than they look! I jump in right away to help build out a stress free and relaxed timeline to ensure you truly enjoy your day. With a natural and organic approach to lighting and posing it's important to me that you have images that capture your happiness and all the emotions! Country music, dirt roads, camping, plants and breakfast anytime of day makes my heart happy. I love turning everyday life into an adventure!“Quianna shot my engagement photos and wedding and I could not be happier with my photos and the overall experience! Quianna is an absolute master of her craft and has a serious love for photographing weddings that shines through in every interaction you have with her. My fiancé and I are not the most comfortable in front of the camera but I guarantee if you were an outsider looking in on our engagement/wedding shoots you would think we had done this a million times before! Quianna does an amazing job of providing direction on how to pose and her positive feedback and exclamations like "magic is happening!" made us feel so comfortable. We couldn't believe we actually had FUN taking so much many pictures and its all thanks to her. I could go on and on about how much I love Quianna and 100% recommend her for any photography needs. You will love your photos and also love her spirit! Thank you again Quianna!”Lindsey + D., 5 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/quianna-marie-photography)

Sarah Luther Photography 5.0 San Jose, CA

Hi, nice to meet you! I'm Sarah from Sarah Luther Photography. I specialize in weddings, family portraits and event photography. I started Sarah Luther Photography out of a passion for capturing love and emotion through photography. Growing up, my mom would always take tons of family pictures. I was given a camera as a gift when I was 10 years old and haven't been without one since. :)“Sarah and her husband Ori photographed our wedding in July and we couldn't be happier with our photos. They make a great team, professional and easy to work with. Amazing photographers who love what they do and its evident in their photos. We wanted more candid, natural pictures opposed to posed ones. They got so many unexpected moments and memorable shots. From getting ready, to the ceremony, to dancing at the receptions and everything in-between. All without even knowing that they were there taking pictures. We were so happy that we chose Sarah as our photographer and you will too!!! Thank You Sarah and Ori for photographing our wedding!!!

I'm a big fan of movies and I love to bring that aesthetic with all its beautiful framing, its light and shadows and moody hues, into my work. My photography style is a mix of creative documentary and fine art portraiture with a touch of that cinematic esthetic. I shoot a mixture of artistic portraits alongside reportage-style candids that are full of emotion throughout the wedding day. I do my best work when I feel an honest connection with my couples, allowing them to open up in front of the camera and truly be themselves.](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/katherine-bree-walker-photography)

  * Serves San Jose, CA

Professional and passionate, I pride myself on providing high quality services and experiences for my clients. I believe in easy and open communication with couples and want to capture what makes your love story yours.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We 100% recommend Shelby for any of your event or wedding needs (and everything in between). We hired Shelby to photograph our post-elopement family celebration/party, and while I was worried about finding a photographer who would be willing to work outside the box and be flexible for our needs, she put my fears absolutely to rest. She was warm, kind, professional, and clear in all of her communication, over email and in person. During our party, she was friendly and put our guests at ease. A day or two after the event she provided a photo highlight preview, so we got to see some photos almost immediately (so appreciated) — the final photos we received were absolutely beautiful and reflected her attention to detail and her ability to see and capture so many of those sweet candid moments you only get when all of your people are in one place. We will absolutely be contacting her again, next chance we get!”Katherine G., a year ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/shelby-ann-foto)
