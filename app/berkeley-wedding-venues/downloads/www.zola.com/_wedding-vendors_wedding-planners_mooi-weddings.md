MOOI is an eclectic team of planners, designers, stylists, producers, photographers, makers and artists. We have over a decade of experience planning weddings and events in the Bay Area and the Central coast. We have a vast network of amazingly creative vendors and venues to share with you. We have a non traditional approach to weddings and make the planning process easy and fun! Nothing is obliged and everything is possible. We have tons of experience with blended couples and the challenges and gifts of combining the richness of two cultures. We believe everyone deserves a planner, so will take on weddings in all budgets!

Designing a wedding is more than just copying your favorite Pinterest ideas. As designers our main goal is to translate the true identity of the couple in the design of the event. We love meaningful touches that tell stories. We love surprise performances. We’d love including the talents of your friends and family. We want to learn about the songs that make your cry, that last trip you took together, your first date. We love all forms of art, be it: visual, audio, three dimensional or graphic. We love textures, backdrops and tiny little secrets. Ideally you will look back at your wedding and think: this was so ‘us’.

**In three words:** Calm, Collaborative, Positive

  * ### Linda was an amazing!!! [Month of coordinator]

•Verified review

•Johns G.•Sep 25, 2024

We are so so happy and blessed with how our wedding turned out. Linda was a big part of thinking through all of the ideas that my partner and I had. She also was very professional and skilled at dealing with some tense moments and negotiations with a venue that we had picked out before hiring Linda. At all moments, we felt very strongly that Linda was personally invested in making our wedding day special - from thinking through so many details ahead of time to making small adjustments to decorations and tables throughout the wedding.

  * ### Linda and Mooi are the best!

•Verified review

•Kanchan G.•Jan 11, 2024

We reached out to Mooi after a friend recommended them to us. We were looking for the month of coordination help rather than full wedding planning, and Mooi offered services for exactly what we needed. We worked with Linda for our 10/2023 wedding and she was excellent! She was exceptionally organized and gave us great feedback and very detailed timeline and checklists for vendors and family. Our wedding was at one of the East Bay regional parks, which came with some challenges and limitations that come with getting married in a public space. Linda Saskia were super helpful in working through those challenges and making sure the day of our wedding went as smoothly as possible and stayed on schedule. They were also extremely helpful in finding great vendors and extra help for us. I was especially grateful when we had one vendor drop off on us last minute and Saskia was able to find a replacement just a few days before the wedding. Would highly recommend using both Mooi and Linda, they were such a delight to work with!

  * ### Hire Saskia and you won’t regret it!

•Verified review

•Ailsa M.•Jan 1, 2024

Saskia is absolutely phenomenal. We had hired her for weekend of coordination but about six weeks before had a family emergency that made it necessary to have more of her help. She stepped in fully and helped us SO much to still be able to execute our wedding. She has such keen attention to detail while not losing sight of an overall vision. We felt like she just understood what we wanted and just “got it”. We could not have asked for someone more lovely and easy to work with. She helped us plan every detail for our camp wedding at OVY in San Gregorio. Her staff were amazing to work with as well. We cannot recommend her highly enough!!

  * ### Can't recommend Mooi enough!!

•Verified review

•Olivia H.•Dec 2, 2023

We reached out to Mooi for month-of-coordination for our wedding at OVY Camp, who listed them as a recommended vendor. We're so glad we did. Saskia was thorough, attentive, and communicative leading up to the event to best understand the vision and materials we'd planned for the weekend. Her input was invaluable due to Mooi's familiarity with OVY Camp, and in identifying the areas of preparation that we'd overlooked. Saskia's recommendations and coordination on the day of made all the difference. It allowed us (and our parents!) to be present and fully enjoy our wedding day we spent so much time planning for. We can't thank Saskia and her staff enough for helping to create a day we'll remember for the rest of our lives.

## Frequently asked questions

5 Answers

Ask them a question

### Do you offer Day Of Coordination only?

The smallest package we offer is the Month Of coordination package. 10 + years of experience in planning gorgeous events has taught us that doing an amazing job on your wedding day requires a certain amount of prep time invested by your coordinator. The timeline meeting, site visit, vendor calls, rehearsal, all of those are necessary to be well prepared and completely in charge on the wedding day. Our planners spend a month studying your wedding, tying loose ends and fixing potential snags even before the wedding day. They won't be tapping you on the shoulder with questions on your day, so you and yours can just relax and and celebrate!

### How big is your team on the wedding day?

Our Month Of Coordination Package includes a planner and an assistant for up to 12 hours. Depending on your set up and the amount of time we have for set up, we may need to bring a larger team. Your Coordinator will assess this once we have all the details about set up. Some weddings we've had teams of 8 people, some we have only 1! If you are working with a non full service catering company like a food truck or a food drop, MOOI can put together a catering team for you including servers, a FOH manager and bartenders.

### Are you part of a team? Who will we be working with?

Yes! MOOI is a collaborative of creatives, planners, producers and designers. Once you inquire we will find your perfect match within our amazingly talented team. We all have our specialties and we all support each other. Each wedding is a team effort but you will have one point of contact throughout the process who will be by your side on your wedding day as well. The biggest advantage of working with a collective like MOOI is that your resources just multiplied by 6! Our combined experience and network is so very valuable. In addition you do not have to worry about your planner getting sick or injured as we have each others back!

### Do you also plan other events, like showers or rehearsal dinners?

Yup. We can plan anything you'd like! No matter how big or small the event. Feel free to contact us with your ideas and vision.

### Do you plan Celebration of Life?

Yes, whilst not advertised as much on our website, we do take on a couple of celebrations of life a year. These collaborations have our hearts and we feel honored to help grieving families create a beautiful goodbye for their loved ones. For celebrations of life we offer full planning and design only, starting at 10K. Grieving can be all encompassing and we believe that fully delegating all logistics whilst staying involved in the overall experience is what is best for a family. In our design and the curated experience we emphasize the personality and passions of the person who has passed, creating a uniquely personal event.
