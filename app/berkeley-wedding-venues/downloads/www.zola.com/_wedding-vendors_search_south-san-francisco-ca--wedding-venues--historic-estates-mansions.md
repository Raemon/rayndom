![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Hola, yo no soy de escribir reseñas pero en esta ocasión amerita hacerlo, si pudiera le diera 100 estrellas a Suisun Valley Inn. Desde el primer día que fuimos a conocer las instalaciones, el señor Gary fue muy atento y respetuoso, contestó a todas nuestras dudas. Tal vez nuestro evento fue algo fuera de lo común, a diferencia de los eventos de boda que se organizan aquí, nosotros contratamos el granero para el 25 de Diciembre para celebrar los 15 años de mi hija , sabemos que son días festivos donde la gente está con su familia , más sin embargo recibimos todo su apoyo para que el evento se hiciera realidad en este día tan especial , puedo decirles que fue una experiencia maravillosa, fue en evento de ensueño y de igual manera nos hospedamos en la casa, donde realmente nos sentimos como en nuestro hogar , sinceramente todas las instalaciones estuvieron limpias en todo momento, Gary estuvo al pendiente de si necesitábamos algo y al igual si la empresa que contratamos para la planeación necesitaban apoyo. Quiero animar a todos los papás que deseen hacerle su quinceañera a su hija, que consideren contratar los servicios de Suisun Valley Inn, ya que harán que su hija viva una experiencia única y de ensueño, no se arrepentirán. Sr Gary agradezco todas sus atenciones y muy pronto estaremos trabajando con usted para los 15 años de mi otra hija… Bendiciones”Fabiola M., 22 days ago![](https://images.zola.com/0dbc73ce-706c-4f4e-8b41-7324823426c8?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/suisun-valley-inn-at-monroe-ranch)

“We loved the idea of booking a reception venue that already had an incredible staff in-house. GAMH provided us with great care and kind but honest input every step of the way. The event coordinator (the fabulous Mandy!), audio, lighting, catering, servers, bar service, coat check…..was perfection because the team is their own and prideful for the space and its legendary music history. It was special to introduce so many out-of-town guests to this beautiful classic of a venue in the heart of our city and dance the night away. We’ll never forget it and will enjoy attending shows that much more forever.”Emily R., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/great-american-music-hall)

“A family of 40 friends and relatives celebrated the life of a beloved family member who passed. Finca Montara helped find a bi-lingual non-denominational pastor, and a harpist for uplifting music. The comfortable antique pews and chairs added a lovely ambiance. Afterwards, we adjourned to the house for a buffet, toasts to the departed, and family unity. Altogether a wonderful experience! Highly recommended for weddings and renewal of vows as well as commemorations.”Barbara K., 5 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/finca-montara)

“We hosted our wedding at the Presidio Officers' Club and had truly the most special, incredible day of our lives. It was clean, well-organized, with delicious food and friendly staff. Not to mention, the planning team at the Presidio, through Wedgewood Weddings, was truly best-in-class. Wedgewood prepared us so well, providing a planning binder and step-by-step instructions. They checked in with us multiple times, providing walk-throughs, and answering every question extremely promptly. We especially loved our planner and day-of coordinator, Christian, who went out of his way to make everything so seamless. Christian taught us how to do our ceremony, including little details such as hand placement, went out of his way to accommodate a creative painting engagement, and provided private time for us newlyweds. He was perfect! So grateful to this beautiful venue and our wonderful team. We will treasure our experience with Wedgewood forever.”Natasha H., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/4ee55ad9-e863-4cba-a1fb-b459a421b4da?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/officers-club-at-the-presidio)

“The Terrace Room was the perfect venue for our wedding day. From the very beginning, the staff, especially Candi and Bryon, were friendly, simple, quick, and incredibly helpful in planning our wedding all the way from Paris. They gave us great tips on vendors that really helped make our day magical. The venue itself is beautiful, with a lovely art deco style that felt elegant and unique. Our guests raved about the gorgeous space, the friendly staff (bar tenders, ...), and how well everything came together to make our wedding day truly perfect. We couldn't be happier with The Terrace Room and highly recommend it to any couple looking for a stunning, stress-free wedding experience.”Cécile E., a month ago![](https://images.zola.com/9768bad4-fae6-47f7-b78a-a75d617dee29?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-terrace-room)

“(Review for catering/events/venue service) I don’t have enough great words for Nicole and her team at Berkeley City Club. I planned my wedding entirely “remotely” from out of state and Nicole was always ready to answer my millions of questions and make sure everything was being planned to perfection. I had actually never seen the hotel in person, and I must say the architecture, foliage, vibes, etc are better and MORE stunning in person than in photos. Truly a breathtaking venue that transports you with its historic arches, details, etc. Wedding food is often lackluster in my experience, but I was thoroughly impressed by all of the plated dinner dishes we were served. My salmon was perfectly cooked and guests complimented their meals as well. They were also able to accommodate all gluten free food as I have celiac disease, which was the cherry on top. Additionally, a special shout out to the staff who worked the event day-of. Everyone was kind with bright smiles, and treated me and everything/everyone else with care.”Mariana S., 3 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/berkeley-city-club)

The Faculty Club 5.0 Berkeley, CA

  * Up to 220 guests
  * All-inclusive
  * Indoor & outdoor

Built in 1902 by the renowned architect Bernard Maybeck in traditional Arts and Crafts style, it's designed to create a cozy, intimate feeling. The crowning glory of the club is the three-story Great Hall. With its vaulted ceiling, massive stone fireplace, and stained-glass windows featuring heraldic crests of the great universities of the world, it's reminiscent of many a European cathedral. Light from the floor-to-ceiling windows warms the redwood paneling and suffuses the Hall in a golden glow. Two charming smaller spaces are also available for functions. The Heyns and Seaborg rooms (named respectively after a chancellor and a distinguished University Nobel Laureate) both have French doors leading to a private outdoor area with a garden view. The Faculty Club has been serving its members and guests for over 100 years and will do everything possible to make your event successful and enjoyable.Why you'll love this venue

“We loved working with our Hacienda De Las Flores team for our wedding! Johnny was our day of coordinator wand was wonderful. With our schedules being so busy we could not imagine planning this wedding without the WW team which for us took care of most things for us (food, decor, drinks, DJ). We appreciated the planning materials, binder, meetings which helped keep us on track. As my sister joked even if we did nothing, the wedding would still be great! We went with the recommended florist (A love is in bloom) and bakery (Old towne danville) and thought both were wonderful. We did chose our own Officiant and Photographer however. The venue is gorgeous and the weather thankfully cooperated for a beautiful early fall day. They were great about working with us and our decor ideas and playlist ideas. We loved our wedding! The only downside to be aware of is the noise ordinance which prevents use of microphones in the outdoor patio during reception (only pre-recorded sound/speech is ok). this was not ideal but we knew this was the case when we booked the venue because it is that gorgeous. We did speeches indoors in the dance hall which worked out fine though not ideal. We also had a tiny sound mishap during our grand entrance due to the pre-recorded nature of things but overall not a big deal. Overall think this venue is awesome and would recommend though of course depends on what's most important to you!”Vira F., 3 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/hacienda-de-las-flores-by-wedgewood-weddings)

“Having our wedding at The San Francisco Theological Seminary was one of the easiest and best decisions we made when planning for our wedding! As soon as we stepped foot on the campus, we knew it was the venue we’d been looking for. Working with the staff here (big thank you to Jeremiah Jenkins!!) was low stress and straightforward. Many other venues we looked at just didn’t feel right and felt overly complicated. The grounds were beautifully rich with history and architecture and more than we could have asked for in a wedding venue.”Heather H., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/bb5b98cb-d8fa-4d6a-8fec-561973d2b369?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/university-of-redlands-marin-campus)

![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“My husband and I just got married at Jefferson Street Mansion and it was the most perfect wedding we could have ever imagined - it exceeded our vision! The whole JSM team was so amazing to work with and made planning as stress-free as possible. We stuck to the planning timeline they provided in the planning binder (which was SO helpful to have) and had everything ready in time. Our guests all raved about what a fabulous wedding it was. We customized the venue quite a bit bringing in our own decor and personal touches and it did not feel cookie-cutter at all even though it is an all-inclusive venue. I am so happy we chose JSM!! The recommended vendors were all outstanding, the food was delicious, everything ran smoothly during the wedding and I didn't have to stress about a thing. The mansion, ceremony area, and reception tent are all BEAUTIFUL. I could not have asked for a more perfect day.”Alexandra H., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/1cb206fc-f347-4815-84a4-94dca8dc013d?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/jefferson-street-mansion-by-wedgewood-weddings)

![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Stunning 100+ year old house, was home to one of the original wine pioneers of the region. Gardens are beautiful, perfect setting for 100 person event or smaller more intimate gatherings in the home. Affordable from every perspective, it is permitted to bring in your own beverages, catering and other vendors which saves a bunch! Most venues require the renters to use their vendors and buy their beverages which adds up to a lot, quickly. We used Wine Country Paella who were so amazing! Hidden gem, new management who are great to work with. Unlikely to be hidden for much longer.”Richard Lexington IV, 4 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-maysonnave-house)

Chez Serendip 5.0 Scotts Valley, CA

  * Up to 100 guests
  * All-inclusive
  * Outdoor & indoor
  * Starts at $4,000 

Chez Serendip is an estate and regenerative farm nestled in the Santa Cruz Mountains, designed for intimate, intentional weddings rooted in beauty, nature, and connection. Centered around a lovingly restored 1928 Carriage House, the six-acre property brings together old-growth redwoods, oak trees, gardens, barns, working land, and a 36-foot geodesic dome to create a setting that feels warm, soulful, and alive. Weddings are private, full-property experiences, allowing couples and their guests to be fully immersed in the land over time. We host a limited number of weddings each year to preserve the land and the quality of the experience. Couples are often drawn here for the blend of historic charm, art, music, and natural beauty. Horses, gardens, and space for movement and celebration create an experience that feels expressive rather than staged. Chez Serendip is best suited for those seeking meaning over spectacle, intimacy over scale, and a wedding held by story, land, and heart.Why you'll love this venue

“I rented the Tomales Town Hall for my fiftieth birthday. There was torrential rain outside but the hall was warm and cozy. We had an eight-piece band up on the stage and they sounded fantastic with the acoustics in the room. We had an area cleared up front for dancing and the small round tables in the back with tablecloths and electric candles on them. We served wine and beer from the bar. Much fun was had by all!”Lisa, 4 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/tomales-town-hall)

“The Hollins House is truly a dream come true. The venue itself is stunning— you don’t need to do much to make it the perfect setting for a wedding. Giselle and Bella, the event coordinators, were incredible. From our in-person meetings to email correspondence, they were always helpful, attentive, and on top of every detail. On the big day, I didn’t have to worry about a thing because I knew they had it all handled. The food was absolutely delicious and all our guests couldn’t stop raving about it! The chicken and waffle appetizer during the cocktail hour was a huge hit and the ham benedict was equally loved by everyone. Everything was simply beautiful, and I couldn’t have imagined a better wedding experience. If you’re looking for a venue that combines breathtaking views with exceptional service and cuisine, look no further than Hollins House!”Sarah J., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/69660c71-69e2-4cbd-8459-22eb642d794c?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-hollins-house)

## About wedding venues in South San Francisco, CA

### 

California offers an incredible 840 miles of coastline, 3,000+ wineries and ancient redwoods for your wedding day. When you choose the Golden State, you're getting exceptional natural lighting for your ceremony across diverse settings from Mediterranean coastal zones to alpine mountain backdrops. Each region has its own distinctive character that can perfectly match your vision.

### What Makes California Wedding Venues So Special?

Northern California's Napa Valley welcomes you with rolling vineyards and Spanish colonial architecture where intimate wine cave ceremonies create unforgettable moments. Head to Southern California and you'll find oceanfront venues like Duke's Malibu where you can exchange vows with the Pacific stretching out behind you while enjoying fresh coastal-inspired cuisine. Palm Springs offers dramatic desert venues with mountain backdrops and striking midcentury modern architecture that photographs beautifully.

### How Much Do Wedding Venues in California Cost?

Wedding venues in California typically run between $9,600 and $11,700 which aligns nicely with the national range of $6,500-$12,000. This represents about 18% of your total wedding budget. Your overall costs will vary based on guest count:
