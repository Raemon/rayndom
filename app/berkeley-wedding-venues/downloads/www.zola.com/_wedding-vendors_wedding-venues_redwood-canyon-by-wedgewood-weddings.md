•Verified review

•Emily G.•Oct 6, 2025

We had our wedding at Redwood Canyon by Wedgewood Weddings, and everything about the day was stress-free and seamless. The staff went above and beyond to make sure every detail was handled perfectly. The venue itself was spotless and beautifully maintained—the ceremony area was lush and green with flowers still in bloom, and the newly remodeled reception space looked amazing. The chandeliers and fresh updates were a huge upgrade and really elevated the atmosphere. A special thank-you to Liv (our coordinator) for keeping everything organized and easy, Jovany (our banquet captain) for running the reception flawlessly, Adriona and Aleece (our bartenders) for keeping everyone happy and the drinks flowing, Mark (our DJ) for keeping the energy up all night, and Chef Steven for the incredible food. We had prime rib, salmon, and chicken, and every single guest commented on how great the meal was. Communication with the Wedgewood team throughout the planning process was smooth, and they really listened to what we wanted. We couldn’t have asked for a better experience — highly recommend Redwood Canyon Wedgewood to any couple looking for a stress-free, beautiful wedding day.

•MB•Sep 2, 2025

My partner and I had our wedding at Redwood Canyon by Wedgewood Weddings, and we couldn't be happier with our choice. From our very first interaction to the final moments of our big day, the entire team was exceptional. The planning process was smooth and pleasant, thanks in large part to team members like Jacoby. They were always friendly, responsive, and made everything feel easy and stress-free. On the day of the wedding, the service was absolutely flawless. Our coordinator, Ana, was a dream to work with. She was incredibly organized and attentive, ensuring every detail was perfect and that the entire day flowed seamlessly. We truly felt so taken care of and genuinely cared for. The banquet captain, Jovany, and his team were also phenomenal. They provided outstanding service to us and our guests, making sure everyone was happy and comfortable. We also received many compliments from our guests about how delicious everything the appetizers were. If you are looking for a great venue with a top-notch team that will go above and beyond to make your wedding day perfect, we wholeheartedly recommend Redwood Canyon by Wedgewood Weddings. They helped us plan a great wedding in a very short amount of time!
