Hello! My name is Cynthia Bui and I’d like to welcome you to my portfolio. In love with love and the stories behind each couple, I design fun-filled events that combine creativity, personal details, and well-planned logistics. I am here to take care of my clients, to listen to their stories, and create an event that brings their vision to reality. During the day of the wedding, I will ensure that I’ve created a beautiful and flawless day for the couple and their guests. I offer full and partial wedding planning & design services. I am located in the Bay Area but I would love to travel anywhere for your love story.

My experience with weddings make me truly believe that weddings are the live story telling of couples. A wedding should portray the couple’s story combining lots of creativity, personal details, and just pure joy. Since no two weddings will ever be identical, I create events that are inspired by their love and highlight the uniqueness of each couple. My travels have also inspired me to learn more about different wedding cultures of other countries. This has helped me incorporate different cultures and traditions into one grand event.

**In three words:** Creative, Organized, Thoughtful

  * ### Cynthia is the best!

•Verified review

•Jonny H.•Dec 15, 2025

Cynthia is amazing! When we decided it was time to start planning our wedding, we had no idea where to even begin. As a full-service planner, Cynthia guided us through the entire process, creating a comprehensive timeline for us to work off of and outlining all the major steps and deadlines. She did research on venues, submitted vendor proposals, provided options on decor and advice about other stylistic choices, and oversaw vendor outreach and coordination. We met regularly, which helped soothe our nerves, and Cynthia fielded all the questions and requests that we had with patience and kindness. She also responded very quickly to our questions by email or text. As we got closer to the big day, she walked us through everything during our rehearsal, and on the day of the wedding, she worked behind the scenes to ensure that everything ran smoothly. And on top of all this, Cynthia always kept a positive, upbeat attitude that helped keep us going even when things got stressful. When all was said and done, our big day went off without a hitch, and it was all thanks to Cynthia!

  * ### So grateful for Cynthia’s expertise!

•Verified review

•The S.•Nov 30, 2025

During the wedding planning, Cynthia was always there for us, keeping us in the loop, and making sure we had the info we needed via text or email. We hired Cynthia to help us with our tea ceremony and wedding - her assistance with both truly made our dream wedding come true! Planning a wedding alone is stressful, but adding a tea ceremony where you have to juggle the nuances of tradition, timing, and cultural significance can be overwhelming. Cynthia's expertise and meticulous attention to detail ensured that everything went smoothly, allowing us to fully enjoy our special day(s) without any worries. One thing that really stood out about working with Cynthia was her experience and how she went the extra mile. Even though we only hired her for partial planning, she regularly checked in to offer advice and support. On our big day, she handled last-minute changes like a pro. While we had a big say in how our wedding looked and managing our budget, Cynthia took our ideas and made them happen. She made sure everything ran smoothly by staying in touch with our vendors and paying attention to the details. Despite her being pregnant during our wedding planning (and having her baby!), Cynthia never missed a beat. She worked closely with our vendors, ensuring everything came together seamlessly. Cynthia's knack for organization was impressive. She kept track of all the details, making sure everything was checked off the list during our meetings. On the day of the wedding, Cynthia and her assistant did an incredible job organizing our wedding. They handled everything from setting up including guest tables, wedding signs, and dessert displays (and so much more). Despite our attempts to organize the items beforehand, their workload was huge, but Cynthia managed it all efficiently. She even helped pack up afterward - relieving us of any cleanup worries. We're incredibly grateful for her dedication and exceptional service, which went above and beyond what we expected. Overall, Cynthia exceeded our expectations with her professionalism and attention to detail. We couldn't have asked for a better wedding planner. Lucy & Ryan

  * ### Couldn’t Have Done It Without Cynthia!

•Verified review

•Ivy & T.•Aug 6, 2025

We are so grateful we had Cynthia as our wedding coordinator! We had a small, intimate wedding of about 30 people in the redwoods of Oakland—and despite it raining in the middle of July, which we did not anticipate at all, Cynthia and her team handled everything with such grace and made the day feel seamless and beautiful. From the start, Cynthia was incredibly organized and helped keep us on track with her detailed Google Sheet (a true lifesaver). I had a loose vision of how I wanted everything to look and feel, but Cynthia took that vision and brought it to life in a way that was even better than I could’ve imagined. Her eye for detail, calm energy, and years of experience were so reassuring throughout the whole planning process. One of the things I love most that Cynthia said to us was that her approach to weddings is like throwing a fancy dinner party for you and your loved ones—and that really captured how the day felt. It was intentional, warm, personal, and still beautifully executed. She was always available to answer our (many) questions, had great advice when we were feeling uncertain, and recommended amazing vendors we ended up loving. Cynthia is someone you can fully trust to make your day go smoothly, and to make sure it reflects you as a couple. We feel incredibly lucky to have worked with her and would recommend her to anyone looking for a thoughtful, organized, and experienced coordinator who truly cares.

  * ### Fantastic wedding coordinator & services!

•Verified review

•Kristine Y.•Aug 3, 2025

Cynthia came to us as a recommendation from another friend who used her for their wedding. She was fantastic to work with. From the very beginning, she were extremely communicative, organized, and helpful in guiding us through the planning process. Cynthia's attention to detail and thoughtful approach ensured that every element of our special day was executed flawlessly. Cynthia and her team were incredibly proactive, anticipating our needs and making sure everything ran smoothly behind the scenes the day of the wedding. We had a packed wedding agenda too with 2 venues (church and restaurant) and 4 different events (door games, church ceremony, tea ceremony, and reception). Cynthia and her team took meticulous care in helping us set up all the beautiful decor, answered questions for the restaurant staff, and helped us with breaking down the wedding. We are so grateful to Cynthia for helping make our wedding day truly unforgettable. Highly would recommend her!
