  * ### Jimmy is the best!

•Verified review

•McAuley•Oct 21, 2024

We had the best experience working with Jimmy for our wedding day! He made us both feel so comfortable in front of the camera and captured the most beautiful moments. He’s so reliable and really delivered a thoughtful and sentimental video. So grateful we got to meet him and have him be an integral part of our day!

Response from vendor•Oct 23, 2024

Thank you so much for your kind words, McAuley and Danny! It was an absolute honor to be part of your special day and capture those precious moments for you. I’m grateful to have been a part of your celebration, and I wish you both a lifetime of love and happiness! Thank you again for trusting me with your wedding memories!

  * ### HIRE HIM! BEST MONEY YOU’LL SPEND 

•Verified review

•Danie W.•Aug 19, 2024

I looked at SO MANY wedding videos and they were all so similar and cookie cutter. They were lacking something but I couldn’t put my finger on it. THEN I FOUND JIMMY SHIN. I watched his videos and found myself sobbing at strangers videos! He made me feel like I knew the bride and groom after just 7 minutes. He's so good! Jimmy will take your wedding video and turn it into the most beautiful story. The video he made for us just so beautifully captured my husband and I's day! It's a video i'll cherish for the rest of my life. I can't wait for our kids to be able to watch it. UGH, seriously hire this man and you won't regret it. Best wedding money we spent. https://www.youtube.com/watch?viVAKZzODr6E

Response from vendor•Oct 17, 2024

Wow, I’m truly blown away by your kind words, Danie! Knowing that you’ll cherish it for a lifetime, and even share it with your future kids, is just the greatest compliment I could receive. It was an honor to be a part of your special day—thank you for trusting me! Wishing you and Adam a lifetime of happiness, and thank you again for such an amazing review!

  * ### The Best Videographer You Could Ask For

•Verified review

•Tara C.•Jul 21, 2024

Jimmy Shin is simply phenomenal! From start to finish, Jimmy made us feel incredibly comfortable and at ease. His ability to blend into the background and capture the most natural, beautiful moments on video is truly a talent. There were times we completely forgot he was there, and that’s a testament to his unobtrusive and effortless style. Jimmy’s work never felt staged or forced; instead, he captured the genuine emotions and spontaneous joy of our special day. Our wedding video tells a story and brings us right back to those cherished moments. His professionalism and dedication are unmatched, and he went above and beyond to ensure everything was perfect. We can’t recommend Jimmy enough. If you’re looking for a videographer who is not only incredibly skilled but also a pleasure to work with, look no further than Jimmy Shin. Thank you, Jimmy, for making our wedding day unforgettable!

Response from vendor•Jul 22, 2024

## Frequently asked questions

6 Answers

Ask them a question

### Do you offer any other films besides the highlight film?

Yes! We offer a few different add-on films, which you can find on our services page. Our most popular add-ons include the “FOMO Reel” and the “Ceremony Film.” The “FOMO Reel” includes every piece of footage we captured from your day. We’ll stabilize the videos and create a compilation film for you, so you don't have to navigate a file of shaky and/or duplicated clips. The “Ceremony Film” is a 15-30 minute recording of your ceremony. 

### Can we get the raw footage?

We’ll weave together the most meaningful, surprising, entertaining, and delightful moments of your day to craft a compelling narrative. You can request raw footage as an add-on to your order if you’d like to have the full recording. 

### Do you choose the music?

Yes, we choose the music for a few different reasons. The number one reason is pacing. I choose music that matches the pace and narrative arc of your film. A mismatch between these elements can result in an awkward film that doesn’t properly communicate a single emotion or feels dated after a few years. The second reason is that we have to license all the music we use to avoid copyright issues and/or lawsuits. Lastly, I'll choose music that matches the vibe of your wedding and the personalities of the attendees to create a timeless film you’ll be proud to rewatch for generations.

### Do I need an expensive wedding for the film to look good?

Not at all! Our films focus more on the people involved and the stories you share, so you don’t need to worry about expensive bouquets or venues. However you’ve chosen to spend your day will be enough to create a beautiful, memory-packed film. 

### Aren’t wedding videos cringey? Will I really watch it?

Cheap and inexperienced videographers can certainly create “cringey” videos that you may regret investing in. It’s always important to feel a connection to a videographer’s work before deciding to have them capture your wedding. If you liked our portfolio pieces, you’ll absolutely be happy with what we create together. Many of the couples we’ve worked with have told us that watching their wedding film has become an anniversary tradition. The same could be true for you! 

### Won’t I look awkward on film if I’ve never done this before? 

I will help make sure you’re comfortable and confident throughout the entire filming process. we may step in to provide tips, but otherwise, you’ll hardly even notice we’re there. All you have to do is experience your day in all its magic. We’ll capture candid shots and genuine emotions that you’ll be happy to remember in the future.
