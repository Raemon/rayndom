“My husband and I chose to have our wedding reception (170 guests) at Fogo de Chão in Santana Row, and we highly recommend it for anyone else considering a restaurant as a venue for a wedding reception. We were already familiar with both the Fogo de Chão San Francisco and Santana Row locations as we had dined at these two locations a few times prior to the wedding (both for date night and family outings). Each time the service was fantastic, so it was an easy choice for the both of us to make. I've assisted in planning wedding receptions for other family members and friends with various, typical, non-restaurant wedding reception venues, each and every time a different headache, so my husband and I knew for sure that choosing a restaurant would be the best choice. The Fogo de Chão team delivered and provided the easiest planning experience by far. Leo and Yelena provided us with timely updates, kept communication open, and kindly received and efficiently executed all of our requests. The night of our reception greatly exceeded our expectations. Fogo de Chão is a beautiful restaurant as is so very, very minimal decorations were needed. The quality of our dinner and service felt so luxurious. The staff was warm, highly attentive and catered to all of our guests' needs; we even had our own designated server for our sweetheart table. From the moment we inquired, all the way to the end of our wedding reception, Leo, Yelena, and the entire Fogo de Chão team made our experience extremely effortless, seamless, and memorable! Our guests to this day still rave about how delicious everything was, and the great time that they had! My husband and I are beyond happy and grateful that we were able to share our wedding day with the Fogo de Chão team. They made our wedding reception an event we will proudly look back on and cherish forever. A very heartfelt thank you to the Fogo de Chão team for this special time!”Vanessa H., 3 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/fogo-de-chao-san-jose-ca)

![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We recently celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary at Shubham Halls, and we couldn’t have asked for a better venue! From start to finish, the entire experience was seamless and truly exceptional. A huge shoutout to Manoj, who coordinated everything to absolute perfection! From the drinks menu to the décor, food, and every tiny detail, he ensured that everything was executed flawlessly. His professionalism, attentiveness, and dedication made all the difference, allowing us to simply enjoy our special day without a single worry. The venue itself is stunning, with elegant décor, ample space, and a warm ambiance that set the perfect tone for our celebration. The catering was phenomenal, with a delicious spread that our guests couldn’t stop raving about. The food was fresh, well-presented, and customized to our preferences, making the dining experience truly delightful. A special mention to DJ Ellis, who absolutely rocked the night! His energy, music selection, and ability to keep the dance floor alive made the party an absolute blast. The dance floor was electric, and our guests had the time of their lives dancing the night away! A big thank you to Hugo for crafting amazing drinks that kept the spirits high throughout the night! His skill and creativity behind the bar made the experience even more special for our guests. A huge thank you to Arunji, Sunilji, and the entire team at Shubham Halls for making our silver jubilee celebration a grand and unforgettable affair! We highly recommend this venue for any special occasion—it’s simply the best!”Vikas M., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/b5405421-c5ef-4d67-85fd-c7a04d44b9a0?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/shubham-banquet-hall)

“We hosted our October 2023 Wedding Reception at The Tech Interactive and I highly recommend it to anybody who is looking for a unique (and literally interactive) venue. It was so much fun and our guests had a great time! We rented the entire lower level and they kept the galleries and exhibits open so our guests could play with them throughout the night! They were a hit during cocktail hour as well as for taking breaks from the dance floor (although we still always had plenty of people on the dance floor!) Our event was mostly adults with a handful of younger relatives, and everyone had a great time. The exhibits at The Tech Interactive are perfect for quick and fun interactions no matter how interested (or not interested) any individual guest was in science/technology. Our engineer friends had a great time with the Cyber Detectives activities, while even our least technically-inclined guests enjoyed playing around with things like the Jet Pack Chair and Solve For Earth. This was truly best of both worlds, as we didn't have to give up any of the "traditional" wedding elements to make room for the fun of the exhibits - our tables and decorations were set up beautifully, we still had appetizers and an open bar, and like I mentioned above, there were still always plenty of people on the dance floor! We actually didn't even need to decorate as much as we might have with a more "traditional" venue either, as the existing colors, lighting, and layout of The Tech make for a strong baseline to build from. Our primary contact was Lolita and she was extremely helpful and pleasant to work with. She was there with us every step of the way, from our initial tour to our reception itself. She made sure to consider exactly what we were looking for to make our wedding special and was extremely organized and great and communicating with us as well as our other vendors. She created a great layout based on our table count, dance floor size, and the space the caterer needed, and she and her team went above and beyond and worked with our caterer and coordinator to help set everything up between the public close time and the start of our event so that everything was perfect when our guests got there. They even let us customize the exterior lighting color of the building during our event. The physical location of The Tech Interactive is fantastic as well - right in downtown San Jose within walking distance of tons of hotels and two parking garages where The Tech validates. The city closed off Market Street right in front of The Tech relatively last minute for a public city event, but Lolita was on top of it and worked with us and our shuttle company to arrange for pickup and a smooth experience for our guests. In summary: If you're looking to do something unique with your wedding or event, I can't recommend The Tech Interactive enough. Lolita was fantastic to work with and our guests couldn't stop saying how it was one of the most fun weddings they had ever been to.”Steve W., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-tech-interactive)

## About wedding venues in Santa Clara, CA

### 

California offers an incredible 840 miles of coastline, 3,000+ wineries and ancient redwoods for your wedding day. When you choose the Golden State, you're getting exceptional natural lighting for your ceremony across diverse settings from Mediterranean coastal zones to alpine mountain backdrops. Each region has its own distinctive character that can perfectly match your vision.

### What Makes California Wedding Venues So Special?

Northern California's Napa Valley welcomes you with rolling vineyards and Spanish colonial architecture where intimate wine cave ceremonies create unforgettable moments. Head to Southern California and you'll find oceanfront venues like Duke's Malibu where you can exchange vows with the Pacific stretching out behind you while enjoying fresh coastal-inspired cuisine. Palm Springs offers dramatic desert venues with mountain backdrops and striking midcentury modern architecture that photographs beautifully.

### How Much Do Wedding Venues in California Cost?

Wedding venues in California typically run between $9,600 and $11,700 which aligns nicely with the national range of $6,500-$12,000. This represents about 18% of your total wedding budget. Your overall costs will vary based on guest count:

  * 50 guests: $26,190
  * 100 guests: $43,692
  * 150 guests: $60,141
  * 200 guests: $74,836
  * 250 guests: $89,530

### Which California Venues Are Fully Accessible?

The Griffith House features wheelchair-accessible pathways throughout its Spanish-style grounds including the private ceremony lawn and separate preparation spaces for couples.

Accessibility options have improved greatly across California venues in recent years.

### When Should You Book Your California Wedding Venue?

October leads venue inquiries in California with couples typically booking venues about 13 months (400 days) before their wedding date. If you're dreaming of a Northern California wine country wedding during peak season you'll want to book up to 18 months in advance. Southern California venues offer more flexibility especially during winter months when you can still enjoy beautiful weather while potentially securing better rates.
