Hi, I’m Maddie! I’m a wedding photographer based in West Virginia! I find happiness in my family, my church, warm summer light, capturing moments on film, sunrises and sunsets, and reminiscing on nostalgic moments. I have a passion for travel and am always happy to go somewhere new! I picked up my first camera in middle school (thanks, Grandpa) and never looked back. I began documenting my own life, as well as special moments for my friends & family, and I quickly fell in love with the gift of memories that photography provides.

My goal during our time together is to create intentional photographs that are nostalgic and carry the weight of the emotions you felt on your big day. From the candids while you get ready to marry the love of your life, to the intimate details and raw personal moments in between the big events, to the party surrounded by your closest friends and family. Every aspect of your day should be documented in a way that is true to who you are as a pair. Because of this, I combine editorial inspired, posed photos alongside documentary style photos to curate intentional, storytelling wedding galleries for my couples.

  * ### Look no further!!! Maddie is the BEST!

•Verified review

•Cierra D.•Jan 11, 2025

I cannot recommend Maddie highly enough! From the first moments of our special day, her warm and calming presence immediately put us at ease. She was so kind and professional throughout the entire process, making what could have been a stressful portion of the day feel effortless and joyful. Her attention to detail and ability to capture genuine, heartfelt moments are truly unmatched. Every time I look back at my wedding photos, I’m transported to that magical day all over again. These photos are treasures I’ll cherish forever, and I’m so grateful to Maddie for preserving these memories so beautifully. If you’re looking for a photographer who is both talented and an absolute delight to work with, look no further! Congrats on your big day! I know Maddie will capture all the magic... you just go get married! ;)

  * ### THE BEST photographer E V E R!! 

•Verified review

•Vanessa C.•Dec 4, 2024

Maddie took the most beautiful pictures of my family while I was in the hospital after having my second child. She came in the room and snapped amazing pictures of my son meeting his baby sister for the first time. I will cherish these pictures forever, and I’m so grateful that she was willing to take the time to capture this memory for us 3

## Frequently asked questions

5 Answers

Ask them a question

### How many pictures will we get?

I never limit the amount of photos I provide! If they’re good, they’re delivered! I guarantee a minimum of 250 images for 8 hours of coverage, but most couples actually receive somewhere in the 600-1,100 range how the day plays out!

### Are you licensed and insured?

Sure am! Protects me and you!

### How long does it take to receive our galleries?

I guarantee delivery of your full gallery within 8-12 weeks of your wedding day! My goal is always to get it out sooner, but I do hand-edit each image to ensure the best possible final product every time. Plus, you’ll get sneak peaks within 72 hours following your wedding day to hold you over until the full gallery comes in!!

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

The earlier the better! Typically my couples book between 6-12 months before their wedding date, but some book 1.5-2 years ahead of time! Always reach out as soon as you can if you’re considering booking!

### What kind of training do you have?

I’ve been taking photos for as long as I remember, and I actually started by teaching myself in middle school! Form there, my passion actually led me to obtain my Bachelor of Fine Arts in Photography and Intermedia! Being classically trained in fine art photography has given me such a unique perspective and approach to shooting weddings! I’ve also taken a myriad of educational courses and workshops all over the U.S. and even in Europe from some of the top photographers and wedding industry educators in the world and continue to further my education to serve my clients in these ever-evolving industry!
