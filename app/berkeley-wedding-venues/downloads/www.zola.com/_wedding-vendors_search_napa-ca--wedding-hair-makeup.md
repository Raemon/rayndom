I have proudly served a countless number of weddings in Cabo San Lucas, the Temecula Valley, San Diego, the San Fransisco Bay Area and currently in the Napa and Sonoma Valleys. As a bridal makeup artist, I am devoted to helping brides radiate from the inside out. Using the power of makeup, I strive to capture your natural beauty while highlighting your best features.

I’m a natural type girl, I don’t wear much makeup at all. I did a preview for my bachelorette celebration of airbrush and wow it was amazing it lasted all night. My makeup day of the wedding again was beautiful nailed the natural look I was looking for again it lasted from 7am to midnight I was shocked and very pleased. Brittany went the extra mile on my wedding day, I had forgotten a few things and she happily brought them to me at our picture site was so great full for that. I strongly recommend booking with her she is extremely professional, prompt and such a sweet wonderful person as well!!!

Prior to booking she was responsive and had reasonable pricing, and when it came to the day off she arrived right on time. I had sent her a few inspiration pictures of how I wanted my hair and makeup and she completely nailed it! I absolutely loved my look and felt so beautiful and confident. I'm also really impressed at how long lasting the hair and makeup was, as we did a photoshoot in foggy conditions and then a whole evening of events, with no need for any touch up. Highly recommend!”Meg G., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/c7d70936-4621-4962-9f47-dae40c34e21f?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/nataly-lopez-artistry)

Look no further! Celeste is absolutely amazing. I was stuck in fonding someone that could really bring my vision to life for my day. I wanted to have soft glam waves and not look like my hear was immovable and break off ( could be trauma from all my years of scribing my hair). From the moment we connected - thanks to my wedding day coordinator’s help- she was friendly, calm, answered ALL my questions, and truly made me feel at ease. She was communicative, and very well organized- I was indecisive over my style and unfortunately, in a bind with scheduling a trial. She was flexible in her hair trial option, but my life was just chaos and I wasn’t able to go for a trial- even still. I was absolutely amazed with my hair! She provided hair prep details the day prior, to make sure my hair was in great condition for the mornring of. On the day of, she arrived with all her cargo in tow and set up to put her magic to work/ I felt like a celebrity- truly. She made me a bridal gift bag, which was a super sweet and unexpected gift of some day of necessities complete with eye masks. She managed doing hair for me and my bridal party and made my mom feel very comfortable and at esse as she has NEVER had her hair done before. My hair looked just as I had imagined & Celestes attention to details, consideration for my needs, and management of time was absolutely PHENOMENAL- I don’t know how she does it! My hair held up- despite all the wind and even at the end of the night, while a bit chaotic - it was a true testament that this bride had a BLAST at her wedding! I am incredibly grateful my coordinator found Celeste & I have followed closely along at all her work since my day because the post wedding blues are DEFINITELY hitting! Thank you Celeste for making me feel so incredibly beautiful!

LOVE + WOLVES CO BEAUTY 5.0

Beauty stems from the inside and that’s where we start with our babes. We want our couples to feel like an elevated version of themselves. We are all about complimenting the mood and aesthetic of your wedding weekend while coming up with a custom look that brings it all together. With the mama wolf, Ash having over a decade of editorial and fashion experience, our work is more fashion-forward than “bridal”. Highlighting natural beauty above all. Because we work so closely with our photographers, we know how to help you feel photo ready while still feeling “approachable”. We are stoked to be considered for your beauty needs!“I hired Love Wolves Co for my hair and make up and had the best experience with them! Karen was my stylist and she did such an amazing job both for my engagement shoot and wedding day! As someone who never wears more than some mascara, she really allowed me to still feel natural and like myself while highlighting my features and ensuring my make up would photograph well. In fact, she did such a great job with make up for me and my bridesmaids that my step-mom (who typically hates getting her make up done) added that service day of! Knowing that my fine hair doesn’t hold well, I had Karen stay for a touch up right before my ceremony and couldn’t recommend that enough! Everyone loved working with her!”Anais P., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/love-wolves-co-beauty)

It was a very hot day of 100 degrees, but my makeup lasted all night with no smudges, running, or creasing! I chose the option to do a bridal trial beforehand, which I highly recommend. I was able to see what I liked and what I didn't like so there were no surprises on the big day. I also chose the option to get a full-size lip gloss and powder to reapply when I needed it. Jasmine is also one of the sweetest people I have ever met, so it was so fun to work with her. Kate did my hair on my wedding day and it looked amazing! She used products that helped my hair hold a curl and keep all the flyaway hairs controlled. I also used clip in extensions, and she did a great job putting them in because I felt no tugging or pulling at all. Both Kate and Jasmine got my bridal party ready, and we all felt so beautiful.

I specialize in natural, timeless, and elevated makeup that enhances your features without feeling heavy or overdone. As an on-location artist, I travel to you and bring everything needed to create a calm, seamless getting-ready experience. I work with clients of all ages, skin types, and comfort levels with makeup, using high-quality, professional products that photograph beautifully and wear comfortably throughout the day.

She was so easy-going, kind, and easy to communicate with, and she listened to all my questions and concerns about makeup. I usually wear little to no makeup, which left me at ease and looking my best on my big day! She was able to give me a very natural but beautiful look, which was exactly what I wanted! She came over for a makeup trial and really solidified my look for the wedding. We were able to figure out where I would need more moisturizer and coverage for my drier spots, which really helped for the day. My makeup also lasted all day, even with dancing well into the night. I would 100% recommend her services to anyone and will keep her in mind for any future makeup services I may need :)”Stephanie R., 4 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/956fe8ae-fb0c-43b9-8a83-4d94075810f8?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/adrianne-artistry)

I have always been passionate about beauty! When clients ask me how long I have been doing this, my answer is: "I have about 14 years of experience doing makeup but 8 years doing makeup professionally". I started off initially doing makeup for friends and family, then family friends + friends of friends. I then got a job working at Sephora where I learned a lot about products and working w/ different skin types/tones, ages and styles of makeup etc for 7 years. In 2018 I decided to assist another bridal MUA and that is where I was introduced to the bridal/wedding world & I have loved it since!

I couldn’t have asked for a better makeup artist on my wedding day!”Jacqueline C., 4 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/e7207ef7-83da-45dc-b8dd-188a53582c8c?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/makeup-by-danica-roe)

Kim Baker Beauty is all about helping people feel like their best self, inside and out. This is so much more than makeup. We don't take it lightly that we are the first people you are with on your wedding day. How we make you feel is our top priority.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“If I could give Kim Baker Beauty more than 5 stars, I would!! My wife and I got married in Saratoga, California a couple of weeks ago and we couldn't have been more thrilled with Kim, Lupe, and Steven. We got hair and makeup for ourselves and our bridesmaids, junior bridesmaids, and even a little kid makeup for our flower girls. Our priorities were to feel present on our wedding day and to feel like ourselves, just a little more polished. We don't wear makeup on a day to day basis, and so we didn't want fake lashes or extensions. Kim worked with us to help us achieve our vision for our hair and makeup and encouraged us to give her extensive notes about what we didn't like at our preview (SO hard to do as a people pleaser, but Kim created a safe space where we were able to do so). My wife Ali thought she wanted a glowy look, but ended up going completely non-glowy on wedding day and LOVED it. She struggles to have her hair hold a curl for more than an hour, and Kim did such a good job her hair was still wavy the morning after the wedding after sleeping on it all night! I found out at our preview how particular I am about having my makeup done, and Kim let me do my eyeliner and eyebrows myself on our wedding day. It was the perfect balance of feeling pampered by Kim but still feeling in control of the things I am very picky about! Both of us have very sensitive scalps, and Kim made sure each and every pin felt comfortable and wasn't pinching. It made a HUGE difference in our stamina throughout our long crazy wedding to not have the added sensory nightmare of pins buried in our heads. Full disclosure, Kim is a dear friend of mine. But she and her team also hit it off with the rest of our bridal party! They're in selfies taken while getting ready, and they even got our shy junior bridesmaids chatting and laughing. We are so grateful for how they made our wedding morning feel organized, calm, and fun! If you're not sure whether to book Kim Baker Beauty, take it from me - there's none better.”Jenni C., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/kim-baker-beauty)

April May Hair - Bridal Hairstyling Specialist 5.0

  * Starts at $500 
  * Serves Napa, CA

I'm new to Zola, but not to Bridal Hair! With 17 years dedicated to crafting beautiful hair, and 8 of those in Bridal styling. My experience aids to specializing in varying styles - from vintage, to boho, to a modern esthetic. Recently, my partner and I made the exciting move to Portland from San Francisco. I can’t wait to discover all the stunning wedding venues the PNW has to offer! When I'm not doing hair, you can find me trying a new coffee shop, making kombucha, or hiking with my husband and our dog, Livia. I look forward to the opportunity to work with you!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“April did my hair for my wedding in June, 2022. I left my trial feeling even more excited about my wedding because she was amazing at helping me figure out the right style for me - to feel like myself, but a little fancier. I loved the style she created. On my wedding day, April brought such a calm presence to the room. Everyone in my wedding party was thrilled with their hair styles and enjoyed getting the chance to sit in her chair. I absolutely loved my wedding day hair - it was exactly as we'd planned, lasted all night (through some serious dancing) and was comfortable the entire event. April is an absolute expert and I'd trust her completely with my hair for any occasion!”Kari, a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/4a5e4027-eb26-449a-859c-cde80b0e0277?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/april-may-hair)

When it came time for my wedding, I immediately thought of her, as I had seen firsthand how beautifully she had done our friend's hair. I had given her an inspirational picture of my hair, and she did miracles with the volume and length. ' Til this day, I think, I looked the most beautiful I ever have. And considering my husband and I continue to be happily married, some credit must go to Analissa. I'm so glad she could join us in this celebration as well. She is as sweet as can be, listens to what you have in mind, and gives suggestions for improvement. I 100% trust her with my hair and makeup. Don't hesitate; she will become your right-hand girl on all your special occasions.
