Dejane Jane De Art 5.0

  * Gifts and favors
  * Live painters & artists
  * Starts at $2,000 
  * Serves San Ramon, CA

Hi, I'm Jane from DejaneJanedeArt, a watercolor artist based in NY and Bay Area Northern California, but available for destination weddings internationally. Want to give a wedding gift that’s as unique and personal as the couple’s love story? Live wedding painting is an interactive and memorable experience. This allows your guests to watch as I create a beautiful artwork in real-time, capturing the magic of your celebration right before their eyes. As a result, the couple will receive a fully framed, ready-to-hang original artwork that will transport them back to this special day whenever they look at it.“Jane was an absolute pleasure to work with from start to finish! Not only was she incredibly sweet-- she kept in close touch throughout the process and answered any questions we had. Her professionalism, dedication to her craft, and pure talent are all top-notch. Jane traveled to south Florida and painted live at our wedding. She arrived early to start on the background of the painting and later took a photo of us after our ceremony to place us in the foreground. We were simply blown away at the side-by-side comparison of the painting vs the photo and how beautifully she crafted the composition. The piece we received is one we'll always cherish to commemorate our special day. Our guests were floored by the final product and so were we! Jane, we cannot thank you enough for playing such a special role on our wedding day. We so appreciate your time and talent!”Olivia, 9 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/7dc1c81b-40d0-450a-940a-b219c7ea5ec8?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-extras/dejane-jane-de-art)

Ellestrations 5.0

  * Calligrapher
  * Custom signs
  * Starts at $100 
  * Serves San Ramon, CA

Hi! I’m Riz, the calligrapher and artist behind Ellestrations, a Filipina-owned creative studio based in the Bay Area. My love for typography began in grade school, and over the years, that early fascination has evolved into a passion for handlettering and a commitment to the art of calligraphy. ​ At Ellestrations, I specialize in creating custom handlettered signage for life’s most meaningful moments—everything from welcome signs and seating charts to escort cards and station signs. Whether you're planning a wedding, a special event, or simply want to elevate your space with a personal touch, I’m here to help bring your vision to life.“I was lucky enough to work with Ellestrations for my wedding. I was doing most things myself and she wanted to help bring my vision of my seating chart to life and with little direction she created a beautiful masterpiece that was more than I could have asked for. Many of my guests were very impressed especially because she did it all by hand. Hire her! Her work is amazing and she’s amazing to work with. Don’t sleep on her or you’ll miss out.”Sarai, 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/d1f12888-7129-484f-97fb-e607c18910e5?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-extras/ellestrations)

From the beginning all the way to the day after, Fachón was an amazing vendor to work with. She made sure to ask questions that never even considered and with very little guidance, she captured the vibe we wanted for day. She was even able to secure toasting champagne a few days prior to the wedding as I had forgot we needed it lol All of my guests loved their drinks and left feeling amazing.

  * Starts at $399 
  * Serves San Ramon, CA

Hi, I’m Kayla, proud mom of 3 beautiful girls and the owner of a Bay Area-based Photo Booth business, established in September 2024. My love for photos and capturing life’s most meaningful moments inspired me to create a service that helps others do the same. We proudly serve all of the Bay Area, with our home base in Martinez, CA. Every event we do is handled with care, attention to detail, and a genuine passion for making your day unforgettable.“I hired Kayla for a surprise birthday party for my boyfriend. It was an intimate kind of party. I spoke with everyone and they all really loved it. It was super easy to get our videos afterward. On a sad note, a couple days after the event one of our dear friends at the party passed and this was the last time they were photographed/video recorded. I know everyone in our group has been replaying the videos, holding on to those last memories and seeing him smiling and happy. It was more than just a 360 video but a time capsule for all of us. Kayla was super easy to work with and kind and on time. The contract process was extremely easy and straight forward. If you’re looking to make your event memorable… DO IT! You absolutely won’t regret it.

I contacted Ms. Gelli and she was very compassionate and very understanding of how I am feeling that she invited me to see their facility, and after knowing her, I know my daughter will be in great hands. Arbitots is a safe environment and I am very grateful that I have known them. I am pleased to say that my girl is always happy every time I pick her up, she showed me how she can make a sandwich by herself and I was very impressed and amazed at the same time!”Angel, 7 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-extras/arbitots-pop-up-childcare)

I love that it is a small business and that it’s run by women! The ladies at JMG communicate efficiently and respond quickly and they were willing to work with me on my ideas. We worked together to find something that would fit the budget I had in mind, as well! They had such great ideas and everyone loved the onsite engraving! It was such a nice personal touch to be able to add everyones names to their cups for them to take home and it also made the entire event much less wasteful when it came to leftover drinks and throw away plastics.

Dearest - QR Codes that capture photos, videos & guest sentiments. Photo Guest Books & Slide Shows! 5.0

  * Guest book alternatives

  * Starts at $50 
  * Serves San Ramon, CA

*Dearest is not a photo booth. Dearest is a beautifully simple way to gather and preserve memories from weddings, showers, birthdays, retirements, and more. Guests share photos, videos, and heartfelt messages via a personalized QR code—after the event, so they can be fully present. Every package includes a private gallery to view, download, print, or turn into a curated photobook. We also offer printable QR code templates, signage, and display cards on Etsy, with 100% of profits benefiting Vow for Girls, a global movement to end child marriage. More than a guest book, Dearest keeps the joy, love, and laughter alive long after the celebration.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Me and my besties had a girls trip and we took SO MANY memorable photos. Instead of sending, sharing, remembering, etc., it was so easy for each of us to just post the photos to Dearest. Voila! Everything is compiled, organized and shared. We are all so happy to have this keepsake to remember such a fun trip/event. I recommend Dearest for anyone looking to gather photos/videos from multiple sources and to organize them. Hope to get the optional printed album next!”stacey k., 2 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/26f7ad09-5c2a-4ea4-ba89-ec88e1b68a0a?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-extras/dearest--2)

BNG Worldwide Chauffeur Services is a premier transportation company based in San Jose, CA, proudly serving the San Francisco Bay Area since 2014. Specializing in weddings and special events, BNG offers a luxury fleet of SUVs, sedans, and 27–56 passenger buses to suit every celebration. Whether it’s a one-way transfer or a full-day itinerary, BNG ensures every ride is on time, seamless, and elegant — delivering a VIP experience for you and your guests.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We booked BNG Worldwide Chauffeur Services for our wedding in San Jose, and they truly exceeded our expectations. From the first inquiry to the final drop-off, their communication was clear, professional, and responsive. We had an Executive Sprinter Van for the bridal party and a black SUV for family members. Both vehicles arrived early, spotless inside and out, and the chauffeurs were dressed professionally and extremely courteous. Our driver for the Sprinter (I believe his name was Sam) was especially great—he helped the bridal party in and out, managed time perfectly, and even had water bottles ready in the van. What stood out most was how stress-free they made the whole experience. They coordinated directly with our wedding planner for timing and route changes, which took a huge load off our shoulders. If you’re planning a wedding in the Bay Area—especially around San Jose, San Francisco, or Oakland—I’d strongly recommend BNG. They know how to handle weddings and treat everyone like a VIP.”Scarlet W., 6 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-extras/bng-worldwide-chauffeur-services)
