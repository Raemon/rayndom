Born and raised in Concord, CA, I’ve spent most of my life in the East Bay. I’ve been married 14 years and am a proud girl-dad to an 11-year-old who shares my love for baseball and the SF Giants. Photography is my lifelong passion. I’m fun, laid back, and highly responsive. From our first chat to your final gallery, I’m there every step. On your wedding day, I bring a calm presence, guide the flow, and help you feel at ease. The result? Relaxed, joyful images that reflect the real you. Captured with care, creativity, and intention.

With over a decade of experience, my goal is to use my cinematic approach and creative lighting skills to set a unique and special mood, show off my clients’ personalities and reflect true experiences and emotions. This is what sets my work apart. From how you met and what your relationship looks like to what you envision for your wedding, I love getting to know the people I photograph well beforehand so by the time your day arrives, you’ll see me as both your photographer and a trusted friend. I strive to create an experience that is creative, comfortable and most of all – fun.

  * ### Best photographer I’ve ever worked with!

•Verified review

•Kylie K.•Jan 21, 2025

Jeff Roush Photography was an absolute pleasure to work with for our wedding. From the beginning, Jeff's communication style was articulate, professional, inclusive, responsive, and clear, putting us at ease throughout the entire process. The quality of his work was captivating, polished, clear/crisp, balanced, and vibrant - the photos truly captured the entire story of our special day in stunning detail. Jeff was with us from start to finish, making our wedding day much more enjoyable with his optimistic and welcoming presence, even during some stressful moments beyond his control. We received so many compliments on the photos, and Jeff delivered them to us much faster than expected. We consider Jeff a friend after that day and can't wait to work with him again in the future. We highly recommend Jeff Roush Photography to any couple looking for an incredible wedding photographer!

Jeff Roush Photography was an absolute pleasure to work with on our wedding day. From our very first interaction, he was informative, prompt, and clear in his communication, putting us at ease throughout the entire process. The quality of his work was simply stunning - the photos he captured were detailed, beautiful, and exquisite. Jeff arrived super early on the day of our wedding and even stayed later than contracted to ensure he got the perfect shots. We were thrilled with the results and will definitely be booking him for any future events. We couldn't recommend Jeff Roush Photography more highly!
