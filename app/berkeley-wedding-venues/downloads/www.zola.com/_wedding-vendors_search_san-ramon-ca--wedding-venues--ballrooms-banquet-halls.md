![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“San Ramon Waters By Wedgewood Weddings was a stunning venue for our wedding, but we did experience some minor communication issues that caused a bit of stress at the start of the day. The space itself was truly breathtaking, with its amazing new upgrades and beautiful views. However, there were a few details that weren't properly communicated to us, which led to a bit of a rocky start. Although my bridal party and I had lots to deal with prior to ceremony start, these issues were not something our guests would have seen/noticed. To their credit, the Wedgewood team acknowledged their mistakes and upgraded our bar package to make up for it. Overall, the venue was beautiful and the staff did their best to ensure our day went smoothly, despite the initial hiccups. We would recommend San Ramon Waters to other couples looking for a gorgeous wedding location.”Gabriella G., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/09e08c08-a991-4f46-8f27-5f0c08b2944c?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/san-ramon-by-wedgewood-weddings)

![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“One word: Perfect. As someone who suffers from severe anxiety, I can honestly say I have never felt more at-ease and confident than while working with the Wedgewood Weddings Redwood Canyon team -- they always had our backs, kept us on track, and made us feel taken care of. From the first venue visit, during the planning meetings, all the way until the rehearsal and wedding day, the professionalism, clear communication, planning resources, and organized approach made for a seamless experience. We worked with Allison as our Wedding Planner and Coordinator and I firmly believe that she is one of the main reasons our wedding went as incredibly as it did. Redwood Canyon, provides a planning binder as soon as you sign that includes monthly checklists ahead of the wedding to help keep you organized in between planning meetings. It is also filled with valuable information about the wedding planning process, examples, vendor questions, and general guidelines. It helped us structure the planning process without losing the ability to truly personalize our event. Every meeting we had with the planning team was concise, direct, and organized -- it helped us stay on track throughout the process and gave us the opportunity to discuss ideas and ask for advice (which they are also more than happy to give via email). Super responsive and accommodating -- we were so impressed with how easy the process was. We also partnered with their recommended Bakery, DJ, and Florist as part of our vendor team, and the coordination between venue and vendors was absolutely seamless...by the time the week of the wedding rolled around all the main aspects were locked in and we knew the event was in good hands. The wedding day itself was perfect. Allison served as our Day-Of-Coordinator, and together with Jacoby (co-coordinator), Liv (banquet captain), Liz (banquet captain), and rest of the team (cooks, servers, bartenders) we had the most incredible wedding. We arrived at the agreed-upon time on the day of the wedding, and from that moment onwards, the Redwood Canyon team took over to deliver the best experience. They were organized, calm, kept us well hydrated and fed, and kept everything on track for us all night. We were able to confidently hand off the reins -- we didn't have to think of anything all day other than having a good time and enjoying our day as much as possible, trusting that all the logistics were in good hands. Overall, the venue itself was gorgeous. We had our ceremony in the Arbor Lawn, our Reception in the Grand Ballroom (we initially chose the venue primarily because of the dance floor), and rented out the Rose Room for the Cocktail Hour. Everything was included and beautifully decorated with all our desired personal touches, the food and drinks were delicious, and the planning and coordination services must be some of the best in the business. I can't imagine a more incredible experience than what we had and am so thankful for the Redwood Canyon team's care and professionalism -- especially Allison, who we were fortunate enough to work with from first meeting through the day-of. The wedding day went off without a hitch and I couldn't recommend the Redwood Canyon team more 3”Marina F., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/d5dda06b-10b8-4021-a2a3-f9a3854be326?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/redwood-canyon-by-wedgewood-weddings)

“We had our wedding at Boundary Oak in May 2024, and I can’t say enough great things about our experience—especially working with Angelique. From our very first tour her professionalism, warmth, and attention to detail were top tier. We toured seven venues before choosing Boundary Oak, and it was the combination of stunning grounds and exceptional customer service that sealed the deal for us. Our initial food tasting was decent—typical wedding food—but a new head chef joined about six months before our wedding. The improvement was noticeable and really elevated our reception meal. Our guests raved about the food! If I had to give any constructive feedback, it would be regarding the bridal suite. While functional, it could definitely benefit from an upgrade. Adding a private bathroom and a lock on the door would make a huge difference in comfort and privacy for the bride on such an important day. Overall, we had a fantastic experience at Boundary Oak and are so grateful to Angelique and the entire team for helping make our day so special!”Kamika W., 8 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/526916a5-33b6-4a5d-b664-51c4f00afa12?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-clubhouse-at-boundary-oak)

## About wedding venues in San Ramon, CA

### 

California offers an incredible 840 miles of coastline, 3,000+ wineries and ancient redwoods for your wedding day. When you choose the Golden State, you're getting exceptional natural lighting for your ceremony across diverse settings from Mediterranean coastal zones to alpine mountain backdrops. Each region has its own distinctive character that can perfectly match your vision.

### What Makes California Wedding Venues So Special?

Northern California's Napa Valley welcomes you with rolling vineyards and Spanish colonial architecture where intimate wine cave ceremonies create unforgettable moments. Head to Southern California and you'll find oceanfront venues like Duke's Malibu where you can exchange vows with the Pacific stretching out behind you while enjoying fresh coastal-inspired cuisine. Palm Springs offers dramatic desert venues with mountain backdrops and striking midcentury modern architecture that photographs beautifully.

### How Much Do Wedding Venues in California Cost?

Wedding venues in California typically run between $9,600 and $11,700 which aligns nicely with the national range of $6,500-$12,000. This represents about 18% of your total wedding budget. Your overall costs will vary based on guest count:

  * 50 guests: $26,190
  * 100 guests: $43,692
  * 150 guests: $60,141
  * 200 guests: $74,836
  * 250 guests: $89,530
  * 300 guests: $104,224



### Which California Venues Are Fully Accessible?

The Griffith House features wheelchair-accessible pathways throughout its Spanish-style grounds including the private ceremony lawn and separate preparation spaces for couples. You might also consider Holman Ranch Sunstone Winery and Villa del Sol d'Oro though you'll want to directly confirm their specific accessibility features when you visit. Accessibility options have improved greatly across California venues in recent years.

### When Should You Book Your California Wedding Venue?

October leads venue inquiries in California with couples typically booking venues about 13 months (400 days) before their wedding date. If you're dreaming of a Northern California wine country wedding during peak season you'll want to book up to 18 months in advance. Southern California venues offer more flexibility especially during winter months when you can still enjoy beautiful weather while potentially securing better rates.

### Where Can You Find Exceptional Culinary Experiences in California?

La Valencia Hotel in La Jolla delivers impeccable service with menu options from lobster bisque to perfectly prepared steak. You'll love Vibiana in Los Angeles with its chef-driven menus served in a stunning restored cathedral setting.
