  * ### Beautiful & Easy!

•Verified review

•Charlene•Dec 30, 2022

Those are the two of the r elements I look for when sourcing a space to book for my events. Tarocco is such a beautiful space and the owner, Sequoia, and her team are incredibly easy to work with. From a photography and videography standpoint, the natural light is absolutely perfect. Communication prior, during and after our events were flawless and the food… I’ve had 2 events here and every time the food was both delicious to eat and look at. Parking is ample and the space is easy to find. I honestly can’t say enough about this space. The opportunities to make the interior your own is endless thanks to the minimalist decor. Tarocco is easily one of my top 5 places to book in the Bay Area and I continue to refer anyone here without hesitation.

  * ### Highly recommend

•Verified review

•Farah Trading Co•Dec 29, 2022

Working with Sequoia and her team at Tarocco was a seamless experience. I used Tarocco for two private events in which Tarocco provided the food and the wine. From booking the event, to choosing the menu, to closing up shop; Tarocco made my events super easy to pull off. Tarocco was quick to respond to my inquiry and was easily available for questions etc. prior to the event. The event space is beautiful and worked well for each unique event; one was seated and one was a more casual cocktail type event. Overall, 5 stars!
