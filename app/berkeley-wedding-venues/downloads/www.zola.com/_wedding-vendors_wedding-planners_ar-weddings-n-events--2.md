  * ### Dream Wedding Team 

•Verified review

•Margaux•Sep 11, 2025

From the moment we first met with AnnaMarie and the team at AR Weddings N Events, we knew we were in good hands. Their communication style was attentive, positive, and enthusiastic throughout the entire planning process. The attention-to-detail, big picture perspective, and warm approach they brought to executing our vision was truly impressive. AnnaMarie executed our vision for the table settings and flowers perfectly while I was away getting ready, and they were around monitoring the entire wedding to make sure it was perfect and we didn't hear of any problems. As very organized and anxious planners, we appreciated that AnnaMarie checked in with us bi-weekly to ensure everything was on track. They truly brought our dream wedding to light.

Response from vendor•Nov 21, 2025

Margaux & Griffin Thank you so much for sharing this incredibly thoughtful review—your words truly mean the world to me. From our very first meeting, I knew working with you would be something special. Your passion, organization, and attention to detail made the planning process such a joy, and seeing your dream come to life was an unforgettable experience. It warms my heart to know you felt supported and assured every step of the way. Knowing you could relax and be present while we brought your vision to life—especially during those final moments getting ready—was exactly what I hoped to give you. I genuinely miss working with you both. Our planning calls and bi-weekly check-ins were something I always looked forward to. Thank you for trusting me and the AR Weddings N Events team with such an important chapter of your lives. Being part of your wedding journey was an honor and a privilege. Wishing you endless love, laughter, and beautiful new memories ahead. And please know—you’ll always have a special place in my heart (and in the AR Weddings N Events family). 💛 AnnaMarie Rubio
