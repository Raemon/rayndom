  * ### You won’t regret 

•Verified review

•Keily R.•5:20 am

We are 100% sure you are going to enjoy and never forget the experience. Paola is amazing you can truly see the reflection of her work in the photos. She is incredibly patient and kind, and her communication was excellent at every moment. She answered all our questions and made us feel comfortable throughout the shoot. It was worth every penny.

  * ### Don’t hesitate to book with Paola!

•Verified review

•Cassidy D.•Nov 6, 2025

Paola was absolutely amazing to work with! She stayed in touch with scheduled follow-ups leading up to the wedding, which made us feel so confident that every important moment would be captured. On the day itself, she was so pleasant, kind, and easygoing — she truly helped us feel comfortable in front of the camera. Posing can sometimes feel awkward, but she brought out such genuine smiles and made the whole experience feel natural and fun. When we received our photos (after just a few short weeks!), we were absolutely stunned by the quality and emotion in every shot. Each image feels like a favorite, and we can’t wait to look back on them for years to come. Don’t hesitate to book with her — you’ll be so glad you did!

  * ### Excellent photographer for our Wedding!!

•Verified review

•Kelsey and A.•Aug 23, 2025

Paola did an amazing job at capturing my intimate wedding! She communicated well with me and my husband leading up to the wedding. During the ceremony she worked really well to get the perfect shots of us and our guests. The photos all turned out beautifully and we got them within her stated deadline. She helped guide my husband and I into different poses during the photo session. She was very kind and patient throughout the entire process! I would definitely recommend Paola to capture any important events! I wilp definitely rehire her for any other important events in my life.

  * ### Excellent communication 

•Verified review

•Sandra & N.•Apr 27, 2024

We went over some of our ideas with Paola and she clearly understood the concept that we had in mind. This was due to us having great communication and her clearly understanding what we wanted. All the pictures and video that she took during our day were great!
