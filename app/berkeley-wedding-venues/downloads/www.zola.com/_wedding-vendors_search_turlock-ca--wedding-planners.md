Casey's Curated Events 5.0

  * Offers 7 services
  * Starts at $150 
  * Serves Turlock, CA
  * Offer

With over 10 years of experience in the event planning industry, I specialize in transforming visions into seamless, memorable experiences. As a dedicated perfectionist who thrives under pressure, my focus is always on the small details that make an event extraordinary. I began planning everything from intimate birthdays and gender reveals to elaborate engagement parties and baby showers. Since officially stepping into the wedding business in 2021, I have navigated and managed every challenge the industry presents, ensuring a stress-free process for my clients.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Casey’s Curated Events made planning our destination wedding an absolute breeze. Casey was there every step of the way with incredible energy, organization, communication and above all dedication. From the beginning, Casey took the time to truly understand my vision and explained the planning process in a clear, easy to understand way which was especially helpful while planning a destination wedding on a short five month timeline. I felt supported and informed throughout the entire process. I gave Casey full creative freedom with our invitations, and she completely delivered! Her creativity and attention to detail set the tone for our wedding from the start. She was also incredibly responsive, making herself available via email, text, and phone, and handled communication between the travel agency, resort coordinator, and vendors seamlessly. As the wedding approached and decisions felt overwhelming, Casey always reassured me and helped narrow down options, making everything feel manageable. From creating a comprehensive packing list (down to things like bobby pins!) to personally making sure we didn’t have to worry about the little details, Casey thought of everything. When we arrived at the resort, she took the time to walk the property with us — showing us the ceremony and reception spaces, photo locations, rehearsal and helping us visualize the full experience. She also joined us in meeting the on-site coordinator and ensured everyone was aligned. Her ability to advocate for us, ask the right questions, and clarify details made such a difference, especially since most communication with the resort had taken place via email. On our wedding day, Casey was truly amazing. She coordinated everything behind the scenes, kept everyone on schedule, and solved problems before we even knew they existed. Her calm presence, care, and positive energy allowed me to fully enjoy every moment of our wedding. Thank you, Casey, for going above and beyond. Having you as our wedding planner was truly a blessing.”Silvia D., a month ago![](https://images.zola.com/5b1c0fb0-aea9-426f-9a40-1bf23b278a07?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/casey-s-curated-events)

Bowen Weddings 5.0

  * Serves Turlock, CA

Hi, I’m Breahna — owner and lead coordinator at Bowen Weddings! 💕 My love for weddings began with helping friends and family bring their dream days to life, and I quickly knew it was my calling. I believe every couple deserves a wedding where they can be fully present, not stressed about timelines or vendors. Whether it’s a grand celebration or an intimate micro wedding, I’m your calm in the chaos — guiding you through details, keeping things on track, and making your vision a reality. ✨“Having Breahna as our day of wedding coordinator was truly one of the greatest gifts of our entire wedding experience. She handled our big day with a level of professionalism, grace, and attention to detail that blew us away. From the moment the day began, she was two steps ahead managing vendors, checking timelines, handling last-minute changes without breaking a sweat, and doing it all with a calm, confident presence that made everyone around her feel at ease. Her ability to quietly take charge while keeping things relaxed allowed me to be fully present and enjoy every moment without stress. What made it even more special is knowing how deeply she cared not just about the logistics, but about us. That love and dedication showed in everything she did, from fluffing my dress before I walked down the aisle to making sure the reception flowed seamlessly. Breahna, thank you for making our wedding day not only smooth and beautiful, but unforgettable. You made magic happen behind the scenes, and we are endlessly grateful. If you’re lucky enough to have Breahna coordinate your wedding know that you are in the best hands imaginable!”Melaina U., 5 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/bowen-weddings)

From the moment we started our wedding planning journey, Evelyn's kindness, guidance and unwavering support made every step a happy experience. Planning has never been my forte and I overwhelm easily when decisions need to be made, but her gentle guidance throughout the months of planning alleviated any stress I had, and her attention to detail ensured that every corner of our special day was nothing short of perfect. From coordinating vendors to orchestrating the flow of events seamlessly, they allowed us to fully enjoy ourselves in the moment without a worry in the world. Our guests were also so happy saying on multiple occasions it was the best wedding they had ever been to. One of the extra cherished highlights of our day was the ceremony where Evelyn also took the role as our officiant. Her heartfelt words and genuine warmth created an atmosphere that exceeded our wildest dreams and had everyone crying. We also had live music for ceremony and cocktail hour provided by Aspen Strings which really added that elegant touch we had always envisioned. In short, Love & Laughter Weddings not only met but surpassed every expectation we had for our wedding day.

Hi, I’m Morgan! Thank you so much for being here. I am the Owner and Lead Planner of MBK Events. Let’s get straight to it - I freaking love love and I love planning. I swear, celebrating love, planning events, and getting to meet new people is my specialty. While planning my own wedding, I realized that so many Brides are not enjoying the process - so, that's where I plan to step in! I officially launched my business in October of 2021 so I can help other brides execute, plan, style and enjoy the wedding planning process. It is the most magical time of your life so lets make sure it feels magical all the way to the big day!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Morgan was an absolutely AMAZING wedding planner. We booked her for her partial planning services and she went above and beyond our expectations. Her services were not only perfect but the vendors she recommended were also top notch -- we couldn't have found them without her. Morgan never missed a planning bullet point and ensured we were on top of everything. Overall, she was a fantastic communicator that helped pull together our vision for our perfect day. Thank you Morgan!”Michael & L., 4 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/dcc7492f-9665-410c-9606-e413a0195352?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/mbk-events)

From our initial call, I felt at ease and I could instantly tell that Ashley’s easy-going and calm demeanor would be a fit for us. She went above and beyond with our day-of coordination and was excellent at communicating with us and our vendors. She was always an email or text away when it came down to the final days before the wedding and I had a question or idea! Ashley is also very thorough and detail-oriented. She made sure we had everything covered, including a few things I hadn’t thought of myself!We were truly so happy with how our entire wedding day turned out and having someone as talented and professional as Ashley from Rose Event Co. made everything feel effortless.

We hired Dana as a day of coordinator but she is so much more than that. She went to countless vendor meeting and kept track of all of my overly detailed instructions to make sure each piece of our day (timeline, vendor contracts, etc) worked with those details. When the venue dropped the ball, others got details wrong, or vendors fell through, Dana was always a step ahead and came up with even better solutions than our original plans. Dana really knows the ins and outs of organizing a wedding, is in tune with the Columbus wedding scene, and has incredibly valuable connections. Overall we were blown away by Dana and her team’s professionalism and dedication to our wedding. Dana’s communications were always prompt, detailed, and thorough every step of the way, making the planning process a breeze. She lead our rehearsal too which is exactly what we needed. Her team also went above and beyond the day-of to ensure every aspect of our special day was executed flawlessly. We cannot recommend Dana and her team highly enough to any couple looking for a wedding planning team that will truly make their day unforgettable.

I've loved weddings since childhood, from sketching dresses in my notebooks to planning my own wedding in 2019.

Let’s create a stress-free, unforgettable day together!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Hiring Kalyna as our day-of coordinator was the best decision we made for our wedding!

They made me so happy because they were absolutely perfect, and I credit that entirely to Amanda’s dedication and collaboration with Emporio, the preferred floral vendor at Hard Rock Los Cabos. Florals were the wedding detail I cared about the most, and they also caused me the most worry. They hold such a special place in my heart because I believe they truly accentuate the beauty of a wedding. From the moment Amanda stepped in, she eased all my anxieties. She was dedicated, focused, and meticulous in her attention to detail. She was assertive in communicating my needs to the vendor, efficient in coordinating every step, proactive in addressing potential challenges, and direct in making sure my vision was honored exactly as I imagined. Her strong and trusted relationship with Emporio made all the difference. They clearly respect and value her, which ensured flawless execution and also saved me thousands of dollars. That kind of value comes from her experience, credibility, and deep commitment to her clients. Because of Amanda, my my most treasured design element was in the very best hands. If you have the opportunity to work with her, I recommend it wholeheartedly. She is worth every penny and more.”Anastasia L., 5 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/4d1f1f9a-16a4-4225-b0fc-e7b88ac1c1cf?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/amanda-antonetti-events)

Diana, the owner, is incredibly fast, effective, and reassuring in her communication style. She is detail-oriented and truly passionate about her work, which shows in the seamless execution of our wedding day. Diana took over our event planning after our original coordinator canceled just two months before the big day, and she hit the ground running to give us the peace of mind and support we needed. Diana went above and beyond, even driving all the way from Tahoe to ensure our special day was perfect. We cannot recommend Blue Sierra Events, Rentals & Photo Booth highly enough - Diana is truly your best friend on your wedding day.

It’s one thing to concept a vision in your mind or explain it to someone, but it’s another to see that vision executed beyond what you knew was possible. She totally understood the feeling and aesthetic we were going for, was organized to a T, came up with the sweetest details we never would have thought of, and was a stellar communicator. I didn’t think I’d be someone who would say this, but our wedding day was the best day of our lives, and Genevieve's art of wedding planning made it so.”Jyssica Leilani H., 2 years ago![](https://images.zola.com/efe9cd37-1bc6-4130-a566-10d5d25396f3?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/eve-events-co)
