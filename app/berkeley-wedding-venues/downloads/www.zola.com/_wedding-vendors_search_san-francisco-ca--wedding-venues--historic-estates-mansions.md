![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We recently had our wedding at Suisun Valley Inn, and overall, it was a beautiful and memorable experience. One of the biggest highlights was being able to use the venue for three full days, which gave us extra time to relax and connect with our bridal party and loved ones. That extended access truly made a difference in how special the weekend felt. However, there were a few challenges that did impact our plans. The event barn, which was a key part of our original vision, was unfortunately not finished in time for our wedding. While we understand this was out of the owner’s control, we were disappointed that we were not refunded the full 2,000 deposit, especially since the change affected nearly every aspect of our day. Additionally, when we arrived, we were surprised to find the vineyard had been plowed without any prior notice. This forced another last-minute adjustment to our setup so we wouldn’t be facing a dirt lot. It would have been really helpful to have been told about that in advance. Despite these hiccups, the venue itself has so much potential and charm, and we did have a lovely wedding. I just hope some of these experiences can help future couples plan better or spark a few improvements from the venue for the future.”Analisa R., 8 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/024bd0c3-3769-4479-be04-a31009a3418e?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/suisun-valley-inn-at-monroe-ranch)

“We loved the idea of booking a reception venue that already had an incredible staff in-house. GAMH provided us with great care and kind but honest input every step of the way. The event coordinator (the fabulous Mandy!), audio, lighting, catering, servers, bar service, coat check…..was perfection because the team is their own and prideful for the space and its legendary music history. It was special to introduce so many out-of-town guests to this beautiful classic of a venue in the heart of our city and dance the night away. We’ll never forget it and will enjoy attending shows that much more forever.”Emily R., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/great-american-music-hall)

“We hosted our wedding at the Presidio Officers' Club and had truly the most special, incredible day of our lives. It was clean, well-organized, with delicious food and friendly staff. Not to mention, the planning team at the Presidio, through Wedgewood Weddings, was truly best-in-class. Wedgewood prepared us so well, providing a planning binder and step-by-step instructions. They checked in with us multiple times, providing walk-throughs, and answering every question extremely promptly. We especially loved our planner and day-of coordinator, Christian, who went out of his way to make everything so seamless. Christian taught us how to do our ceremony, including little details such as hand placement, went out of his way to accommodate a creative painting engagement, and provided private time for us newlyweds. He was perfect! So grateful to this beautiful venue and our wonderful team. We will treasure our experience with Wedgewood forever.”Natasha H., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/4ee55ad9-e863-4cba-a1fb-b459a421b4da?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/officers-club-at-the-presidio)
