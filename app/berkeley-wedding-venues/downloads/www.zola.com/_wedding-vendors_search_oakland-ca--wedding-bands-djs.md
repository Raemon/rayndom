He worked flawlessly with me, my partner, and our wedding planner to pull off an incredibly fun reception. Richard did an initial call with my partner to discuss the general vibe we were looking for, and we knew immediately he would be a great fit for our wedding. Richard gave us a helpful questionnaire to fill out key songs and general musical interests (and do not play songs). Richard was also happy to jump on calls with us to talk through our questions and hopes for our big day. I especially appreciated that Richard was able to play some German songs for some guests who had flown in from Germany, as that got even some of our older relatives on the dance floor. People were partying all night thanks to Richard! Richard catered to our wide age range of guests, and even gave us a couple of bonus closing songs that were the perfect conclusion to the night. We could not have asked for a better DJ.”Chelsea P., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/4115ccdf-dcf7-4cb9-8ac6-65414450fe8a?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/all-ears-dj)

Golden Bell offers a unique musical blend that packs a high-energy punch! The DJ/live fusion band, or DJ/live band hybrid, is always anchored on a DJ set but supported by live musicians. With all the energy and hype of a live band and the flexibility of a DJ, you won’t have to decide between hiring a band or a DJ for your next event or wedding.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Golden Bells was PHENOMENAL! Marlon and the entire band absolutely crushed it at our wedding. Not only is every musician insanely talented, but Marlon curated the night perfectly -- easing in with oldies to get our parents and older guests moving, then seamlessly shifting into the EDM, pop, and Bay Area rap we love. It felt like the soundtrack of us, and everyone could feel that. One of the highlights of the night was when the band came onto the dance floor with drums, trumpet, guitar, and trombone -- and even let us drum in a bit. The energy was unbelievable. And Hava Nagila with a full live band? Unreal. The band/DJ fusion setup made the entire reception feel elevated, unique, and unforgettable. They're truly a one-of-one. We got so many compliments throughout the night and later about the music, the vibe, and the experience the band created. Everything ran smoothly -- from emceeing to sound to transitions -- and you can tell the quality of their equipment and professionalism is top-notch. We can't thank Marlon and the Golden Bells team enough for making our wedding feel like a celebration we'll never forget. Highly, highly recommend them!”Sam, 2 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/4e91b90b-013d-4ad8-9331-a14c876020d8?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/golden-bell-music)

I thought that a live band for our wedding would be out of our reach, but LPE was so easy to work with and what an incredible value! Our band, LPE Snapshot was incredible and our ceremony musicians were amazing too! The vocalists were high energy and kept the whole event moving. They were great Emcess and they even added some special non-traditional reception activities for us. They were super flexible and played all the songs we asked for- even some very “niche” tracks we asked for during the ceremony. So many of my guests said the band was their favorite part of the reception. I highly recommend LPE entertainment! (I am also a musician myself so I’m very picky!)”Katie, 7 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/3a5b7faf-b009-4dff-8e57-7f4369ba5d00?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/louis-pettinelli-entertainment)

The Celebration DJ 5.0 Oakland, CA

  * DJ
  * Starts at $1,400 
  * Offer

I’ve been playing weddings for over twelve years and I love my work! My services cover any or all aspects of wedding & receptions. I have found my life’s artistic calling in becoming flexible to every type of music my clients could desire. I learn to enjoy whatever my clients love and this resonance makes my job sustainable and ever-enjoyable. But, I do tend to request the ability to make choices for the dance-floor that rely on my years of dance-enhancing experience. I meet with my clients to determine what music they would love to hear and what music they do NOT want to hear.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We found Brandon through our wedding planner Christine Garrison of CMG Events. She suggested him because we were interested in having someone play acoustic guitar and singing during the wedding. After chatting with Brandon, we hired him to play the guitar for our ceremony, act as a wandering minstrel during the cocktail hour, and DJ the entire event. Our ceremony took place outdoors in an open lawn area. Brandon did a great job with setting up the sound. Everyone was able to hear both us and the officiant clearly. The acoustic rendition of Heartbeats (Jose Gonzalez) and Wildflowers (Tom Petty) he played for our processional and recessional were beautiful and really set the mood we were looking for. Brandon also did a great job DJing the event. He was able to take a small number of songs and expand the playlist to not only fit our tastes but keep the party hopping. We had expected that we would have minimal dancing and that our crowd would mostly just sit around chatting. However, Brandon was able to keep the energy up and the dance floor going throughout the night. It far exceeded our expectations and made the night really memorable. He was extremely professional throughout the planning process. We had several calls leading up to the wedding, and he made it easy to communicate what we were looking for in the event. We added songs to a few different playlists which he used as a jumping off point. He also provided suggestions for all the important moments (e.g., processionals, recessional, first dance, grand entrance). His contract and other documents were also clear and always sent promptly. On the day of Brandon arrived on time for set up and did a great job with all aspects (sound, DJing, acoustic performance, and lighting) of the event. He looked extremely professional and was communicative throughout the day, constantly checking in with the planner and us to make sure everything was going well. If he wasn’t sure about a song, he’d ask before playing it. Best of all, he was extremely reasonably priced. His assistant, Josh, was also very nice and did a great job.”Liz, 7 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/1cebf972-3bdf-4908-b3cd-3108b35f5bcb?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/the-celebration-dj)

  * DJ
  * Starts at $1,500 

NODJNOPARTY Entertainment | DJ TNT Turning Moments into Memories — One Beat at a Time With over 17 years of professional experience, DJ TNT is more than just a DJ—he’s a vibe curator, energy architect, and celebration expert. Trained by his late father, the legendary DJ TeddyB, music is in his DNA. Every beat he drops carries a legacy of passion, precision, and pure joy.“Trecee was our DJ for our outdoor wedding reception, and he was amazing! My husband and I were originally going to just play music from our phone, but I’m glad that we found and hired Trecee instead! With no coordinator and last minute changes before and on the day of our wedding, Trecee remained professional, flexible, and fun as our DJ and MC! He followed our song cue list wonderfully, and helped us remix our first dance songs just how we planned. He made announcements we had set on the schedule as well as additional ones requested. He also made funny comments, which totally added to the vibes. His music choices were just what we were looking for, and even with a request by my family to switch to slower songs, he did it seamlessly; Fun, hyped songs for the younger crowd and romantic songs for the elders. He arrived about 45 minutes before his contract hours started to set up and even gave us (bridal party) warnings and updates on getting behind or on track of schedule! (Which is very helpful as, again, we didn’t have a coordinator.) Overall, he is a great DJ & MC, and my now husband and I would highly recommend his services! I will post more pictures once available.”Midore Q., 4 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/341dab4a-cfbb-4dd1-9919-18e66626d0fc?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/nodjnoparty-entertainment)

Garuda Blue is the hip and premier jazz and party band of the San Francisco Bay Area, specializing in authentic, high-quality jazz and party music for weddings, corporate functions, events, etc. Composed of the finest young jazz musicians around, the band prides itself in delivering high-quality, sophisticated, and authentic jazz and party music for any occasion. With slick original arrangements of well-known jazz tunes, burning solos, foot-stomping party music, as well as a youthful, fun, and hip attitude, the band is sure to bring good vibes and positive energy to any event.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“I’ve been to many weddings and live music absolutely elevates the wedding compared to using a dj. But even amongst live bands, Garuda Blue is just top of the top composed of jazz musicians who all have their own flair and soul to their music. Their music is original and never the same and having them play at our wedding may have been the single best choice. From cocktail hours to dancing, the live instruments and absolutely stunning vocalist makes you really feel like you are at somewhere special. They’re also absolutely professional and kind and personable. I can’t say enough good things about them. Yes if you get a dj it’s cheaper, but you will miss out on a magical night filled with real music and what is life without real music. Don’t hesitate to think if it’s worth it or not because real great live music can transform an ordinary event to a magical one.”Sam, a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/34270853-958b-433a-9bb4-f2a200f4264e?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/garuda-blue)

Hella Fitzgerald 5.0 Oakland, CA

  * Band or Ensemble
  * Starts at $4,000 

Hella Fitzgerald is a party band collective based in Oakland, CA, that provides live music services for weddings. They specialize in vintage jazz and soul, funk, R&B, the '90s, and Top 40, offering a well-rounded, soulful experience for couples and their guests. Featuring some of the best musicians and vocalists in Northern CA, their song list includes a wide range of genres and eras, for which they have developed seamless transitions. The band offers flexibility in size and instrumentals, adapting to your specific vision and style and can provide live music for the entirety of your wedding, ensuring every moment is perfectly complimented.“Hella Fitzgerald, led by the amazing Lilan Kane, did a fabulous job at my son’s wedding. From the clear and timely communication with Lilan herself (no third party manager) over the months leading up to the big day about our budget and hopes and dreams, to the actual wedding day, it could not have been more perfect! The highlights were the epic brass band that led the 200 guests from the outdoor wedding ceremony to the reception, the mother-son dance (perhaps not the dancing skills but definitely the beautiful rendition of “What the World Needs Now (Is Love)” by Lilan and her band), and the song set with the glorious horns that kept the dance floor hopping (with everyone from the youngest guest to grandma) all night long! It went by too fast, but the memories will last forever! We could not have been more pleased! I could not recommend Hella Fitzgerald more!”Ana Y., a year ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/hella-fitzgerald)

Like… people are still talking about them months later. The dance floor was packed literally all night, even my dad was out there breaking it down. LJ’s voice is insane, and the whole band had such good vibes, super professional but still fun and laid-back. They nailed every song we asked for and somehow made everything sound even better live. If you want a party, this is the band. No awkward pauses, no cheesy wedding DJ moments, just straight-up good music and good energy. 10/10 would book again.”Jessica T., 3 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/calsix-music)

Airsun Productions 5.0 Oakland, CA

  * DJ
  * Starts at $2,200 

Dj Airsun Aka Ersson Bartle. It’s not a party if people don’t dance. DJ Airsun has been putting people in the mood to groove at parties, events, and clubs since 2011. Airsun’s experience spinning for diverse groups with different tastes means the dancing at weddings and private parties is always a blast and always curated for the people of the hour. “Whether it’s Latin or country, or hip hop or electronic, getting to learn the different styles through new clients, there’s always something new.” Airsun is fluent in an open format, commanding popular music of all eras and styles, so guests of all ages want to get on up and shake it on down.“AJ Airsun did an absolutely wonderful job DJing our wedding and was lovely to work with from start to finish - I would absolutely recommend her to anyone! We wanted a dance party, with songs that get everyone up and moving and she definitely delivered. The setup was perfect, even with the ceremony and reception in two different places (one of which was an outdoor park - they tucked the setup behind a tree!), and included really tasteful and fun mood lighting. My husband even told me about a couple last second changes (adding a new song to the processional while we were all lined up ready to go, and wrapping up one of the dances a little early) that she executed perfectly in the moment. Our reception was at the Outdoor Art Club in Mill Valley - a historic building and small town that both have a lot of rules about sound levels, and it all went perfectly while still feeling like a high energy dance party. We can’t thank Ersson enough!”Christina B., 9 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/airsun-productions)

He was an excellent MC & he truly helped us plan our program out. We had no idea what we wanted as far as a “program,” but he didn’t hesitate to help us create a nice little timeline for our reception! Ardi also took the time to meet with us Via zoom prior to the wedding, to plan out the timeline & also discuss music of course! He provided all the vibes & played us exactly what we wanted. Our guests LOVED the old r&b love songs during dinner, I loved seeing everyone’s faces when he’d play certain songs! The custom light add-ons are definitely worth it too! I highly recommend booking with Party Ardi- not just because he’s our friend, but because he’s simply the best all around!!

He handled the audio for the wedding ceremony itself, MC’d the reception, played the music for the dancing, and also provided uplighting for the event space. Everything he worked on just went smoothly. The audio for the ceremony was high quality and just worked. He did a great job as MC, staying on time, announcing what was happening, and making everyone feel welcome. He did fantastically with the music too - we had a few specific requests, and he nailed them all, but most of the night we gave only vague instructions and he made a ton of great picks, keeping energy high on the dance floor. The uplighting he provided was beautiful as well and really elevated the space! Throughout the process, he was easy to work with, timely, communicated proactively, and was always on top of every little detail. We’d definitely recommend him for anyone looking for a DJ!”Jason G., 4 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/sutherland-entertainment)

Dublin, California.“Had the best time working with David and his wonderful wife for our wedding! We went with The Diamond Package which had many services and added some extras! Each service was 11/10: DJ/MC, Photobooth, boomerang photobooth, Moving Heads On Totems,12 Wireless Uplights, digital monogram, Retro Audio Guestbook, and Cloud Fog Guns! The Fog gums were beyond fun to use, great photo opp where we used in the end and for our send off! All photos that were not picked up from the photobooth were also kept safely for us in the end to collect !Also before closing up each photobooth, they made sure we had at least one photo taken! Now that is what i call amazing service because you get so caught being the show of the wedding and can forget to enjoy what you purchased!! When choosing a DJ, we looked a lot for personality and if the DJ can read the crowd. Our venue had us choose from a list of partners and we chose to work with soundwave a year before our wedding because of David's interaction with us. When speaking to him, you can tell he knows what he's doing and completely understands how budgets work for every couple, and he sure knows all the music to play for each age group. He was able to work with us giving us amazing promos too. David is also very professional and patient! We were pretty last minute in our choices and made some last minute changes as well and David was amazing made it all happen!! So if you're looking for a DJ with many services, go for Sound Wave Mobile DJ! You will not regret it!”Charise I., 4 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/bfe84d07-e61c-4196-895a-3d4115b5ec26?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/sound-wave-mobile-dj)

From the very beginning, Young was SO easy to work with and got right down to asking the right questions to understand what we were looking for in a wedding DJ. Young connected us with DJ TN who was phenomenal to work with. We told TN we want PARTY first, wedding second and he understood exactly what we were looking for! They handled the music, MC, and got our guests' energy up all night. Our guests are still messaging me on how much fun they had! We ended up with their photo booth package which was a great it with everyone. From start to finish, Young was always there to answer our questions and to keep us on track for our wedding day. I cannot recommend Young, DJ TN, and his entire team enough.”Diana, 5 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/a8d48389-a5d0-425d-bf89-9f508015adda?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/twin-spin-entertainment)

He’s professional, reliable and goes out of his way to make everyone’s experience that much more lively and fun! My husband and I got married in the Spring and it took me this long to write a review because I’ve been absolutely lost for words. Through all the crazy BS we had to deal with at the restaurant on our wedding night, Z was 1000% present. From smooth transitions, quirky and sentimental announcements to impromptu dance battles, Zhaldee is the life of any party. He kept eye contact and consistently checked in on us to make sure we were good and staying present. His vibes literally calmed me down so that I can actually enjoy our special day. The icing to our cake was the dance party. The biggest complaint I got from our guests were that their feet hurt from dancing all night! Even my mother in-law said every time she tried to sit down, the DJ was playin’ another hit. Every single guest complimented us on having such a dope DJ and we would recommend Zhaldee for any event!

They went above and beyond by making a special arrangement of our first dance song. We wanted to practice dancing to their rendition before the big day, so Emily shared a recording of it with us which was extremely helpful. Emily is a true professional, helping us organize all of the details and logistics in addition to emceeing for the evening and bringing her gorgeous singing voice, and each member of the band brings their own talents and flair.

We love to share the fun, complexity, and intimacy of chamber music with new audiences.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“I've recommended Bay Area Strings to many of my couples who are looking to add a little atmosphere and beautiful music to their wedding day. They're always professional and on time and add that extra bit of loveliness to the celebration!”Vivian, 5 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/bay-area-strings)
