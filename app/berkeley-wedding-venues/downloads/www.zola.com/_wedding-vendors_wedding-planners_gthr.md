  * ### Mostest Wins - Tea & Cassandra made magic happen

•Verified review

•Amanda M.•Jan 17

Mostest was the BEST decision we made for our New Year's Eve 2025 wedding. The booking process was simple and clear and we understood how it worked right away when we hired them and onboarded. We opted for the Month of Coordinator and were able to interview and select our coordinator in October to begin working together in November in preparation for our wedding. We selected Tea who was an ALL STAR from the start - she deeply, truly cared about my husband and I from day 1 and made it known her priority was not only fulfilling our wedding goals and making the details come to life but making our love story feel special and assuring our day was captured and cherished the way we wanted it to. We also opted for a junior coordinator and got SO LUCKY with Cassandra - another amazing person and excellent solution-oriented coordinator who was high-level, and on top of everything for the wedding day. From the moment we spoke with Tea and set every meeting and spoke through every detail until the very end of our wedding and seeing the items we asked her to pack up bring to our hotel all in an organized box, it was a breeze. Both Tea and Cassandra on wedding day made the impossible, possible - magic happened and every detail we planned had come perfectly to life all because of their quick wit, organized sense of operation and love & care. Even when something went a bit off, they fixed it and made sure it didn't alter any of our plans and kept us calm. They led our ceremony rehearsal and assured our ceremony with a big family and wedding party went perfectly smooth. From photos to cocktail hour to the reception to the dress change and everything in between the schedule of events went perfect on wedding day because of Tea and Cassandra thank you Mostest!

  * ### Julie is the BEST!

•Verified review

•Rex F.•Dec 1, 2025

Julie was such a pleasure to work with as our Custom Design Blueprint Designer, funny story actually we were about to be paired up with someone else and Julie sent a message explaining her background and how it fit PERFECTLY with what we were looking for for our wedding! Julie was super attentive and completely understood exactly our vision for our wedding day and I feel like we were only 5 minutes into our meeting! She is super responsive and has a great eye for detail, we wouldn't have had a complete wedding vision without her. She had a quick turn around with a pinterest board and when we went through it together I was gasping the whole time!! I couldn't breathe!!! hehehe 10/10 and i can't wait to get married, thank you Mostest! For reference photos, we told Julie our theme was LARP/ren faire-esque but we didn't want to go TOO overboard with on-the nose theming, and she absolutely delivered.

  * ### Great experience

•Verified review

•Kayla•Dec 1, 2025

We had a great experience with Mostest! They were super helpful in making sure we had vendors that we felt confident in. Every time we had a question, the Mostest team was helpful and proactive. We used Mostest to book our month of coordinator (Kris G was amazing), jr coordinator (Kirsten, also incredible), content creator (Fran - the best), and the Something Borrowed Blooms set up package (made it so easy). Everyone was amazing and totally exceeded our expectations! Would highly recommend using Mostest to book vendors - it was one of the best investments we made.

  * ### Groom

•Verified review

•Kyle M.•Nov 26, 2025

Emily M. was a 10/10. We had a special, intimate, but highly detailed 190-person wedding at home. We had to bring in a ton of different vendors, change locations twice, and deal with very unpredictable weather. Emily was a total star – from the first planning call to hugging her goodbye at the end of the after party. Cannot recommend her highly enough!
