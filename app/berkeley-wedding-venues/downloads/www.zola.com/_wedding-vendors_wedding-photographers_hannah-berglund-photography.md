I'm Hannah, a full time wedding and portrait photographer in Livermore, California. To me, photography is so much more than just hiring another vendor. And that's why you should choose someone you truly love to work with! I believe the real magic happens during the in-between moments – a secret smile shared by the parents; a tearful hug with the maid of honor; a quirky moment with the best man. These memories are far more precious than any staged photo, and these are the memories I want to capture for you on your big day.

I do not believe you have to sacrifice the genuine and the real for the sake of a high-end, sophisticated experience - especially when it comes to a wedding! I believe you should have the wedding of your dreams while still embracing the joy and the excitement of your love story and feeling the freedom to be yourself. I provide a high-end experience that captures each and every authentic, intimate moment of your wedding day.

  * ### Spirit of our big day

•Verified review

•Emma and J.•Feb 12, 2023

I cannot say enough about how happy we are we hired Hannah as our wedding photographer! Once I saw her work I knew we had to work with her immediately, specifically for the sunset photos that looked right out of a bridal magazine! I immediately reached out to Hannah and pretty much the rest is history! Our phone call to gauge if we would be a good fit was filled with laughs and it just felt so natural! She was extremely communicative and easy to work with which helped with all my wedding planning anxieties tremendously. The engagement shots with her was where we first got to meet and it felt like meeting a true friend. She had us laughing non-stop and made us feel truly comfortable. We felt awkward on our drive over, having never done professional photos before, but she immediately put us at ease! On the day of the wedding Hannah and her team were so kind, so efficient, and so professional! We had a large (read here rowdy) wedding party and some difficult family dynamics that they expertly navigated. Their team made sure everyone just truly was themselves and had fun! The pictures showed just how comfortable and happy everyone was in her presence. The photos truly captured the spirit of our big day and transport us right back there every time we look through them. Our family and friends we have shared the photos with are absolutely amazed and just how well they turned out and how much they feel like our big day did. I cannot recommend Hannah and her team enough! Truly the best decision we made!

  * ### Amazing Photographer

•Verified review

•Kiley•Nov 30, 2022

Hannah was so amazing from start to finish. She made both me and my husband feel so at ease during our initial engagement shoot. We are not photo people, so we felt super awkward at first, but Hannah was able to get us laughing right away and the photos came out amazing. As we approached our wedding day, Hannah ensured she reached out to touch base and walk us through everything we would need for the day of. I was blown away by her organization. The day of was perfect. Both her and her assistant, AJ, were the perfect people to shoot our day. We had a issues (i misplaced a few items that needed to be shot) and Hannah ensured me to not worry and was able to get everything we needed. The boys were raving about AJ when they arrived at the venue. Hannah was able to get every single photo we requested and I am so happy with how they turned out. By the end, we really felt like Hannah was a good friend who happened to be our photographer. I cannot recommend Hannah enough for any bride to be.

  * ### The Easiest and Best Decision!

Picking a wedding photographer is likely the most challenging vendor, many of your wedding memories are in their hands. My husband and I Zoom-interviewed countless photographers and we immediately cancelled every other interview / photographer hold after getting off our call with Hannah. Even over video, we felt like old friends. Throughout the wedding preparation process, we met and took photos with Hannah to get to know each other in person. We had a great time hanging out, making jokes, and all the while, getting outstanding "engagement" photos (we had already sent out a save-the-date). Hannah was also an expert at wrangling our pup, who loved to sniff and ignore the camera. Leading up to our wedding, she shared really helpful tools, which assisted us in outlining our wedding day and advising other vendors. Hannah checked in on us and regularly met with us over Zoom to make sure we were all on track. Unlike some of our other prep calls, we really looked forward to our prep sessions with Hannah. The day of our wedding, Hannah went out of her way to make it a success. When our florist insisted on delivering flowers later, Hannah picked up an extra bouquet to photograph with our details. She has an impressive wedding industry history, so she actually knew one of our vendors already and despite meeting the rest of the first time, she seamlessly flowed with all of them. She immediatley went to work with our wedding coordinator, but also adding to the camraderie and fun of "getting ready". She even advised and dealt with our very challenging videographer, who consistently got in her way. I can't imagine having anyone else so intimately involved with our wedding day as Hannah. I was looking forward to 1:1 moments with my husband the most, and Hannah made sure to prioritize those moments for us, capturing every ounce of excitement and bliss. Those moments are my most treasured of the day, and I actually really enjoyed having her there for them, because she is such a special person (and now friend)! She knows exactly how to handle anything thrown at her on wedding day. I can't recommend Hannah enough for your wedding experience. If you're looking for a truly special memory of your day, you will not only come out with hundreds of incredible photos, but you'll leave with a great new friend.

  * ### LOVED working with Hannah!

•Verified review

•Alex•Jul 24, 2020

Hannah captured our day beautifully. She was really easy to work with and it was such a relief to find a photographer we were so comfortable with. I was extremely picky when it came with choosing a photographer - I searched forever before finding Hannah and felt an instant connection when we spoke. Our search stopped there as we knew she was who we wanted at our wedding! I was really nervous for the engagement session but felt instantly at ease as soon as we begin shooting. She made my fiance (at the time) and I extremely comfortable and the session was actually really fun (not that we expected it to not be fun haha.... we were both just so nervous that we were scared for how it would go!). We had numerous guests compliment us for hiring her because of how delightful she was to have at the wedding. A few of our bridesmaids actually hired her to capture their wedding after working with her! I truly can't recommend her enough - Hannah is an absolute gem!

## Frequently asked questions

12 Answers

Ask them a question

### How long does it take to get my completed online album?

You will receive your final wedding album within 4-6 weeks.

### How many digital files will I receive? Can I print them myself?

You will receive an average of 75-100 edited digital photos per hour that I’m shooting. You will have the ability to print, share and download your images as much as you want, wherever you want! I also offer an online store with affordable print pricing so you know you are getting the highest quality print possible.

### How would you describe your shooting style?

I love being both interactive and discreet throughout the wedding day. There will be parts of the day when I will need to be in control to stay on schedule. There will also be moments when you shouldn’t even know that I’m there (the ceremony, during dances and toasts, etc.). I teach you how to pose and interact naturally so you are comfortable on the wedding day!

### How far do you travel?

Up to 60 miles of travel are included for weddings. Additional mileage for weddings is $1/mile outside of zipcode 94550

### How do we book our date with you?

The first step is to schedule a call to get to know one another better and for me to answer any questions you might have. To reserve your wedding date, I just ask for a completed online contract and a 50% non-refundable retainer.

### What is your reschedule policy?

If you are forced to reschedule your wedding due to COVID, or another reason entirely, I will work with you to find a new date where I am available. I do not charge a fee to reschedule and 100% of your retainer will be moved to the new date.

### Do you work with an assistant or second shooter?

Yes, I always bring a second photographer with me to weddings. I will occasionally bring an assistant as well if you have a very large guest count.

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically, couples book me about 13 -18 months before their wedding date. I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible about my availability, even if you’re planning on a shorter time frame.

### Will you edit all our pictures?

Definitely. All final images will be edited for color, saturation, exposure, and sharpness to ensure they look beautiful.

### Do you also offer video services?

No, I prefer focusing on photography only, so you can get the best wedding pictures possible.

### Do you have insurance?

I do! Just let me know if your venue requires a certificate of liability, and I’ll send that over to them.

### What’s your back-up plan if you can’t photograph our wedding as planned?

In all my years of experience as a wedding photographer, I’ve never canceled a booking. In the very rare event that I’m unable to photograph your wedding, I’ll make sure you’re covered by one of my colleagues or my contracted assistant. I’ll also provide you with a list of photographers from the many networking groups I’m in, so you can find the perfect replacement.
