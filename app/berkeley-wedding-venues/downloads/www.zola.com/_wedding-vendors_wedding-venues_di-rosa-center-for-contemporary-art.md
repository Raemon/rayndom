## About this venue

IMAGINE YOUR EVENT AT DI ROSA... di Rosa Center for Contemporary Art occupies 217 acres of the original 465 acres of land purchased by Rene di Rosa in 1960. Located in the scenic Carneros Region at the south end of the Napa Valley, di Rosa opened to the public in 1997 as part of Rene di Rosa's vision for an “art park” accessible to the greater public, the property now encompasses multiple galleries, a lush courtyard, and a sculpture meadow that are all protected in perpetuity under the Napa County Land Trust. di Rosa is pleased to hold private events on the property, including corporate events, retreats, meetings, birthdays, and private rentals.
