## Frequently asked questions

6 Answers

Ask them a question

### What ages do you provide care for?

We provide care for all ages. Our team is experienced in working with a wide range of ages and developmental stages, and we will tailor activities and supervision to fit each child’s needs.

### Are your caregivers background-checked and trained?

Absolutely. All our caregivers are thoroughly background-checked, CPR/First Aid certified, and trained in child safety and age-appropriate engagement. Many are educators, childcare professionals, or long-time nannies with years of hands-on experience.

### Do you bring your own toys and supplies?

Yes! We come fully prepared with age-appropriate toys, games, books, art activities, and comfort items. Everything is clean, safe, and curated to match the vibe of your event – from quiet corners for naps to creative fun for energetic little ones.

### Where do you set up the childcare space?

We will work with you (or your planner/venue) to select a quiet, safe, and convenient location at or near your event site. Whether it’s a private room, a suite, or a cozy corner near the action, we will create a playful and secure environment your tiny guests will love.

### Can you accommodate special needs or allergies?

Yes, we do our best to accommodate all children. During our planning process, we will gather important details about your young guests including any allergies, medical needs, or special care instructions so every child is safe and supported.

### How far in advance should we book?

The earlier, the better especially for busy wedding seasons! We recommend reaching out at least 2–3 months in advance to ensure availability, but don’t hesitate to contact us if your timeline is tighter and we will do our best to help support you on your big day!
