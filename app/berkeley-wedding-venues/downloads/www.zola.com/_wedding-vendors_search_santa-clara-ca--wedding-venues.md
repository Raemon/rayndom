Desde el primer día que fuimos a conocer las instalaciones, el señor Gary fue muy atento y respetuoso, contestó a todas nuestras dudas. Tal vez nuestro evento fue algo fuera de lo común, a diferencia de los eventos de boda que se organizan aquí, nosotros contratamos el granero para el 25 de Diciembre para celebrar los 15 años de mi hija , sabemos que son días festivos donde la gente está con su familia , más sin embargo recibimos todo su apoyo para que el evento se hiciera realidad en este día tan especial , puedo decirles que fue una experiencia maravillosa, fue en evento de ensueño y de igual manera nos hospedamos en la casa, donde realmente nos sentimos como en nuestro hogar , sinceramente todas las instalaciones estuvieron limpias en todo momento, Gary estuvo al pendiente de si necesitábamos algo y al igual si la empresa que contratamos para la planeación necesitaban apoyo. Quiero animar a todos los papás que deseen hacerle su quinceañera a su hija, que consideren contratar los servicios de Suisun Valley Inn, ya que harán que su hija viva una experiencia única y de ensueño, no se arrepentirán. Sr Gary agradezco todas sus atenciones y muy pronto estaremos trabajando con usted para los 15 años de mi otra hija… Bendiciones”Fabiola M., 22 days ago![](https://images.zola.com/0dbc73ce-706c-4f4e-8b41-7324823426c8?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/suisun-valley-inn-at-monroe-ranch)

Jennifer and Priscilla was a pleasure to work with from start to finish. Even when I added a bunch of things last minute. They were able to help with all my questions. The venue is stunning and packaged vendors were just wonderful. This was my dream wedding. If I could change anything it would be to allow the food to stay out all night or just longer than 90 minutes. Also, if I could have gotten into the bridal suite to actually get my makeup done that would have been a nice touch. But that’s minor. The suite was lovely and spacious enough for my immediate family to do our touch ups and change. The drinks were nice and strong. This was the best day ever!”Latosha G., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/47ede32b-edb2-4b05-a54b-600c6c8b5608?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/eagle-ridge-by-wedgewood-weddings)

“We had our wedding reception at Fogo de Chão, San Jose in 2022, and it was an incredible event! We were looking for a venue that was all inclusive: food, drinks, tables, chairs, etc. This definitely simplified the process for us. The planning process was smooth and very flexible with their events team as well. There are great food and drink packages to choose from, they are very flexible with table arrangements, and they are very transparent about pricing. There were a couple of event management personnel changes throughout our planning process, but on their end, they made sure to honor our previous arrangements. They also worked very well with our month-of coordinator we hired. Overall, I would definitely recommend a restaurant buyout for a wedding at Fogo! The atmosphere was cozy, the food was incredible, and the restaurant is beautiful and chic requiring no extra decor on our end. Our guests raved about the food afterwards, and told us it was the best wedding they had been to!”Isabela F., 3 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/fogo-de-chao-san-jose-ca)

From start to finish, the entire experience was seamless and truly exceptional. A huge shoutout to Manoj, who coordinated everything to absolute perfection! From the drinks menu to the décor, food, and every tiny detail, he ensured that everything was executed flawlessly. His professionalism, attentiveness, and dedication made all the difference, allowing us to simply enjoy our special day without a single worry. The venue itself is stunning, with elegant décor, ample space, and a warm ambiance that set the perfect tone for our celebration. The catering was phenomenal, with a delicious spread that our guests couldn’t stop raving about. The food was fresh, well-presented, and customized to our preferences, making the dining experience truly delightful. A special mention to DJ Ellis, who absolutely rocked the night! His energy, music selection, and ability to keep the dance floor alive made the party an absolute blast. The dance floor was electric, and our guests had the time of their lives dancing the night away! A big thank you to Hugo for crafting amazing drinks that kept the spirits high throughout the night! His skill and creativity behind the bar made the experience even more special for our guests.

“We hosted our October 2023 Wedding Reception at The Tech Interactive and I highly recommend it to anybody who is looking for a unique (and literally interactive) venue. It was so much fun and our guests had a great time! We rented the entire lower level and they kept the galleries and exhibits open so our guests could play with them throughout the night! They were a hit during cocktail hour as well as for taking breaks from the dance floor (although we still always had plenty of people on the dance floor!) Our event was mostly adults with a handful of younger relatives, and everyone had a great time. The exhibits at The Tech Interactive are perfect for quick and fun interactions no matter how interested (or not interested) any individual guest was in science/technology. Our engineer friends had a great time with the Cyber Detectives activities, while even our least technically-inclined guests enjoyed playing around with things like the Jet Pack Chair and Solve For Earth. This was truly best of both worlds, as we didn't have to give up any of the "traditional" wedding elements to make room for the fun of the exhibits - our tables and decorations were set up beautifully, we still had appetizers and an open bar, and like I mentioned above, there were still always plenty of people on the dance floor! We actually didn't even need to decorate as much as we might have with a more "traditional" venue either, as the existing colors, lighting, and layout of The Tech make for a strong baseline to build from. Our primary contact was Lolita and she was extremely helpful and pleasant to work with. She was there with us every step of the way, from our initial tour to our reception itself. She made sure to consider exactly what we were looking for to make our wedding special and was extremely organized and great and communicating with us as well as our other vendors. She created a great layout based on our table count, dance floor size, and the space the caterer needed, and she and her team went above and beyond and worked with our caterer and coordinator to help set everything up between the public close time and the start of our event so that everything was perfect when our guests got there. They even let us customize the exterior lighting color of the building during our event. The physical location of The Tech Interactive is fantastic as well - right in downtown San Jose within walking distance of tons of hotels and two parking garages where The Tech validates. The city closed off Market Street right in front of The Tech relatively last minute for a public city event, but Lolita was on top of it and worked with us and our shuttle company to arrange for pickup and a smooth experience for our guests. In summary: If you're looking to do something unique with your wedding or event, I can't recommend The Tech Interactive enough.

## About wedding venues in Santa Clara, CA

### 

California offers an incredible 840 miles of coastline, 3,000+ wineries and ancient redwoods for your wedding day. When you choose the Golden State, you're getting exceptional natural lighting for your ceremony across diverse settings from Mediterranean coastal zones to alpine mountain backdrops. Each region has its own distinctive character that can perfectly match your vision.

### What Makes California Wedding Venues So Special?

Northern California's Napa Valley welcomes you with rolling vineyards and Spanish colonial architecture where intimate wine cave ceremonies create unforgettable moments. Head to Southern California and you'll find oceanfront venues like Duke's Malibu where you can exchange vows with the Pacific stretching out behind you while enjoying fresh coastal-inspired cuisine. Palm Springs offers dramatic desert venues with mountain backdrops and striking midcentury modern architecture that photographs beautifully.

### How Much Do Wedding Venues in California Cost?

Wedding venues in California typically run between $9,600 and $11,700 which aligns nicely with the national range of $6,500-$12,000. This represents about 18% of your total wedding budget. Your overall costs will vary based on guest count:

  * 50 guests: $26,190
  * 100 guests: $43,692

Accessibility options have improved greatly across California venues in recent years.

### When Should You Book Your California Wedding Venue?

October leads venue inquiries in California with couples typically booking venues about 13 months (400 days) before their wedding date. If you're dreaming of a Northern California wine country wedding during peak season you'll want to book up to 18 months in advance. Southern California venues offer more flexibility especially during winter months when you can still enjoy beautiful weather while potentially securing better rates.
