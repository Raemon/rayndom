  * ### The Best Wedding Planner We Could Have Asked For

•Verified review

•Vinithi K.•Sep 21, 2025

I don’t even know where to begin or how to fully express my gratitude for everything Amanda did for us. From our very first virtual meeting, I felt an instant connection—it truly felt like fate to have found her through Zola. What started as a simple City Hall ceremony in San Francisco quickly evolved into a full Indian wedding celebration: a traditional ceremony, a reception, and then City Hall two days later. These changes weren’t minor, and they came with their fair share of challenges—but Amanda handled everything with such ease, professionalism, and grace that the process remained smooth, stress-free, and even fun. Within just a few months of our first meeting, we had secured all of our major vendors. Amanda was the driving force behind that momentum. She communicated with everyone on our behalf, managed all the logistics, and kept things moving forward—always making sure to reach out only when decisions were needed. As someone who struggles to keep up with email during the workday, this was a huge relief. Amanda’s organization and communication skills are truly unmatched. Every detail was accounted for, every deadline met, and every piece of the puzzle fit together perfectly. On top of all this, I was lucky enough to have her as our on-site coordinator on the big day—and I can't imagine having gone through it without her. She made sure everything ran seamlessly. There were zero issues, and everything looked more beautiful than I ever could’ve dreamed. Most importantly, she gave me the gift of being fully present on our wedding day. I didn’t have to worry about a thing—just focus on my husband, our families, and the joy of the moment. Our wedding weekend was perfect, and that’s in large part thanks to Amanda. She brought together the most amazing vendor team and ensured that the entire weekend was unforgettable. And let me just add—Amanda was eight months pregnant and still went above and beyond to make sure every detail was perfect. Her dedication to her clients is truly extraordinary. Amanda, thank you from the bottom of our hearts. You were the heart and soul of our wedding team, and we’re forever grateful.

My florals were my absolute favorite décor element from my entire wedding. They made me so happy because they were absolutely perfect, and I credit that entirely to Amanda’s dedication and collaboration with Emporio, the preferred floral vendor at Hard Rock Los Cabos. Florals were the wedding detail I cared about the most, and they also caused me the most worry. They hold such a special place in my heart because I believe they truly accentuate the beauty of a wedding. From the moment Amanda stepped in, she eased all my anxieties. She was dedicated, focused, and meticulous in her attention to detail. She was assertive in communicating my needs to the vendor, efficient in coordinating every step, proactive in addressing potential challenges, and direct in making sure my vision was honored exactly as I imagined. Her strong and trusted relationship with Emporio made all the difference. They clearly respect and value her, which ensured flawless execution and also saved me thousands of dollars. That kind of value comes from her experience, credibility, and deep commitment to her clients. Because of Amanda, my my most treasured design element was in the very best hands. If you have the opportunity to work with her, I recommend it wholeheartedly. She is worth every penny and more.

  * ### The Wedding of Our Dreams, Thanks to Amanda!

•Verified review

•Misa A.•Jun 17, 2025

My husband and I cannot thank Amanda enough for making our wedding at Hard Rock Hotel Los Cabos truly magical! From our very first conversation, she understood our vision for decor and florals and brought it to life in a way that exceeded all expectations. What made the experience even more seamless was that Amanda had actually been a past bride at the same resort. She knew the vendors, venues, and all the resort’s policies inside and out. That kind of firsthand knowledge was invaluable and made a huge difference throughout the planning process. Amanda took so much stress off our hands! She kept us on track with timelines, coordinated directly with the resort’s vendors, and made sure every detail was thoughtfully handled. She was incredibly professional, responsive, organized, and truly cared about making our day perfect. Even with the challenges of planning a destination wedding, she made everything feel easy, smooth, and even fun! If you’re planning a wedding, we wholeheartedly recommend Amanda. She understands the entire experience from both the bride’s and the planner’s perspective. She truly helped us create the wedding of our dreams, and we are forever grateful for Amanda’s creativity, hard work, and passion.

  * ### Best Wedding Ever 

•Verified review

•Calin E.•May 10, 2025

Amanda Antonetti Events was absolutely amazing to work with for our wedding. They provided high quality service and were extremely detailed oriented, which made our special day go off without a hitch. Amanda is the best wedding planner - she was willing to meet with us often to discuss all the wedding details and had great recommendations for vendors like our surprise saxophonist. I could not have had such an amazing day without Amanda's hard work and kindness. I am highly recommending Amanda Antonetti Events to all my friends.

## Frequently asked questions

13 Answers

Ask them a question

### Why do I need a wedding planner?

A wedding planner can help couples plan and execute their wedding from start to finish, including creating a budget, finding vendors, etc. They can also help reduce stress and ensure the wedding is memorable.

### What is included in wedding planning services?

A wedding planner manages all wedding tasks except for the day of the wedding, including budget, timeline, design, vendor research, and guest assistance.

### Is in-person coordination provided for event planning?

Amanda Antonetti Events takes pride in providing comprehensive coordination and planning services prior to the event day. While many venues now include on-site day-of coordination, if your venue does not provide this service, we would be happy to discuss potential additional coordination. However, physical on-site coordination is not included in our standard package offerings and is offered as a seperate package for this reason.

### Will you provide hand-off documentation for vendors who may need them?

Yes, of course!

### How much time do you need to plan?

Most couples start planning their wedding 12 to 15 months in advance, with the majority of the intensive planning and bookings happening around 10 months before the big day. However, the timeline can vary greatly depending on factors like the desired venue's availability, the complexity of the wedding, and whether you're planning a local or destination wedding.

### Do you have vendor references or partnerships?

Yes, I have cultivated relationships with various trusted vendors in the wedding industry, which can often translate to preferential treatment or discounts for my clients. I'm also continually expanding my network to offer my clients an even wider range of high-quality, reliable vendor options.

### Do you send save the dates or invitations on our behalf?

No, sending save-the-dates and invitations is not a service I currently offer as part of my virtual wedding planning package. However, I can guide you through the process, provide design input, and recommend reliable printers or stationers. For an additional fee, I can manage the mailing process on your behalf if you desire.

### Do you handle professional services, contracts and payment processing?

Yes, I assist with vendor connections, contract negotiations, and reviewing contracts to ensure they align with your interests and expectations. However, to maintain financial transparency and security, I do not handle payment processing directly. All payments to vendors will be made by you unless we have a prior written agreement stating otherwise.

### Are you willing to step in as our advocate, conveying our visions and desires to pros when we can't?

Absolutely, 100%. As your wedding planner, I consider it a core part of my role to be your advocate, conveying your vision, desires, and concerns to vendors when you can't or prefer not to. This ensures your wedding truly reflects your unique style and wishes, even when you're busy or unavailable.

### Do you have insurance?

Currently, no, as it is often times not required by venues. I am exploring policies though, to further protect my clients' interests if needed.

### Do you offer design services or styling advice?

Design guidance is included in my full planning packages, featuring mood boards to visualize your wedding style.

### Can you help with guest list management and RSVP tracking?

I provide my couples with the necessary tools to maintain and track their guest lists. However, I do not directly work with guests and receive this information directly. It would be up to the couple to maintain their responses in the tools provided.

### How often will we communicate during the planning process?

Full planning investments come with unlimited calls and access to me as your wedding planner. We will schedule monthly cadence calls when we start the onboarding process.
