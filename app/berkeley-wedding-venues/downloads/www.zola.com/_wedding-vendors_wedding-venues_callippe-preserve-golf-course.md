  * ### Best Wedding Ever!

•Verified review

•Emily R.•Nov 9, 2025

Callippe did a fantastic job!! I loved every second of the planning with them and how smooth they made everything. They were very accommodating and very cost effective! We love Morgan and Charissa so much! They are responsive and super helpful. If I were you, I’d book them!

  * ### Could not have asked for a better venue team

•Verified review

•Becky M.•May 25, 2025

Callippe Preserve Golf Course was an absolute dream venue for our wedding! From the moment we first reached out, Morgan Chandler and her team were friendly, responsive, and kind throughout the entire planning process. They went above and beyond to ensure our special day was gorgeous and professional in every way. When we encountered a few bumps along the way, they took care of it right away without any fuss. The staff at the venue was incredible as well! Setting up all of our decor, serving dinner and everything in between took so much stress off of my plate and I will always be so grateful! The venue itself was breathtaking, and our guests raved about the beautiful scenery and fantastic service. We are so grateful to the Callippe Preserve team for helping to make our wedding day truly unforgettable.

  * ### Callippe's Events Team is A

•Verified review

•Cindy L.•Jan 24, 2025

From the moment we reached out to the team at Callippe Preserve Golf Course, they were incredibly responsive and helpful via email. Their communication throughout the planning process was top-notch, and they were always available to answer any questions we had. The venue itself was the perfect size - spacious enough to accommodate our guest list, but not too big that it felt like a high school gym. The views of the golf course and surrounding hills were absolutely beautiful, providing a gorgeous backdrop for our ceremony and reception. The set-up and clean-up teams were also fantastic, ensuring everything ran smoothly on the day of our wedding. We couldn't have asked for a better venue to celebrate our special day.
