Casey Peek is the founder of Peek Media, where he crafts cinematic, story-driven wedding films with an authentic, documentary touch. Based in the Bay Area, Casey captures real moments with heart and artistry, creating films that let you feel your day all over again.“Peek Media captured the vibe of our small wedding in a way that’s allowed us to go back and relive the day time and time again. They were a natural and unobtrusive fit during the actual day. Their videographers were easy to work with and blended into the background. Despite their minimalist presence they managed to get all of the rights shots to capture the most important moments throughout the ceremony and reception. We were impressed that our videos managed to include all of our guests and gave us a sense of what was going on at places that we didn’t have the time to be at during the actual day. As a bonus they worked well with our photographer and other vendors. They were a natural part of the overall program and contributed towards lowering stress and keeping the day moving along seamlessly. We were thrilled with a short recap video included in our package that was edited to a main song we used in our wedding- easily accessible to share with family and friends. Thank you for creating great memories for us!”Laura & O., 19 days ago![](https://images.zola.com/3f47ca30-3427-4267-b40e-8ca97b348bd0?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-videographers/peek-media)

I’m Colin Pattison, owner and filmmaker at Featherstone Wedding Films. I film weddings because I believe in the power of marriage, and I have a passion for capturing special moments on film. I’ve helped countless couples create their ideal wedding film for over 10 years. My goal is to capture lasting memories through beautiful, personalized wedding films. From first consultation, to finished film, I’ll be with you every step of the way.“Colin was probably one of the easiest vendors to work with. We chatted on the phone to get to know him, sent him our deposit and that was that! We talked a bit leading up to the wedding, but he and my photographer communicated to get on the same page/ timeline so I didn’t have to stress much about that either. The day of, him and his team were wonderful all day. They themselves were professional, and all his gear was as well. One of the things I appreciated most about Colin was his ability to be everywhere to get footage, but he was secretive about it, so those that are shy on camera didn’t feel pressured. My videos I got were AMAZING. I don’t know how many times we have watched the videos together or how many I’ve watched it alone but, every time feels like the first. It’s beautiful work and truly captured our wedding day and our personalities. We also got raw footage from him that had us cackling. It’s awesome seeing the day again through both the finished product and the raw footage. Thank you Colin for everything. I highly recommend Colin to everyone!!”Aubrey G., 9 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/d109b045-b058-4538-8d42-2fbbe8366a5b?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-videographers/featherstone-wedding-films)

Hi couple! My name is Nelvir Aquino, a wedding videographer based in Northern California. My mission is to leave you with a wedding video that makes you smile when you're older, cry when you need it and overall a video that reminds you what a special day your wedding was.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“My wife and I worked with Nelvir for only about 2-3 months prior to our wedding due to us having to go through the fiancé visa process. However, even with everything being so last minute and things changing all the time, he was very understanding and patient with us, which made it so easy to work with him. His laid-back personality was great to work with before the wedding. However, when the photo shoot starts and you see him doing his magic through his camera, you can tell how much passion he has for his work. I'm an amateur photographer myself but seeing him and the photographers (which they've never met before) working in sync made me realize that professional photographers/videographers are on a different level of professionalism once they start their shoot. Not only are they quick with their hands, the way they came up with creative angles was impressive. After the wedding, he kept the deadline he promised with the teaser and highlight video. We just got our physical copy today and were impressed by how much detail he puts into his clients. Nelvir, it was such a privilege working with you the past few months. We enjoyed having you be a part of our special day and wish you the best of luck in your photography/videography business!! We will be sure to recommend you to our friends and family if they're in need of a videographer!”Joseph Y., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-videographers/nelvir-pictures)

So what does finisterre mean? Finisterre is Latin. If you know some Spanish, you’ll recognize two words squeezed into one: “fin” and “tierra,” essentially meaning the world’s end. Don’t worry, not in an apocalyptic sense of the word — it’s actually a place. It’s where the Romans once stood in modern-day Spain. They looked across the vast Atlantic Ocean, and thought to themselves “is this the end of the road?” Finisterre is an ode to that majestic feeling of unknown. Getting married is one of those unique experiences.“I cannot recommend Ryan and his team enough. 100/5 stars. He was absolutely AMAZING on our wedding day at the Hideout. Our wedding video is hands down, one of the greatest memories we have from our day. Ryan was able to capture the whole day without shoving a camera in our faces. My husband and I were able to actually enjoy the day and visit with everyone without having to miss any major moments for a film shoot. He blended with our crowd so effortlessly while capturing all the detailed moments throughout the whole day. Not only that, but Ryan and his team had to be adaptable during our wedding day. We had rain and hail which altered all of our plans for the ceremony and reception, but Ryan was able to shift and still capture the day beautifully. He was very communicative with editing our video and checked in to make sure we were happy with the final result. The care and detail he put into our video was so reflective of us - I can't thank him enough.”Avery B., a year ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-videographers/finisterre-visuals)

Hi, I’m Ethan, the filmmaker behind Ether Weddings! I’ve spent over a decade in the film industry, and over the years I’ve learned that the most powerful stories are the real ones. My goal is simple: to capture your wedding in a way that feels genuine, cinematic, and full of heart. I focus on the small moments, the laughter, and the quiet looks that make your story yours. I create wedding films that let you relive your day exactly how it felt.“We hired Ethan for our wedding, and I genuinely could not be happier with how everything turned out. From the first conversation, he was professional, organized, and truly took the time to understand our vision. On the wedding day, they blended in seamlessly—never intrusive, but always somehow in the right spot at the right time. The final video absolutely blew us away. The editing, the music, the little candid moments we didn’t even realize were being captured… everything felt cinematic, emotional, and beautifully put together. Watching it felt like reliving the best day of our lives all over again, and our families were literally in tears. All I can say is: if you’re on the fence, book him. He cares about the craft, he cares about couples, and it really shows in every single frame. Easily one of the best investments we made for our wedding.

I grew up in Bakersfield, California and studied business management and marketing at Western Dakota Technical Institute in Rapid City, South Dakota. I have almost 20 years of real world experience in graphic design, web design, videography/editing and photography and owned a successful business in South Dakota. I have enjoyed being a music producer/promoter and club DJ, producing and documenting several of my own events, from Zombie Walk's to political rallies since 1999. I moved back to California in 2015 to pursue my passion for film and the arts, Fresh is a culmination of the two.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“If you are wanting a wedding video, Fresh Wedding Cinematography is who you will want to hire to capture your beautiful day.

  * Storytelling style
  * Serves Berkeley, CA

I started Matter Video because I am passionate about people and making videos. I want to make videos that matter (I promise that is the only time I will use that play on words in this section). My goal is to create videos that capture moments and stories that are significant to you: your wedding day, your organization, your company, your story. I have been making videos since 2000 and I teach Leadership at a local high school. When I am not making videos, I like to travel and spend time with my wife and 3 kids. They are much cuter than me.“Matter Video is my favorite video team to work with! It can be quite a dance between photography & videography and this team makes it feel effortless. Not to mention, their walkie talkies super cool (& useful). This team creates stunning work all while creating a fun atmosphere on wedding days. You'll be thrilled, I promise.”Cheers Babe Photo, 6 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-videographers/matter-video)

Hi! Courtney here (that's me on the left!). Shutter and Sound is the brainchild of renowned wedding videographer Ryan Geldermann. Ryan began his wedding videography career in 2010 in Los Angeles and quickly became recognized as one of the top videographers in the U.S.. After relocating to DC and still receiving countless inquiries from all corners of the country, Ryan decided to recruit and train a few talented friends so he could continue offering the quality wedding videography he’s known for in SoCal and eventually over 10 cities. Shutter and Sound is a very small group of filmmakers dedicated to turning your big day into a work of art.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We are thrilled with the stunning work of Shutter and Sound! Their highly talented videographers perfectly captured all the love and memories of our wedding day, and helped preserve them in film. Reliving the day by watching our highlight video brought us and our family to tears of joy. Every beautiful moment was captured with crystal-clear visuals from getting ready with our wedding attendants to our sparkler send off at the end of the night. The drone footage and details shots also perfectly blended with the rest of the film and helped set the stage for our perfect day. We can’t thank Shutter and Sound enough for the creativity and care they put into making our wedding video.
