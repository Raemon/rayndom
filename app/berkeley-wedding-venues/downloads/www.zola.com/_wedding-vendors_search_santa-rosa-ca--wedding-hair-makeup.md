Welcome. “When you look beautiful you feel beautiful, and it’s creating that kind of happiness that is magical to me.” Enhancing natural beauty is foremost in my mind when I work. I am a makeup artist with over 15 years of experience in the areas of fashion shows, television, music videos, weddings, and special events. My vast experience has helped me blossom into an artist who can help each client transform into their most fierce self. I empower every single client I work with and it’s truly what makes me love my job as an artist.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Makeup by Masara was an absolute dream to work with for my wedding day. From the very first conversation, their communication style was transparent and kind, putting me at ease throughout the entire process. The quality of their work was truly above and beyond - they made me feel beautiful without the makeup feeling "caked on." The look was very natural but still noticeable, which was exactly what I was going for. Masara is phenomenal at what she does and is perfect for brides who don't wear a lot of makeup day-to-day. I was thrilled with the final result and have already referred Makeup by Masara to my 2025 bride friends!”Gabriella G., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/6b6ef2b6-4af7-4063-afc8-a4edf2475284?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/makeup-by-masara)

Look no further! Celeste is absolutely amazing. I was stuck in fonding someone that could really bring my vision to life for my day. I wanted to have soft glam waves and not look like my hear was immovable and break off ( could be trauma from all my years of scribing my hair). From the moment we connected - thanks to my wedding day coordinator’s help- she was friendly, calm, answered ALL my questions, and truly made me feel at ease. She was communicative, and very well organized- I was indecisive over my style and unfortunately, in a bind with scheduling a trial. She was flexible in her hair trial option, but my life was just chaos and I wasn’t able to go for a trial- even still. I was absolutely amazed with my hair! She provided hair prep details the day prior, to make sure my hair was in great condition for the mornring of. On the day of, she arrived with all her cargo in tow and set up to put her magic to work/ I felt like a celebrity- truly. She made me a bridal gift bag, which was a super sweet and unexpected gift of some day of necessities complete with eye masks. She managed doing hair for me and my bridal party and made my mom feel very comfortable and at esse as she has NEVER had her hair done before. My hair looked just as I had imagined & Celestes attention to details, consideration for my needs, and management of time was absolutely PHENOMENAL- I don’t know how she does it! My hair held up- despite all the wind and even at the end of the night, while a bit chaotic - it was a true testament that this bride had a BLAST at her wedding! I am incredibly grateful my coordinator found Celeste & I have followed closely along at all her work since my day because the post wedding blues are DEFINITELY hitting! Thank you Celeste for making me feel so incredibly beautiful!

Beauty stems from the inside and that’s where we start with our babes. We want our couples to feel like an elevated version of themselves. We are all about complimenting the mood and aesthetic of your wedding weekend while coming up with a custom look that brings it all together. With the mama wolf, Ash having over a decade of editorial and fashion experience, our work is more fashion-forward than “bridal”. Highlighting natural beauty above all. Because we work so closely with our photographers, we know how to help you feel photo ready while still feeling “approachable”. We are stoked to be considered for your beauty needs!“I hired Love Wolves Co for my hair and make up and had the best experience with them! Karen was my stylist and she did such an amazing job both for my engagement shoot and wedding day! As someone who never wears more than some mascara, she really allowed me to still feel natural and like myself while highlighting my features and ensuring my make up would photograph well. In fact, she did such a great job with make up for me and my bridesmaids that my step-mom (who typically hates getting her make up done) added that service day of! Knowing that my fine hair doesn’t hold well, I had Karen stay for a touch up right before my ceremony and couldn’t recommend that enough! Everyone loved working with her!”Anais P., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/love-wolves-co-beauty)

It was a very hot day of 100 degrees, but my makeup lasted all night with no smudges, running, or creasing! I chose the option to do a bridal trial beforehand, which I highly recommend. I was able to see what I liked and what I didn't like so there were no surprises on the big day. I also chose the option to get a full-size lip gloss and powder to reapply when I needed it. Jasmine is also one of the sweetest people I have ever met, so it was so fun to work with her. Kate did my hair on my wedding day and it looked amazing! She used products that helped my hair hold a curl and keep all the flyaway hairs controlled. I also used clip in extensions, and she did a great job putting them in because I felt no tugging or pulling at all. Both Kate and Jasmine got my bridal party ready, and we all felt so beautiful.

Hi, and thank you for stopping by! I specialize in creating soft, glowy bridal makeup that highlights your natural beauty and gives you an elegant, radiant look for your special day. My goal is to ensure you feel confident, timeless, and truly yourself as you walk down the aisle. For hairstyling, I focus exclusively on Hollywood waves and soft curls—classic, effortless styles that perfectly complement your bridal vision. Every detail matters to me, and I take pride in making your experience as warm and joyful as it is beautiful. It would be such an honor to be part of your big day. Instagram: xo_blushingbeauty_xo“Leah has done my makeup several times now and from someone who doesn’t often wear makeup, I usually just give her a vague idea of what I want and let her take the reins. She is always attentive and asks me questions along the way to make sure I’m getting what I want. My favorite look so far was on my wedding day! It felt natural for my face/style and held up all day. My bridesmaids all loved their makeup too! I always recommend her to any friends needing their makeup done!”Tiana T., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/1e8f205a-0b4d-46e5-95b7-bd23cf073285?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/makeup-by-leahness)

I have always been passionate about beauty! When clients ask me how long I have been doing this, my answer is: "I have about 14 years of experience doing makeup but 8 years doing makeup professionally". I started off initially doing makeup for friends and family, then family friends + friends of friends. I then got a job working at Sephora where I learned a lot about products and working w/ different skin types/tones, ages and styles of makeup etc for 7 years. In 2018 I decided to assist another bridal MUA and that is where I was introduced to the bridal/wedding world & I have loved it since!

Her work is beautiful and she and was so easy to work with. I'm so glad I did a trial so we could nail down the look for my wedding day and she was able to replicate it with any and all feedback I provided/changes we thought of after the trial. I wanted to go soft glam but still wanted it to look very natural, and she was able to create a beautiful balance and bring my dream look to life. My entire party was so happy with their makeup and it lasted beautifully throughout the entire day (and night).”Audrey, a month ago![](https://images.zola.com/c1e1b8f7-f8d8-4372-8712-ae5d005b5083?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/makeup-by-danica-roe)

April May Hair - Bridal Hairstyling Specialist 5.0

  * Starts at $500 
  * Serves Santa Rosa, CA

I'm new to Zola, but not to Bridal Hair! With 17 years dedicated to crafting beautiful hair, and 8 of those in Bridal styling. My experience aids to specializing in varying styles - from vintage, to boho, to a modern esthetic. Recently, my partner and I made the exciting move to Portland from San Francisco. I can’t wait to discover all the stunning wedding venues the PNW has to offer! When I'm not doing hair, you can find me trying a new coffee shop, making kombucha, or hiking with my husband and our dog, Livia. I look forward to the opportunity to work with you!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“I hired April for my wedding day and I could not be happier with the entire process. She was super responsive and got my trial booked with very short notice. The day of the wedding I completely changed the style I wanted and she was so accommodating and did such an amazing job. She did all my bridesmaids as well and everyone looked perfect. She is the best!!!”Marissa K., 9 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/a0c1860c-fbbd-4c08-9270-fb0f5102c991?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/april-may-hair)

Professional Hair and Makeup Services for Bridal, Beauty, Editorial, Fashion, Photoshoots, Ads, Television and Media and Special Occasions. Since I began my career in makeup artistry, I have honed my skills and knowledge to provide the best possible services to my clients.

Whether it's for editorial shoots, bridal looks, or avant-garde creations, I draw from a rich tapestry of global inspirations to craft makeup designs that resonate on a personal level.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“I had the privilege of having the MakeYourselfUp team led by the amazing professional makeup and hair artist Annaliza for my wedding, and I couldn't be happier with the experience. From start to finish, Annaliza's professionalism and leadership stood out. She coordinated everything with such ease, ensuring that every detail was perfect, and her entire team mirrored her dedication and passion for their craft. Annaliza herself is an incredibly talented artist, but what makes her truly exceptional is her ability to lead her team with confidence and grace. She made sure that not only was my makeup and hair flawless, but that my entire bridal party was stunning and ready on time. Her attention to detail, calm demeanor, and ability to manage the morning's schedule helped everything run so smoothly. The makeup she did for me was impeccable—exactly what I envisioned—and it lasted beautifully all day and night. My hair was styled to perfection, and even through all the emotions, dancing, and celebrating, it stayed in place without a hitch. I felt absolutely radiant, and I have Annaliza and her team to thank for that. What truly sets Annaliza apart is her warm, reassuring energy. She made me feel calm and confident on what could have been a stressful day. If you're looking for a team that combines talent, professionalism, and leadership, MakeYourselfUp with Annaliza at the helm is the one to choose. Thank you so much, Annaliza, for making me feel like the most beautiful version of myself on my wedding day!”Jo G., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/340ac323-edb6-46f3-8373-970c044e2a97?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/makeyourselfup)
