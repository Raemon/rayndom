Nataly Lopez Artistry 4.8

  * Team of 4
  * Starts at $250 
  * Serves Tiburon, CA

Welcome, and congratulations on your engagement! I’m Natalie Lopez, a hair and makeup artist with over 10 years of experience. Over the years, I’ve refined my craft, but what hasn’t changed is the joy and excitement I feel for every wedding and special event. I’m deeply passionate about my work, and my mission is to help each client not only look beautiful but also feel radiant and confident by enhancing their natural beauty. I love celebrating love in all its forms, and every client receives my full, undivided attention to ensure their experience feels as special as their day!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“I absolutely loved my experience with Nataly! Prior to booking she was responsive and had reasonable pricing, and when it came to the day off she arrived right on time. I had sent her a few inspiration pictures of how I wanted my hair and makeup and she completely nailed it! I absolutely loved my look and felt so beautiful and confident. I'm also really impressed at how long lasting the hair and makeup was, as we did a photoshoot in foggy conditions and then a whole evening of events, with no need for any touch up. Highly recommend!”Meg G., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/c7d70936-4621-4962-9f47-dae40c34e21f?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/nataly-lopez-artistry)

Welcome. “When you look beautiful you feel beautiful, and it’s creating that kind of happiness that is magical to me.” Enhancing natural beauty is foremost in my mind when I work. I am a makeup artist with over 15 years of experience in the areas of fashion shows, television, music videos, weddings, and special events. My vast experience has helped me blossom into an artist who can help each client transform into their most fierce self. I empower every single client I work with and it’s truly what makes me love my job as an artist.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Makeup by Masara was an absolute dream to work with for my wedding day. From the very first conversation, their communication style was transparent and kind, putting me at ease throughout the entire process. The quality of their work was truly above and beyond - they made me feel beautiful without the makeup feeling "caked on." The look was very natural but still noticeable, which was exactly what I was going for. Masara is phenomenal at what she does and is perfect for brides who don't wear a lot of makeup day-to-day. I was thrilled with the final result and have already referred Makeup by Masara to my 2025 bride friends!”Gabriella G., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/6b6ef2b6-4af7-4063-afc8-a4edf2475284?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/makeup-by-masara)

Beauty stems from the inside and that’s where we start with our babes. We want our couples to feel like an elevated version of themselves. We are all about complimenting the mood and aesthetic of your wedding weekend while coming up with a custom look that brings it all together. With the mama wolf, Ash having over a decade of editorial and fashion experience, our work is more fashion-forward than “bridal”. Highlighting natural beauty above all. Because we work so closely with our photographers, we know how to help you feel photo ready while still feeling “approachable”. We are stoked to be considered for your beauty needs!“I hired Love Wolves Co for my hair and make up and had the best experience with them! Karen was my stylist and she did such an amazing job both for my engagement shoot and wedding day! As someone who never wears more than some mascara, she really allowed me to still feel natural and like myself while highlighting my features and ensuring my make up would photograph well. In fact, she did such a great job with make up for me and my bridesmaids that my step-mom (who typically hates getting her make up done) added that service day of! Knowing that my fine hair doesn’t hold well, I had Karen stay for a touch up right before my ceremony and couldn’t recommend that enough! Everyone loved working with her!”Anais P., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/love-wolves-co-beauty)

From the very first interaction, to our makeup trial, to the wedding morning and even after, Melissa was friendly, flexible, and clearly very knowledgeable about her craft. After our trial, she recommended some afforadble skincare that would help me look my best. Melissa created a detailed makeup timeline that kept us on track and moving smoothly throughout the morning, which was such a relief and took so much stress off of my plate! Melissa's work was truly beautiful, professional, and efficient - she made my bridesmaids, mom, and I look and feel our absolute best (not even to mention that our makeup stayed on the ENTIRE night through tears, sweat, and lots of dancing!) Getting ready with Melissa was an absolute dream, as she was so kind and so fun to be around! I highly recommend Melissa to ANY couple looking for a top-notch beauty team for their wedding day!”Becky M., 8 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/da0a28a4-e057-4137-ab8a-cd03a54335af?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/melissa-oliveira-artistry)

I had zero issues working with them. I don't mean that in a way where there were small things I didn't like but looked over-NO. I truly had zero issues with both of them or any of the people on their team for the day of hair and make up services. Before my big day, I booked two separate hair and make up trials where I asked for completely different things and at either trials they both arrived on time and did exactly the look I asked for. Then, the WEEKEND OF my wedding I realized I couldn't exactly pick between the two different looks and I humbly asked if Josiah could somehow combine the two looks from my trials for a "soft glam" look and he delivered. I have never felt so pretty. Same exact situation with my hair. Josiah and Paige were so patient and friendly and kind! There team worked quickly and efficiently on the day of my wedding to do hair and make up for most of my bridal party plus my mother and my mother in law- and a surprise person who changed her mind from doing her own make up to asking for it done! We even got little personalized touch up kits to reapply any lipstick or pin up any additional hair. I highly highly recommend this team of amazing professionals. I never leave review s for anything but they all should be recognized for their dedicated work. Thank you forever to this team, specifically Josiah and Paige who helped me look and feel so beautiful on my special day.”Jessica S., 7 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/026d2490-e064-44d8-a26a-2028392374dd?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/awaken-beauty)

Hi, and thank you for stopping by! I specialize in creating soft, glowy bridal makeup that highlights your natural beauty and gives you an elegant, radiant look for your special day. My goal is to ensure you feel confident, timeless, and truly yourself as you walk down the aisle. For hairstyling, I focus exclusively on Hollywood waves and soft curls—classic, effortless styles that perfectly complement your bridal vision. Every detail matters to me, and I take pride in making your experience as warm and joyful as it is beautiful. It would be such an honor to be part of your big day. Instagram: xo_blushingbeauty_xo“Leah has done my makeup several times now and from someone who doesn’t often wear makeup, I usually just give her a vague idea of what I want and let her take the reins. She is always attentive and asks me questions along the way to make sure I’m getting what I want. My favorite look so far was on my wedding day! It felt natural for my face/style and held up all day. My bridesmaids all loved their makeup too! I always recommend her to any friends needing their makeup done!”Tiana T., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/1e8f205a-0b4d-46e5-95b7-bd23cf073285?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/makeup-by-leahness)

I have always been passionate about beauty! When clients ask me how long I have been doing this, my answer is: "I have about 14 years of experience doing makeup but 8 years doing makeup professionally". I started off initially doing makeup for friends and family, then family friends + friends of friends. I then got a job working at Sephora where I learned a lot about products and working w/ different skin types/tones, ages and styles of makeup etc for 7 years. In 2018 I decided to assist another bridal MUA and that is where I was introduced to the bridal/wedding world & I have loved it since!

Mitasha did an amazing job with my makeup - it lasted all night, photographed beautifully, and most importantly, she truly listened during my trial and thoughtfully refined the look based on my preferences to ensure it was perfectly tailored to my face and comfort level on the wedding day. She made me feel so confident and cared for, and even surprised me with the cutest makeup aftercare kit, which was such a thoughtful touch. Sush was just as wonderful with my hair. She took the time to understand my vision and worked with me to create the perfect hairstyle that complemented my face shape and truly felt like me. My hair had volume and the most gorgeous curls that held perfectly all night - through dancing, photos, and everything in between. Mitasha and her team made getting ready such a stress-free and fun experience. They kept everyone on schedule, managed timelines seamlessly, and made sure the entire bridal party felt taken care of. They even graciously squeezed my aunt in last minute on the day of the wedding without missing a beat. They kicked off the day on such a calm, positive note, and I couldn’t have asked for a better team.

Whether preparing for an intimate elopement or a multi-day celebration, Raven and her artists bring an editorial eye and a deep respect for the moment, creating looks that are modern, timeless, and unmistakably you.“Raven really made my wedding morning an exceptional one. I’m so glad her and her team were there to set the tone for the day. They arrived early and scheduled enough cushion time to work at a relaxed pace but we still finished early! We all looked amazing– flawless and glamorous, but still like ourselves. Ravens was a pleasure to work with as a whole. From our first phone call, I knew we were a good fit. Her personality is so bubbly and fun but she somehow brought such a calm to the room on my wedding day. Her rates are higher than what I was seeing while searching for a makeup artist but her rates are well worth the cost and are really a reflection of her quality of service. After hiring, I completely understood why her services were prices the way they were and I’m happy I made the investment. I would hire Raven again in a heartbeat and if you’re hesitant to book, DON’T BE. Book her now because she gets booked very quickly.”Reanna, 5 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/raven-reed-luxury-bridal-beauty)

I'm new to Zola, but not to Bridal Hair! With 17 years dedicated to crafting beautiful hair, and 8 of those in Bridal styling. My experience aids to specializing in varying styles - from vintage, to boho, to a modern esthetic. Recently, my partner and I made the exciting move to Portland from San Francisco. I can’t wait to discover all the stunning wedding venues the PNW has to offer! When I'm not doing hair, you can find me trying a new coffee shop, making kombucha, or hiking with my husband and our dog, Livia. I look forward to the opportunity to work with you!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“How lucky was I to have found April for my special day! I got in touch with April through a referral from a friend who had nothing but good things to say about their experience. My initial consult made me feel more at ease and helped me decide what look to go with since it can be overwhelming! I also opted to see April to get my hair cut and colored right before the wedding, and felt confident and pretty, and enjoyed getting to visit and chat with April before the main event. On my wedding day she did hair for my three bridesmaids as well before styling me. They all had a great experience and looked amazing! April executed my romantic vision, and even added in some flowers to match my bouquet. I loved how it turned out, and my hair stayed up and secure all day and night. I loved working with April for my special day, but I love even more that we remained friends! She is fun, funny, creative, and brings a calming energy. She also continues to do my cuts and colors.

MakeYourselfUp 5.0

  * Team of 5
  * Starts at $500 
  * Serves Tiburon, CA

Professional Hair and Makeup Services for Bridal, Beauty, Editorial, Fashion, Photoshoots, Ads, Television and Media and Special Occasions. Since I began my career in makeup artistry, I have honed my skills and knowledge to provide the best possible services to my clients. As a veteran makeup artist, I take the time to understand each client's needs and preferences, providing individualized makeup recommendations that cater to their unique features and styles. Whether it's for editorial shoots, bridal looks, or avant-garde creations, I draw from a rich tapestry of global inspirations to craft makeup designs that resonate on a personal level.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Working with Annaliza and the MakeYourselfUp team was an exceptional experience! Annaliza's talent shines through in her makeup and hair artistry, especially on my wedding day. I was beyond thrilled with the results, and the entire process was seamless and enjoyable. Not only did Annaliza work her magic on me, but she also beautified my maid of honor, and her team did eight bridesmaids, including my mom. The transformation was incredible—my mom looked absolutely radiant and years younger! What truly stood out about working with Annaliza was the ease of collaboration. I shared my preferred style and showed her some inspiration from Pinterest, and she immediately understood my vision. Her expertise went beyond just executing my ideas; she also made insightful suggestions that enhanced my overall look in ways I hadn’t considered, making the process enjoyable and stress-free. One aspect that truly impressed me was the team’s punctuality. Annaliza and her team arrived 30 minutes early, ensuring we had more than enough time for everyone’s makeup and hair. This level of dedication and attention to detail not only reassured me but also made a significant difference on such an important day. I am incredibly grateful to Annaliza and the MakeYourselfUp team for their exceptional work and for making my wedding day even more memorable!”Joana, a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/55684471-aca5-4f1e-b9d1-e5384cd4a6bd?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/makeyourselfup)
