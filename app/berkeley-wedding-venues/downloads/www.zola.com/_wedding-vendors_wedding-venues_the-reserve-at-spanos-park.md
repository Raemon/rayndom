  * ### Engagement Party

•Verified review

•Rachelle C.•May 30, 2025

The Reserve at Spanos Park was the perfect venue for our engagement party. Which was held on the Clubhouse patio. From the moment we first met with the staff, they were incredibly personable, outgoing, and kind. Rebecca, the wedding coordinator, was very attentive to our needs and made sure every detail was taken care of. The venue itself was absolutely beautiful and gorgeous, creating an intimate setting for our special day. The staff set up and broke down everything seamlessly, and the food was amazing. We're so grateful to the team at The Reserve at Spanos Park for helping to make our engagement party truly unforgettable.
