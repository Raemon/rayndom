  * ### "A Dream Wedding at Leonard Lake Reserve"

•Verified review

•Michelle•Aug 16, 2024

We had our wedding at Leonard Lake Reserve, and it was everything we could have hoped for. The venue is tucked away in this beautiful, remote spot, with a gorgeous lake that made for the most incredible backdrop. The staff were beyond kind and attentive, taking care of every little detail so we could just enjoy the day. If you're looking for a place that feels intimate and naturally stunning, Leonard Lake Reserve is truly the perfect spot.
