  * ### Phenomenal Officiant

•Verified review

•Kevin Malesic R.•Oct 26, 2025

We hired Pamela to officiate our October wedding in Massachusetts after searching online for LGBTQ-friendly officiants, and she was absolutely amazing! From our very first meeting, we knew we had made the right choice. She was professional, experienced, reassuring, personable, and so easy to work with throughout the entire process. Pamela took the time to get to know us and crafted a ceremony that felt deeply personal and true to our love story, which was so special. Several of our guests commented on how captivating the ceremony was and were surprised to learn that we hadn’t known Pamela beforehand. She also guided us through the marriage license process and made it very easy and stress-free. We would highly recommend her to any engaged couple looking for a thoughtful, inclusive, and exceptional officiant. Thank you, Pamela!
