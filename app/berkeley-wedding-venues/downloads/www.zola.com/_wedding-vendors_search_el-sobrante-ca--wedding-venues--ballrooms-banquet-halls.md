![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“San Ramon Waters By Wedgewood Weddings was a stunning venue for our wedding, but we did experience some minor communication issues that caused a bit of stress at the start of the day. The space itself was truly breathtaking, with its amazing new upgrades and beautiful views. However, there were a few details that weren't properly communicated to us, which led to a bit of a rocky start. Although my bridal party and I had lots to deal with prior to ceremony start, these issues were not something our guests would have seen/noticed. To their credit, the Wedgewood team acknowledged their mistakes and upgraded our bar package to make up for it. Overall, the venue was beautiful and the staff did their best to ensure our day went smoothly, despite the initial hiccups. We would recommend San Ramon Waters to other couples looking for a gorgeous wedding location.”Gabriella G., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/09e08c08-a991-4f46-8f27-5f0c08b2944c?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/san-ramon-by-wedgewood-weddings)

“My wife and I had an unforgettable wedding reception! The food was amazing, the ballroom was beautiful, and the service was top notch. Amy is a kind soul that help my wife and I put our wedding together in the beggining and was very professional when we needed her help. Jessica, our wedding coordinator, helped us with the final touches we needed following up to our wedding day! We picked the orange blossom package which was affordable and what we thought our guest would enjoy, which they did 100%!

![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Our wedding day at Marinaj was an absolute dream come true. From the moment we met with Brian, the sales manager, to discuss our vision, we knew we were in capable hands. The ceremony on the veranda was flawless, thanks to Brian’s meticulous planning and execution. Jenny, the brilliant mind behind the menu, guided us through delectable options. We opted for the chicken and waffles and salmon bites, which were a hit during our endless tray-passed hors d’oeuvres-filled cocktail hour. The bartender duo Lee & Natasha kept the drinks flowing, delighting our guests throughout the night. Daniel, the event manager, ensured our chosen lighting and timeline ran seamlessly. Walking into our beautifully decorated venue(Royal Ballroom) was a literal breath-taker, and our guests shared the same ‘wow’ reaction. The chandeliers just give the room the most elegant touch. The entire staff, elegantly dressed, served with precision. The speed at which everyone was served was impressive. The highlight, undoubtedly, was the incredible food—Parmesan crusted Caesar salad, braised short rib, and chicken Marsala left our guests raving. Marinaj made our wedding day the best of our lives. Brian, Daniel, Jenny, and the entire staff went above and beyond. Look no further for the best wedding venue in SoCal. Thank you, Marinaj, for an unforgettable day!”Stephanie & C., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/marinaj-banquets-events)

“The Venue Inland Empire was a fantastic choice for our wedding of 75 guests. Their communication throughout the planning process was clear, concise and friendly, which made everything run smoothly. The space itself is cozy and the perfect size for our medium-sized celebration, though we did wish there was a dedicated bridal room. Despite that minor detail, the venue's clear signage and ability to host both our wedding ceremony and reception made it an ideal location. If you're looking for a local spot for a wedding of around 75 people, I highly recommend checking out The Venue Inland Empire.”Michelle, 7 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/22b876b1-deb9-48be-b056-0423336a5609?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-venue-inland-empire)

The space itself is truly theatrical and glamorous, with an old Hollywood feel that was perfect for our vision. Richard and his team went above and beyond to bring our dream to life, even being flexible with set-up time to ensure everything was just right.

“My dream wedding included walking down the aisle to the man that I loved. Found the dream man, just needed the dream place. My goal was to find a place that had character in itself. The Chapel of Orange was everything that I imagined. I visited a coupled more places, but the Chapel of Orange stayed in my heart. It was the right decision. The Chapel has a magical blend of classical charm and whimsical beauty that created the perfect atmosphere for our special day. Melissa was amazing throughout the planning process, and she, Cheryl, and the entire team worked tirelessly to bring our vision to life.

They made everything really easy and were really communicative throughout the process. The package we got came with most items - we decided to go with our own photographer instead of the one they recommended. We also got a videographer, a dance floor, and backdrop. Other than that the price we paid included the venue, food, DJ, all the set up and clean up (tables chairs, etc.), cake and table florals. (I did need to purchase my own bridal and bridesmaid florals). Mostly everything went as planned and everyone had a fun time! It was a beautiful venue and everyone really appreciated being able to go sit outdoors to have a drink.”Diana C., 3 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/aliso-viejo-by-wedgewood-weddings)

“Our wedding at Summit House Restaurant was an absolute dream come true. From the very first interaction, the team there was transparent, professional, and clearly knew exactly what they were doing. The natural beauty of the venue lent itself to so many unforgettable moments and photos that we'll cherish forever. The Summit House team, from planning and ceremony coordination with LeeAnn, to the entire service team during cocktail hour and reception, ensured everything was seamless. They made sure we were well-informed and had everything we needed, and we loved that we were able to secure our own vendors while also using a couple from their preferred list. The gorgeous landscaping, accessible location, great food and service, and affordable pricing made Summit House the perfect choice for our special day. We couldn't recommend them more highly and would get married there all over again if we could!”Amanda L., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/9bd3e8c4-14b7-4908-9d1d-4d34e923b69b?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/summit-house-restaurant)

## About wedding venues in El Sobrante, CA

### 

California offers an incredible 840 miles of coastline, 3,000+ wineries and ancient redwoods for your wedding day. When you choose the Golden State, you're getting exceptional natural lighting for your ceremony across diverse settings from Mediterranean coastal zones to alpine mountain backdrops. Each region has its own distinctive character that can perfectly match your vision.

### What Makes California Wedding Venues So Special?

Northern California's Napa Valley welcomes you with rolling vineyards and Spanish colonial architecture where intimate wine cave ceremonies create unforgettable moments. Head to Southern California and you'll find oceanfront venues like Duke's Malibu where you can exchange vows with the Pacific stretching out behind you while enjoying fresh coastal-inspired cuisine. Palm Springs offers dramatic desert venues with mountain backdrops and striking midcentury modern architecture that photographs beautifully.

### How Much Do Wedding Venues in California Cost?

Wedding venues in California typically run between $9,600 and $11,700 which aligns nicely with the national range of $6,500-$12,000. This represents about 18% of your total wedding budget. Your overall costs will vary based on guest count:

  * 50 guests: $26,190
  * 100 guests: $43,692
  * 150 guests: $60,141
  * 200 guests: $74,836
  * 250 guests: $89,530

Accessibility options have improved greatly across California venues in recent years.

### When Should You Book Your California Wedding Venue?

October leads venue inquiries in California with couples typically booking venues about 13 months (400 days) before their wedding date. If you're dreaming of a Northern California wine country wedding during peak season you'll want to book up to 18 months in advance. Southern California venues offer more flexibility especially during winter months when you can still enjoy beautiful weather while potentially securing better rates.
