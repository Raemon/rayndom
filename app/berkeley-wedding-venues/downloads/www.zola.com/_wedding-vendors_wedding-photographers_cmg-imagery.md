Hi, I'm Carrie the lady behind the lens of CMG Imagery. I'm a photographer with twelve years wedding experience and a focus on natural light and storytelling. In my work, I am inspired to capture love and connection in a timeless and authentic way that will be cherished for years to come. I love creating images with movement that capture the heart and soul, the candid moments, the playfulness and personality. So get ready to adventure and let's tell your story!

How do I photograph weddings you may ask! The most common question I am asked is, "Can you make us look good even if we are awkward in front of a camera"? The answer is YES! I 100% understand how that feels and I will guide you through posing prompts that will allow us to get those authentic, candid style shots. Let's have fun with it!

  * ### Carried is great! Beautiful photos! 

•Verified review

•Wilson•Jun 12, 2025

Carrie is a wonderful photographer and person! We booked her to take our engagement and wedding photos and we were very happy with the results. Neither of us love getting our photo taken but she made the whole process easy and comfortable. She recommend a bunch of beautiful locations for our engagement shoot that were in our area and worked around our schedule. Our wedding photos were great (even got some with us and our dogs) and she got lots of amazing shots of our guests enjoying themselves. We highly recommend booking Carrie for your special day! Professional, efficient, and a wizard behind the lens. Thanks, Carrie \- W&J

  * ### Hire CMG!

•Verified review

•Natasha Lozanoff Photo•Jun 11, 2024

Carrie is an absolutely amazing wedding photographer!! She has such a spectacular eye and is so amazing at putting people at ease. I cannot recommend her enough for weddings, events, and portraits. She has such an amazing way of telling a story from start to finish with weddings. Her use of light is superb and she is excellent at helping pose couples as well as making them feel comfortable.

  * ### Beautiful Engagement Photos 

•Verified review

•Taylor and D.•Jul 13, 2023

Working with Carrie was an incredible experience. My fiancé and I hired her to take our engagement pictures and they are better than I could have imagined - so good that we've also hired her to do our wedding in October! Carrie's eye for detail and her ability to capture the essence of every moment transformed ordinary scenes (our backyard, In n Out, and our favorite dive bar to name a few!) into life-long memories. I think what truly sets her apart is her ability to establish a genuine connection with her clients. Throughout the shoot, Carrie made me feel at ease, enabling both of us to express ourselves naturally, resulting in photographs that truly reflected our personalities and captured the perfect moments. I highly recommend this photographer to anyone seeking not only exceptional photographs but also a truly enjoyable and memorable experience.

  * ### Great Experience With Engagement and Wedding

•Verified review

•David and J.•Mar 20, 2022

We hired Carrie as our wedding photographer, and also have done an engagement photo session with her. We're both somewhat camera shy, and didn't know quite what to expect with a photo session, but we had a wonderful time with Carrie and enjoyed the whole experience immensely. She has been fast to respond and stay in touch, and we just got our engagement photos today. Among the comments we've already received are "wow, those are the most beautiful engagement photos I've ever seen!" What initially attracted us to Carrie was the excitement and enthusiasm she had from when we first met, and she's maintained that same attitude through every interaction we've had with her. We enjoyed working with Carrie for both our engagement session at a regional park as well as our wedding photos at an old church and rose garden. She took indoor and outdoor pictures well, and captured fun moments and interesting angles that highlighted the locations we chose well.

## Frequently asked questions

5 Answers

Ask them a question

### How do you photograph weddings?

The most common question I am asked is, "Can you make us look good even if we are awkward in front of a camera"? The answer is YES! I 100% understand how that feels and I will guide you through poses that will allow us to get those authentic, candid shots. I love giving direction so clients look and feel their best and can relax and enjoy the day.

### Where are you based and do you travel?

I''m based in Berkeley, CA and yes I love to travel! If you want me to photograph your story, it may require a travel fee, depending on where it takes place. I love being inspired by shooting in new places, so feel free to start a conversation about your destination wedding and let's get some amazing and unique shots of you and your person!

### When will we get our photos?

Your will receive an online gallery link with your photos within maximum 8 weeks (sometimes less depending on the season I photograph your wedding). After this, you will be able to select your images from the online gallery to purchase separately as prints or an album. You will also receive a USB of the carefully selected and lightly edited images saved as jpegs.

### How many pictures will we receive?

For full day weddings, you will receive 800+ depending on the package you select. I am a firm believer in quality over quantity and all galleries are carefully curated to include the best images throughout the day. You can expect to receive a gallery that tells the full story of your wedding day without including duplicates.

### What should I expect when booking a session?

After a conversation about your goals for the session, I will send over a contract to be signed. A fifty percent deposit is required to reserve your session date. Once I receive your contract and deposit, your session is booked. After this, I will work with you to create a photo itinerary within your wedding day to insure we get all of the most important shots to you.
