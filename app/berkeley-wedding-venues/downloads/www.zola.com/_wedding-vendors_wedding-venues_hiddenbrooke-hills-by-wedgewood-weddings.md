•Verified review

•Karina A.•Mar 20, 2025

Hiddenbrooke Hills is a phenomenal venue. What sold us on them initially was they provided a binder with every detail we could ever think of -- food, cake, florals, timeline (planning and day of), down to whether or not you wanted your pet in the wedding. They have a number of recommended/partnered vendors, but aside from linens and tables, catering, and bartender, you could opt in or out of any vendors you wanted to fully customize your day. And the catering and bartenders were excellent, and they have some excellent options for chairs, tables, and linens -- so don't let this deter you! They were incredible communicators and reassured us every step of the way. The entire team really went above and beyond. Our day-of coordinator Christina was friendly, organized, gave us space when we needed but kept us to our timeline, and really made us feel like guests at our own wedding in the best way possible. Our banquet captain Eric went out of his way to ensure that us as well as our immediate families were treated like royalty the entire night, and we truly felt like honored guests on our own wedding day. The venue itself is very romantic. The outdoor ceremony site feels private and the aisle and archway is actually paved for the bridal party -- a game-changer for anyone wearing heels! We opted to do an indoor ceremony due to the weather, and the indoor ceremony site feels just as well thought out and romantic as the outdoor option. It felt like a log cabin surrounded by greenery. The entire walkway from indoor ceremony site to cocktail hour location to reception is covered. The cocktail hour location is a cute fireside area with enormous windows and exposed stonework. It feels cozy and was a perfect space for our guests. It also is adjacent to our reception area, which was perfect if our guests wanted a quieter place to chat during open dancing. The reception area is super romantic with white drapery and enormous windows, with doors that can be propped open for crossflow and a quiet HVAC system to keep everyone comfortable. Of all the venues we looked at, we felt like we got the best deal for the price here. It was simple to create a custom wedding without feeling "railroaded", but still have enough options to feel guided instead of lost. Everything -- from the partnered vendors, to the site, to the staff -- felt like it was a luxury experience. Definitely check out Hiddenbrooke -- you won't be disappointed!

The service and venue were amazing. Was the easiest wedding planning one could ask for especially in the short time frame we had.

Hiddenbrooke Hills was a gorgeous venue and the team at Wedgewood Weddings made our day absolutely memorable! I really wanted something that felt like a garden wedding and this place definitely delivered. We had a gorgeous garden ceremony but we were through the moon about the pavilion, it looked so elegant! The entire day was so fun and easy with the help of my Wedgewood Weddings coordinator and banquet captain who made sure my husband and I were taken care of the entire day. If there were issues, I wasn't aware because they were so on top of taking care of everything. Thank you so much Wedgewood Weddings for making our wedding day amazing!
