I’ve been photographing weddings for five years, mostly on film. My background in art, landscape architecture, and graphic design shapes how I approach photographing weddings, from light and composition to the details that make each wedding unique. For me, wedding photography is about being present and noticing fleeting, meaningful, and joyful moments as well as the elements that give your day its character. I move through the day with curiosity, joy, and care, letting it unfold naturally so the images feel soulful, expressive, and alive.

I approach each wedding day as if I’m a guest with a bunch of cameras - when someone asks me how I know you two, that means I am doing my job correctly. I like to make friends with your people so that I can witness all the moments. Also it’s more fun for everyone that way.

  * ### Amanda is the best!

•Verified review

•Joan•Oct 24, 2025

We absolutely loved working with Amanda! From the start, she was so easy to communicate with — relaxed, responsive, and genuinely fun to be around. On the day of the wedding, she managed to capture the sweetest and silliest moments without ever making it feel like we were in the middle of a photo shoot. We loved that she shot a mix of film and digital and the photos are absolutely beautiful. Beyond her incredible talent, she’s just an awesome person, and we honestly loved getting to hang out with her throughout the day. We couldn’t recommend her more highly!

  * ### The perfect wedding photographer for us

•Verified review

•Katie & K.•Oct 23, 2025

Amanda is an incredible artist, and exactly the type of person you want to photograph for your wedding if you want it to be easy and authentic. Upfront in working with her, she told us “your wedding is not a photoshoot,” and we knew she was the one for us. She made us laugh and captured all our special moments and people beautifully, and we ended up with a collection of stunning photos that you can truly feel and that will help us remember our wedding day forever. We’d recommend her to anyone looking for beauty, simplicity, and authenticity in their wedding photography experience.

  * ### Best Photographer Ever

•Verified review

•Chelsea•Oct 22, 2025

From the moment we first spoke with Amanda, her relaxed, funny, and warm personality instantly put us at ease. She is the perfect blend of professional and personable - Amanda fit right in with our friends and family on the wedding day, and somehow was everywhere at once to capture all the little moments we didn't even get to see. She is pure magic when it comes to capturing candid moments. The photos she delivered are truly artful, timeless, and beautifully document our special day. We couldn't be happier with our wedding photos, and highly recommend Amanda to any couple looking for a talented, personable wedding photographer who uses film as a main tool of documentation.

## Frequently asked questions

7 Answers

Ask them a question

### Will you edit all our pictures?

Definitely. All final images will be edited for color, saturation, exposure, and sharpness to ensure they look beautiful. Even the film scans are slightly tweaked so that they are gorgeous and coherent within your gallery.

### Do you have insurance?

I do! Just let me know if your venue requires a certificate of liability, and I’ll send that over to them.

### What’s your back-up plan if you can’t photograph our wedding as planned?

In my entire experience as a wedding photographer, I’ve never cancelled a booking. In the very rare event that I’m unable to photograph your wedding, I’ll make sure you’re covered by one of my extremely talented peers or a contracted assistant. I would also provide you with a wider list of photographers from the many film wedding photographer networking groups I’m in, so you can find the perfect replacement.

### Do you also offer video services?

No, I prefer focusing on photography only, so you can get the best wedding pictures possible.

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically, couples book me about 6-12 months before their wedding date. But I really do love the last-minute events to be honest. That being said, you should book me sooner rather than later. But if it is last-minute, please reach out anyway!!

### Do you work with assistants or other photographers?

Sometimes. If you know for sure you want another photographer we can add it right into your package when I create your custom proposal.

### How much film do you shoot? Can you do all film??

The amount of film I shoot on a wedding day varies A LOT depending on the light. I use film when I am inspired to use it. But I can definitely do 100% film all day, I have done it before and I loved it so much. We can chat about this if you're interested.
