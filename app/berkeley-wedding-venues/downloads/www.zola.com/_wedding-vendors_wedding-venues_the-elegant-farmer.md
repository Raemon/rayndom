The owners of The Elegant Farmer were so easy to work with, and we really felt like they were excited to make the event special. The stunning garden setting needed little additional decor, creating a beautiful and relaxed atmosphere. The staff were friendly and attentive, keeping everything running smoothly and on time. The food was not only beautiful, but delicious as well! A highlight was the bride and groom's magical send-off down the garden path, the perfect end to an amazing night.

I had the absolute pleasure to photograph a wedding styled shoot for The Elegant Farmer. The space is absolutely breathtaking, every space is intimate but inviting. So romantic for a date night or a space to get married! If you’re looking for an amazing location for any type of celebration, please come and see this space! Lynn is quick to respond to any questions you may have, very attentive to details and her love for the business and guest shine through!

  * ### This place is Awesome!

•Verified review

•Chris S.•Mar 20, 2025

I was fortunate to attend the Grand Opening of the The Elegant Farmer. Nestled in the heart of Chester, California, Owners Lynn Wimer and Cowboy Joe have created a Premier Wedding Venue that seamlessly combines rustic charm with modern elegance. I was impressed by the breathtaking mountain views, lush gardens, and a charming courtyard, creating an idyllic backdrop for Weddings and all types of events. The Food and Drink? Wow! The culinary offerings were excellent and presented beautifully. They also have an excellent wine selection. I also enjoyed some shopping in their boutique store offering a curated selection of home, kitchen, and garden décor. I feel that the Elegant Farmer stands out as a top choice for couples seeking a venue that combines natural beauty with exceptional service. Check it out! You will not be disappointed. Chris
