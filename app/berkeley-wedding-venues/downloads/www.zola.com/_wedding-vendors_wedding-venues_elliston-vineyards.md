•Verified review

•Jenella Presley Visuals•Jan 26, 2024

Ellison Vineyards is a photographers and videographers dream. With their stately manor, rolling vineyards, and beautiful flora and fauna, Elliston is a dynamic and stunning venue. As a photographer and videographer I absolutely adore this location, not only because of how it looks, but also because every single person who works at this venue is outstanding. Athena, the lead coordinator, truly cares for the couples and all of the vendors, ensuring that everyone is cared for and having an amazing time. Elliston vineyards is a must see and experience!!
