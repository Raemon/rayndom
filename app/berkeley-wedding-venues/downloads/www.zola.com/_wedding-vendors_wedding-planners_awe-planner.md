As the founder of AWE Planner, you might wonder: How did she become a planner? How many events do we coordinate each year? What inspires us about this work? For founder Jenn Greel, becoming a wedding and event planner was a natural path. Her journey began with bartending private events, and planning gatherings for friends, which eventually spared the idea of launching her own planning business. From our first wedding fair to signing our first client-who happened to be a coworker at the time-AWE Planner was built from scratch. With every event we've learned, grown, and harnessed our experiences to shape the outstanding team we are today.

Each season we coordinate between 30 and 50 weddings. Jenn guides the AWE Team through each event, ensuring seamless communication from clients to the vendors and bringing every detail of the clients vision to life. We love event coordination for so many reasons: the unique stories of our clients, the love that fills each celebration, and the diversity of each experience. We've had the joy of honoring traditions from various cultures including Indian, Chinese, Filipino, and Latin to name just a few. If you are looking for a confidence boost to ensure a smooth, relaxed and unforgettable wedding day, look no further than the AWE Planner Team

**In three words:** Confident, Organized, Supportive

  * ### BEST SF wedding coordinator 

•Verified review

•Diana H.•Dec 21, 2025

My wife and I got married a few months ago and we hired Jenn from Awe Planner for our ceremony. It was at the Palace of Fine Arts in SF. Jenn was super communicative during the planning phase and extremely detail oriented. She came to the rehearsal and was able to see our vision and make sure everyone was on board. She was GREAT with the kids too which was helpful! Wedding day, Jenn was absolutely ON IT and super incredible! She was very professional and knew exactly what to do even when a few things went wrong…. She quickly pivoted and still able to execute flawlessly. I never packed at any point as I knew Jenn had everything under control at all times. Her energy is great- positive and high but not overwhelming at all… literally Perfect! We had several people compliment us on how well she did which is when you know that u hired the right team! Jenn truly made our wedding ceremony run perfectly and we would 200% recommend her and hire her again if we needed! 10/10 hire her! Thank you again, Jenn!!!!

  * ### Best Coordinator Ever!!

•Verified review

•Rachel L.•Aug 27, 2025

Jenn is amazing! We booked her "A Little Bit of Help" package but truly got so much more than advertised. From the start, she helped us stay on track with booking vendors, planning logistics, and did a walk through of our venues to help us create our dream wedding. She also helped us research vendors within our price range (I highly recommend the taqueria she connected us with in the area!). Jenn was available at all times via text and email, which made the planning process feel effortless. She has an extensive inventory of décor items that we were able to borrow, including table signs, centerpiece vases, sign easels, photo frames, a gift card box, and more. On top of that, she is an expert florist who brought our vision to life through stunning church arrangements, bouquets, and centerpieces. On the wedding day, Jenn was calm, level-headed, and quick on her feet. She seamlessly managed our large and lively Asian family during a long photography session and kept everyone happy. She also created a detailed timeline, coordinated with all our vendors, and kept everything running smoothly. Thanks to her, we truly felt like guests at our own wedding -- something we didn't think was possible. If you want a coordinator who is organized, creative, professional, and genuinely invested in making your day perfect, Jenn is the one.

  * ### Exactly what we needed 

•Verified review

•Christie B.•Jul 1, 2025

Jen at AWE is amazing. My husband and I had been together for many years when we finally decided to tie the knot because we were going to have a baby! So we decided to have a baby shower-wedding combo event. It was ambitious. We wanted to have the event at our home and Jen helped us figure out how to transform our space into the perfect setting for about 100 people—in the middle of winter, no less! Jen and her team worked seamlessly with my vendors, and had perfect recommendations for the vendors I still needed. The arrangements Jen provided were perfect for our event and more beautiful than I could have imagined. But the best parts of working with Jen were that she has great communication, is reliable, made me feel appreciated as a human, and she made plenty of space for having a sense of humor amidst it all. She also worked and planned carefully to ensure a successful day given all of the family dynamics involved. And, I must say, the whole event turned out beautifully. All of the planning paid off, I’m so glad we got to do it, and incredibly grateful we got to work with Jen to make it happen.

  * ### Great wedding coordinators!

•Verified review

•Alyssa R.•May 15, 2025

We were so happy to find AWE Planner to coordinate our wedding reception. Jenn was very communicative and easy to work with, making sure to check in with us leading up to our wedding and helping wrangle all our vendors. She and her assistant, Flor, even came out for several walkthroughs at our venue to make sure every detail was figured out. The icing on the cake was they were also able to create and deliver our floral arrangements, which was a HUGE bonus. Our flowers looked incredible and worked perfectly with our aesthetic. We were able to hand off all of our signage and decor and they put everything together beautifully. If you are having any sort of wedding or event, I would highly recommend hiring AWE Planner to make your vision come to life.
