NIDE Company (Nictilay Interior Decor & Event Planning Company) was founded on the belief that weddings should feel intentional, beautiful, and stress-free. I’m Nicky, founder and lead designer, and I combine strategic planning with creative design to bring each couple’s vision to life. I focus not only on logistics, but on how your day feels — guiding, advocating, and creating a seamless experience from start to finish. Every wedding is thoughtfully customized and never treated as a template. We don’t decorate — we transform. And it’s an honor to do so for every couple we serve.

What sets NIDE Company apart is our hands-on, collaborative approach. We work closely with our couples, listen carefully to their vision, and lead with intention from start to finish. Whether your wedding is intimate or grand, local or destination, it’s never treated as a template. We never duplicate our work so each event is ALWAYS unique!

**In three words:** Confident, Creative, Honest

I have had the absolute pleasure of working with NIDE Company on several projects, and no other event services have compared! Their owner is efficient, considerate, and kind when it comes to helping both vendors and clients come together for their special occasions. I have provide baking services to her clients from birthdays to baby showers, and NIDE is always at the top of their game.

## Frequently asked questions

7 Answers

Ask them a question

### Do you also plan other events, like showers or rehearsal dinners?

Yes! NIDE Company also plans and designs additional wedding-related events, including bridal showers, engagement parties, rehearsal dinners, welcome events, and post-wedding celebrations. These services can be added to an existing wedding package or booked separately, allowing us to create a cohesive, elevated experience across your entire wedding weekend.

### Do you take on multiple weddings in a day or weekend?

No. NIDE Company intentionally limits the number of weddings we take on to ensure every couple receives our full attention and care. We focus on one wedding per day, and in most cases one wedding per weekend, allowing us to provide hands-on support, thoughtful execution, and a seamless experience from start to finish.

### How much time should we expect to spend with you?

The amount of time spent together depends on the package you select and your specific needs. Our planning process is intentionally structured to be efficient and focused, so you receive expert guidance without unnecessary meetings. Most couples can expect scheduled check-ins at key milestones, ongoing communication as needed, and more hands-on support as your wedding date approaches. Our goal is to be present when it matters most while keeping the process seamless and stress-free for you.

### Are you part of a team? Who will we be working with?

Yes. NIDE Company is supported by a trusted team of well trained staff. You will work directly with me, Nicky, as your lead planner and primary point of contact throughout the planning process. For larger events or on the wedding day, I’m supported by my design assistant Alayla and our other event staff to ensure everything runs smoothly. This team-based approach allows us to deliver attentive, hands-on service while maintaining a seamless experience for our couples.

### It seems expensive to hire a planner. Are we going to be able to afford you?

Yes! The average couple (without a wedding planner) spends over 300 hours planning their wedding. As wedding planners we have already done the homework and have formed relationships with quality vendors. We will direct you to one or two vendors that match your personality as well as your budget. We pride ourselves on working with our clients to make sure their budget is met.

### Will I still have some control over my wedding if I hire you?

Absolutely! We will do as much, or as little, as you want us to do during the wedding planning process. We always ask you what you want and we then make our suggestions to you for final approval.

### How long have you been planning weddings and how did you get to be a wedding planner?

I have been planning events since 2019 and recently became certified as an International Wedding Planner. I used to assist my mother when I was a teenager when she would conduct and decor weddings. Design and fashion have always been my passion and I am very excited to finally do what I love!
