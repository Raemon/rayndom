Hi, I’m Hannah - owner and lead planner at Amaziling Events! I started this business because I truly love helping couples create wedding days that feel like them - meaningful, relaxed, and full of joy. I believe wedding planning should feel like a partnership, not a pressure cooker. With an accountant’s brain and a creative heart, I’m here to handle the logistics, bring your vision to life, and make sure you actually enjoy being engaged (yes, that’s allowed!). If you need full-service planning or just someone to tie it all together in the final stretch, I’m always in your corner.

We’re planners who don’t believe in copy-paste weddings. We get to know you, your vibe, and your non-negotiables. We come with our emergency kits, design spreadsheets (so you don’t have to), and zero negative energy. This is your day, babe. You dream it, we're making it happen. No vendor kickbacks, just real relationships. We want your engagement to feel like love, not a logistics job. Aunt Linda can relax. We’ve got this. Shoot me a message! I’d love to hear what you're dreaming up.

**In three words:** Confident, Flexible, Supportive

  * ### Amazing Planner

•Verified review

•Julia G.•May 5, 2025

As an officiant, I absolutely loved working with Hannah from Amaziling Events! She was organized, creative, and incredibly thoughtful throughout the entire planning process. Highly recommend her to anyone looking for a calm, capable, and truly talented wedding planner!

  * ### Best decision of our wedding!

•Verified review

•Cynthia•May 2, 2025

I honestly don’t know how I would’ve pulled off my wedding without Hannah. My brain is all over the place, but she stepped in and made everything so much easier and kept me calm. She truly made the whole process way less stressful. Even when I bailed out of doing a bunch of my diys at the last minute because I was too overwhelmed, she found the perfect vendors that we could afford to pull off the look I wanted. If you want someone who’s organized, professional, and super easy to work with, Hannah is your person. She made our day beautiful and unforgettable! Thank you, Hannah !

  * ### Incredible!

•Verified review

•Natalie L.•May 2, 2025

Hannah was incredible in every sense of the word. She thought of everything and reminded me of things hadn’t even cross my mind that was so important to my wedding. She was the greatest right hand woman I could ask for. She exceeded all my expectations! I didn’t have to worry while I was getting ready since I knew she was on top of everything. She managed other people very well and got everything ready for the event. It could not have ran smoothly without her help. I highly recommend you choosing Hannah for your wedding. She will make sure everything runs smoothly and calm you down. She’s such a hard worker. Thank you so much Hannah!

## Frequently asked questions

4 Answers

Ask them a question

### Are you part of a team? Who will we be working with?

You will be getting me, Hannah, your Main Planner who is with you and supporting you the entirety of your booking, as well as an assistant planner for your day-of. Our Lead Assistant Planner is the fabulous, experienced, and detail oriented Veronica! If your wedding requires more hands-on-deck we will bring in as many assistants as needed for an extra fee.

### Do you also plan other events, like showers or rehearsal dinners?

Yep! We do Bridal Showers, Engagement Parties, Baby Shower, Graduation Parties and more! Just ask and you shall receive :)

### How much time should we expect to spend with you?

This totally depends on the package you've selected. For Full Service, expect us to become totally entwined in each other's lives. For Month-Of Coordination, you can expect to meet/chat with me three times for about an hour each before your wedding day- Discovery Call, Takeover Meeting, & Rehearsal.

### Do you take on multiple weddings in a day or weekend?

Absolutely not! It's all about you, babe! You get the very best- not the over-tired, stressed-out, and over-worked us. That's how mistakes and oversights happen, and we are not about that for you. We make sure that you are the full priority, no matter which package you choose!
