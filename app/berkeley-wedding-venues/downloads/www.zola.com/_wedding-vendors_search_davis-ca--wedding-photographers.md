Kirstin Bimson Photography 5.0 Davis, CA

  * Photojournalistic style
  * Starts at $1,350 

Based in Davis, CA with 13+ years of photography experience and 100+ weddings photographed, I aim not only to create beautiful images with artistry and collaborative vision, but to capture the heart and soul of my subjects, creating an enjoyable and relaxed atmosphere for genuine expression. I aim to be more than just a camera in the back of the room; I also offer my clients planning advice born of my years of experience, and take proactive measures on the big day to ensure your wedding--and your photos, turn out memorable, beautiful, and stress-free.“Kirsten is a consummate professional and handled the chaos of my wedding day with her steady manner. She is very responsive and accommodating. Her communication is great and in particular she was equipped to deal with a multicultural wedding where half the guests and family didn't speak English! The pictures are gorgeous and the whole experience with Kirsten from initial contact to the final (beautiful) result went smoothly!”Cassandra, 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/kirstin-bimson-photography)

  * Serves Davis, CA

Hey, I'm so glad you're here! My name is Heather and I live in beautiful Foresthill, CA. I love any and all hard seltzers, my Great Dane Fritz, and using my camera to capture all the feels. About my business? Well I'm basically a professional wedding crasher, so you know you will always have fun with me! Oh and I've pretty much cried at every wedding I've ever been to...and yours is no exception. Let's be friends!“You can't go wrong with Heather. She and her team handled our engagement photos and shot our wedding. Both sets of pictures are incredible! She captured amazing moments of our wedding--and they match our memories perfectly. Heather's photos are stunning, but also feel authentic. Beyond her photography and editing abilities, she made us feel very comfortable. My wife and I aren't used to professional photoshoots (we are humble folk), so having someone so kind and down-to-earth made those experiences fun. Heather felt like someone we'd want to have at our wedding anyway! Hire her, have fun, and frame those prints.”Adrian J., 2 years ago![](https://images.zola.com/03391a15-99cf-4829-bd1e-846370130a58?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/heather-blackwood-photography)

  * Classic style

Hi! I’m Azaria. I am a Northern California-based Travel Wedding and Elopement photographer. How did I get here? I grew up in small-town Nebraska with a love for adventure and photography. I got to explore those passions when I got married, my husband joined the military, and we got stationed overseas. I used that opportunity to travel and see many countries. When we returned stateside, I pursued my passion for photography by getting my degree at Brooks Institute of Photography.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“My wife and I highly recommend Azaria Chavira!

I’ve had a camera in my hand since I can remember. On family vacations each of us had a camera and would come back with several rolls of film. It was great to see different perspectives of the same place. My photos became more refined throughout my childhood as I graduated to my stepdad’s Minolta film SLR. In college I dedicated myself to photography professionally with a degree in photojournalism, then found my calling with a wedding studio at 19.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We loved Nicky!

Hello All! I'm Steph... A wife of almost 15yrs to the love of my life, a mommy to 4 wonderful kiddos, and a very passionate photographer that absolutely loves to capture life's most memorable moments! Elopements and weddings are my favorite to capture, they are life's greatest and most special moments that a couple will share together. These moments will be remembered for the rest of the couple's life, their love and commitment to one another, and embracing their future life together. Capturing those moments for each couple to look back at, and re-live those special memories, brings me such happiness.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“I worked with Steph Liz Photography for both a Styled Photoshoot and Brand Photos for my Wedding Planning Business! Steph communicated quickly and effectively, showed up on time and had a great eye for photography. We got amazing photos for both shoots (a styled shoot is kind of like a fake wedding complete with a Wedding Couple, venue, etc.) Steph delivered the sneak peeks within a few days and the complete album quickly. I feel confident recommending her for any photography needs (especially Weddings! She took great photos for our Styled Shoot and really captured the vision for the day!). Highly recommend!”Janelle Granfors, 3 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/steph-liz-photography)

I have always had a passion for photography and once I picked up a camera, it was all over. I was raised from a big family and my kids are my world! Born and raised in the Bay Area, I have a special love for being back there. I consider myself very outgoing and will always try and make you laugh and feel comfortable by being a huge dork. I think that is one of the biggest compliments I get is that my clients always feel relaxed and at ease and I love hearing that. Not to mention becoming friends with my clients which is an added bonus! ​“Jeff was amazing! He made everyone feel comfortable in front of the camera and went above and beyond to “get the shot!” He has an amazing eye for detail, angle and creative shots I never would have thought of. We had a ton of fun with him getting some epic shots but also some silly ones too! I will be using him as our family photographer from here on out!”Michelle S., 4 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/jeff-hall-photography)

I’ve been capturing weddings, family lifestyle photography and casual portraits for more than a couple decades now working primarily in the Sacramento, Lake Tahoe, Napa, and San Francisco Bay areas, as well as all along the coastlines around San Diego and Coronado and everywhere in between. I’m inspired by outdoor adventures, travel, playful people, live music and amazing light and take advantage of any opportunity to capture raw emotion and natural beauty away from home.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We hired Lisa Richmond to photograph our wedding. She took beautiful photos (in a not ideal light situation) and really captured the spirit of the event. She is a gifted photographer with a keen eye for composition and character. She really got herself into the middle of all that was happening while at the same time was unobtrusive and respectful of the guests and the event. Such an amazing combination of skills. Lisa is also a joy to work with. She has a curious mind and that curiosity draws her into her subjects and creates beautiful work.

I really believe there should be very little reason for people to not get along. EVERYONE is welcome. I LOVE nostalgia, and having my work appreciated enough to be on your walls is the best feeling. I roast my own coffee, I am a friek for Legos, old black and white movies, the ocean, the forest, the jungle, and chatting with people.“Daniel Cewinski Photography was an outstanding choice for our wedding photographer. From the beginning, Daniel's communication style was assertive, positive, and thorough, putting us at ease throughout the entire process. His work is truly exceptional - passionate, professional, and sophisticated. On our wedding day, Daniel paid particular attention to our needs, being extremely accommodating with our family and sunset photographs. It was significantly beneficial to meet Daniel during our engagement photoshoot, as it helped us feel secure and motivated for the upcoming wedding.

Captured Cupid 5.0

  * Classic style
  * Starts at $1,000 
  * Serves Davis, CA

Captured Cupid is based out of Sacramento, California servicing clients from around the world. Primarily started as a wedding cinematography studio that specializes in storytelling style filmmaking. We love the challenge of producing such high-quality work for each individual because the emotional response is extremely rewarding for both our clients and our team. We would love to make introductions and chat with you about your wedding or special event.“Kevin was the best investment we made for our wedding. He went above and beyond for us. He stayed late at our wedding and gave us expert tips and tricks during our wedding to create a smoother event. The biggest problem I experienced during my wedding (and I assume most other do as well) was stress. Everything was flying at me and my then fiancé and the last person I expected to help comfort me and my wife and put our minds at ease was our videographer Kevin. He handled things with such ease and calmness. It honestly felt like he was the captain that kept out ship afloat. He’s more than a videographer. He helped organize and coordinate family/games/events during our wedding and truly did more than we could have ever asked for. Not to mention he even took incredible photos for us and had a entire edited album created for us the very next day. He displays the incredible professionalism and true care for his clients. I recommend his work to everyone and anyone. He is the best investment you could make for your most important day. My wife and I can’t thank him enough for what he did for us.”Mark & P., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/captured-cupid)
