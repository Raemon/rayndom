  * ### Don’t inquire with them

•Verified review

•Chaya P.•Jan 12, 2025

I would not recommend The Prestige Venue to any couple planning their wedding. From the moment we inquired about their services, they bombarded us with constant phone calls, sometimes reaching out 1-2 times per day. Their aggressive sales tactics were extremely off-putting and made the entire process very stressful. Unfortunately, I cannot speak to the quality of their work or value, as we ultimately decided not to move forward with booking them for our wedding. I would caution any couple to avoid this venue, as the poor communication and relentless outreach was a major turnoff.

Response from vendor•Jan 13, 2025

Dear Chaya Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We are truly sorry to hear that your experience with The Prestige Venue fell short of your expectations. We deeply regret that our communication approach came across as overwhelming and caused you stress during what should be an exciting time in your wedding planning journey. It was never our intention to make you feel uncomfortable or pressured. Our goal is always to provide attentive and timely assistance to potential clients, but we clearly missed the mark in your case, and for that, we sincerely apologize. Your comments have been taken to heart, and we are reviewing our processes to ensure a more thoughtful and balanced communication style moving forward. We wish you all the best with your wedding and hope your special day is everything you’ve dreamed of. If there’s anything further we can do to address your concerns or improve, please don’t hesitate to reach out directly. Sincerely, Joshua P Owner
