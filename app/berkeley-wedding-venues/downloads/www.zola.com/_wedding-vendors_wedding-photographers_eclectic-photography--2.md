Hi, lovers! 🤟🏽✨ Eclectic Photography has specialized in weddings and elopements for the past 3 years. I am a hybrid photographer combining the digital and analog (35mm film) formats to bring you a unique, timeless feel of your dream wedding day. We believe preserving memories in a way that reminds you of how your wedding day felt as well as staying true to the color of the details that made it YOU. We are based in Denver, Colorado ready to travel to wherever your love may take you. Send me an inquiry to book your consultation so we can bring your vision to a reality 🥂

Connecting with my couples is the most important part of booking with me. As an LGBTQ+ photographer and business owner, it is essential to highlight love in all forms. Feeling comfortable in front of the camera starts with knowing your love has a safe space for it to flow. I want us both to be excited to work with each other just as excited as you are for your wedding day. Being self taught wasn't enough for me so I am actively going to school for my BA in photography where I am constantly learning how to grow with my art. The more I learn, the more I incorporate into my business with passion and pure happiness.

•Verified review

•Maho Comer •Jul 1, 2024

We had the pleasure of working with Yulisa as the coordinator for a recent wedding, and she was fantastic! Yulisa is incredibly sweet and so much fun to work with. Both the couple and guests had a wonderful time during the portrait sessions. Her creativity with ideas is impressive, and it shows in every shot. Yulisa’s team is amazing, and their communication was top-notch throughout the entire process. Highly recommend Yulisa for capturing your special moments!

## Frequently asked questions

5 Answers

Ask them a question

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically, couples book me about 13 months before their wedding date. I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible about my availability, even if you’re planning on a shorter time frame.

### How many pictures will we get?

You can expect about 50 to 80 images per hour of photographing. But keep in mind this estimate varies depending on your wedding package, number of guests, venue type, and other factors.

### Will you edit all our pictures?

Definitely. All final images will be edited to ensure they look beautiful and in accordance with my portfolio.

### Do you travel?

Yes! Anywhere and everywhere! All my packages can be applied to any destination whether it's where you live, where your family is, or wherever you want to get married. Travel fees may vary due to location, time, and duration.

### Do you have insurance?

I do! Just let me know if your venue requires a certificate of liability, and I’ll send that over to them.
