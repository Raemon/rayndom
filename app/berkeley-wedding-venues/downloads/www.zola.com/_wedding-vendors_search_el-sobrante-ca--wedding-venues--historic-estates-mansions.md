We felt very heard and catered to. We received so many compliments from friends and family about the venue, staff, vendors, food, and music. It really is a "have it your way" set up, you can choose to have a big grandiose wedding or small minimalist wedding. I arrived to the venue on wedding day with zero nerves because I knew the staff and coordinator knew my expectations.”Aysaiah and I., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/4114f028-4335-4de9-b642-46714084461c?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/jefferson-street-mansion-by-wedgewood-weddings)

“We got married through the Riverside courthouse at the chapel. It was so easy and affordable, but also very beautiful and special. We were allowed to have up to 40 guests, which was exactly the size we were looking for. The chapel is gorgeous and the photos we got were stunning. I highly recommend as an alternative to a courthouse or city hall wedding.”Hayley P., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/thee-olde-chapel)

“The Riverside Art Museum was an absolute pleasure to work with for a wedding I DJ for. Their communication style was caring, thoughtful, considerate, detailed, and professional throughout the first of contact til day of the wedding, and throughout. The quality of their work and the overall value they provided was truly impressive - the venue was elegant, with breathtaking views that made for a truly memorable setting. When the ceremony ran behind schedule do to the bride not present as of yet, the staff was incredibly accommodating. One thing I must note that I don't see to often. They stayed out of the way until all of the guests had departed before efficiently breaking down the space. It's shows their thoughts are on the couples having a great time up until the last minute and giving the guest time to exit. Not trying to clean up and break down around the guest just to get off sooner. Kisbel (Event Manager) and the entire team felt like close friends committed to making their friends special day a success! I couldn't have asked for a better wedding venue and staff to had worked with for the first time. Highly Recommended!”DJ Zest for R., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/934a15ee-f83b-468a-870a-49ebc62f945c?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-riverside-art-museum)

Aphrodite’s Fountain 5.0 Mission Viejo, CA

When we were planning our own wedding, we were heartbroken. Every venue saw us as a "transaction," charging exorbitant fees for basic necessities. We couldn't find a place that felt magical within our budget. So, we decided to invest in our own home. We transformed our backyard into Aphrodite's Fountain—a tiered European-style garden complete with a stream, a custom altar, and a dreamy fog atmosphere. "Now, we open our gates to couples who want the fairytale without the financial stress."Why you'll love this venue

“Aphrodite's Fountain was the perfect venue for our wedding. From the very beginning, everyone was incredibly proactive and responsive, making the planning process seamless. The value we received was unbeatable - the beautiful garden setting was filled with love and care, creating a truly magical atmosphere for our special day. Our guests raved about the garden and the overall ambiance, which felt intimate and romantic. We couldn't have asked for a better venue to celebrate our marriage. Highly recommend Aphrodite's Fountain to any couple looking for a breathtaking, one-of-a-kind wedding experience.”Sed, a month ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/aphrodites-fountain)

“My dream wedding included walking down the aisle to the man that I loved. Found the dream man, just needed the dream place. My goal was to find a place that had character in itself. The Chapel of Orange was everything that I imagined. I visited a coupled more places, but the Chapel of Orange stayed in my heart. It was the right decision. The Chapel has a magical blend of classical charm and whimsical beauty that created the perfect atmosphere for our special day. Melissa was amazing throughout the planning process, and she, Cheryl, and the entire team worked tirelessly to bring our vision to life.

“Our wedding at Summit House Restaurant was an absolute dream come true. From the very first interaction, the team there was transparent, professional, and clearly knew exactly what they were doing. The natural beauty of the venue lent itself to so many unforgettable moments and photos that we'll cherish forever. The Summit House team, from planning and ceremony coordination with LeeAnn, to the entire service team during cocktail hour and reception, ensured everything was seamless. They made sure we were well-informed and had everything we needed, and we loved that we were able to secure our own vendors while also using a couple from their preferred list. The gorgeous landscaping, accessible location, great food and service, and affordable pricing made Summit House the perfect choice for our special day.

“The Grand Theater was a beautiful wedding venue, with a stunning space and amazing food. The staff was awesome and very attentive to our needs. However, we did have some issues with their communication and payment processes. There were a few instances where payments failed to go through due to their system having an error and they didn't tell us until days later. Towards the end, they also tried to overcharge us but we were able to catch these errors by referencing our contract. They quickly fixed the issues, but it was a bit frustrating to have to double-check and get everything sorted. Overall, the venue and staff were great, but be sure to carefully review your contract and keep on top of all payments to avoid any problems. I don't think any of the issues we had were malicious or done intentionally so I would recommend them!”Michaela A., a year ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-grand-theater)

The venue is an absolute hidden gem—stunning, intimate, and full of charm. Everything about my wedding day exceeded expectations. Fast forward to today, and I now have the privilege of working at Villa Del Sol as a preferred vendor through my wedding planning business, Mrs. G Events. It’s hands down my favorite venue to work with! I’ve come to know every detail of the space, and it’s a dream for both clients and vendors. The team of caterers is fantastic—professional, efficient, and always a pleasure to collaborate with. Cosmos Rentals is another standout partner, ensuring the setup process is seamless every time.

“From our venue tour to our tasting to our wedding day, Angie and the team at Colette’s and Muckenthaler Mansion were a dream to work with. They were communicative, clear, timely, and so helpful. It’s so convenient to have everything go through them, like tables, chairs, bar, staff, catering, linens, additional rentals, and cake. We were also able to bring in outside vendors like a photobooth and boba bar. We also used one of the rooms in the mansion to have a kids table with activities. This venue and catering were one of the most reasonably priced options, as well. We really felt like they were our cheerleaders doing everything they could to make our day smooth and memorable. Our guests could not stop raving about how beautiful the setting was. It’s great to be able to use any space on the property that you want, so we had each part of the night in a different space, which really made it feel cozy and homey like we were hosting a backyard garden reception and a party inside the mansion/gallery. We also felt great that the venue fee was a donation to the nonprofit cultural center. The food is delicious and the drinks were strong. The staff lead Anthony was at our beck and call all night, and thought of the tiniest details to enhance our experience. The bartender and servers were great too. I think everybody should get married here! The setting makes the day feel truly special and unique. And made a beautiful backdrop for photos. I can’t thank them enough!!”Sabrina P., 7 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/be2b6442-ebd4-4d7d-8f0f-08fe2ba160a9?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-muckenthaler-mansion)

“The Heritage Museum of OC is a beautiful little gem in Santa Ana. My husband and I knew after our first tour of the grounds that this was our wedding venue. We have zero regrets. It’s a gorgeous space! The house is beautiful and the grounds are well maintained year-round. Not only that, but the staff at the museum are so wonderful and easy to work with. Kaitlyn was our venue coordinator and she was fantastic from day one. She answered all of my endless questions throughout the wedding planning process and was always incredibly patient, helpful and kind. She really calmed my nerves the night before and the day of the wedding. The venue was also super flexible with last minute rainstorms. The canopies didn’t take away from how beautiful the venue is. I highly recommend getting married here rain or shine!”Lily K., 2 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/b3f8c4d7-2a60-4672-8c37-b0dc3d589193?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/heritage-museum-of-orange-county)

The photos were already beautiful, but in person, the location is even more stunning. The views are absolutely panoramic - we took the opportunity to take many of our favorite wedding photos. The deck was the heart of the event - spacious, comfortable, and just the right mix of laid back and elegant. There was plenty of room for everyone to relax, hang out, and enjoy the setting without feeling crowded. What we really appreciate was how much value we got for the price. We had a clear budget and were expecting to have to compromise somewhere, but this place delivered on everything - space, vibe, and setting - without breaking the bank. Highly recommend if you are looking for a private, scenic location that’s both relaxed and special.

“Tim and Kirsten were absolutely incredible. From the moment we met them, their passion for Stone Oak Manor and their genuine care for every guest were undeniable. Their love for what they do shines through in every detail they plan and every experience they create. My husband and I had the honor of being their very first elopement— and their first LGBTQ wedding! From the initial tour, we knew this was the perfect place to celebrate our special day. The manor is breathtaking, with stunning grounds and a cozy, inviting atmosphere. The warm scent of aged wood added to the relaxing and tranquil charm of the space. We can’t recommend Stone Oak Manor enough. It’s truly a magical place.

“I've been in the industry since 2014 and the Harper is by far one of my favorite venues to work at! As a planner/coordinator myself, I've worked with several venues and none are as professional and accommodating to its guests as well as its vendors. I always know that everyone that comes through Harper's doors are in good hands from beginning to end. Service is always impeccable--making the wedding planning process and the day-of as seamless as can be! I do not know any vendor nor any couple that has been dissatisfied with the Harper and this speaks volumes to how they treat the people they serve. Will continue to recommend the Harper to my clients who are looking for a beautiful, modern venue that will not disappoint!”Blaire Jo, 3 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-harper)

![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We just had our wedding at The Homestead and couldn’t have been happier! It was the wedding day of our dreams. Paula: she was so on top of everything at the rehearsal and on the day of, my family and bridal party really appreciated her thoroughness. She also was so accommodating to any requests we wanted for our wedding day! She and her workers spent so much time setting up our seating chart in such a beautiful way I would have never thought of. We had so many additional things planned for our wedding but she and her team made it all happen and run smoothly too! She even decked out our cake with our personal decorations using her creative judgement and it looked so cute. Email correspondences took some time to get replies, but texts and phone calls were promptly answered! DJ Milo: was a great MC and DJ. I was a little worried he wouldn’t play the songs we requested, as friends had that issue with different djs at their weddings, but every song was one we had asked for! Which really helped create the vibe we were looking for on our wedding day. He also flawlessly looped songs when some activities ran a bit too long. Haverland catering: the food was delicious and the portions were HUGE! I didn’t hear any complaints about being hungry. Desserts: pie and cake were both included in the package! And we had so much left over which was great because I wasn’t really able to eat much on the actual wedding day. They also let us bring macarons for an extra dessert table, and set it all up for us! Photobooth and late night treat: the guests always had something to do! Even if they weren’t interested in the dance floor. There was also areas to sit and talk peacefully away from the music. Bride whisperer: I even forgot about this until the day of the wedding! But I had an attendant with me the whole time to hold onto my bouquet when needed, get me water or drinks or food, and help me with my 3 costume changes. Dora: was so helpful in the girls cottage in the morning! Checking up on us every 15 minutes. And when the flower girl petals did not match the color scheme of the event, she and Paula went to get different petals. They really cared about all the little details! Florals: the flowers and table settings were beautiful, although not exactly what I was expecting. We had discussed moss for the tables but did not end up having it on the day of. Not a big deal, and the guests all thought the florals were beautiful. Bar Tender: was amazing! This venue is so good because it is BYOB. We were able to have 3 signature cocktails and she helped me to create the recipes and buy the proper amounts of ingredients. I was texting her back and forth making changes and tweaking the recipes until it was just right! She was always very responsive. The guests loved the drinks! The venue: speaks for itself, it is so beautiful! Our guests did not understand why we were getting married in Oak Glen, but once they were there they all understood. Also, when we booked the venue I was not thinking of this but it is ADA accessible. I ended up getting injured and needing knee surgery before the wedding so having an accessible venue was a great plus!”Amanda, a month ago![](https://images.zola.com/5ca17804-09af-414a-9c07-3be7be9f0cdb?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-homestead--3)

“Our wedding at the Stone House at Temecula Creek Inn was even more amazing than we had hoped. From start to finish, the team at Temecula Creek Inn was incredibly helpful, responsive and made the whole planning process easy. The tasting event and the signature drinks planning event were so much fun and a great date for the two of us before our big day. On the day of, the team handled everything so there was nothing we had to think about except enjoy the day. The space itself is gorgeous and our ceremony had a dreamlike quality. Having the ceremony, cocktail hour and reception all in the same area was so smooth, yet still felt like each space was its own. Additionally, many of our guests loved getting to stay at the hotel since many of our guests had come from out of town. All in all, it was the perfect wedding space.”Erin H., 2 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/temecula-creek-inn)

“Having our wedding at Rancho Bellasante was a dream come true! The McIntyre family were beyond kind and extremely accommodating to every need we had. The wedding coordinator, Tiffany, was instrumental in our successful wedding. She took care of every detail and made sure our experience stress free. The day of was so well orchestrated, we couldn't be more grateful. The best part of this venue is the the venue itself. The views are INCREDIBLE. They took our breath away from the second we stepped foot on the grounds. It's easy to access, easy to navigate and incredible for any type of wedding regardless of size and/or special accommodations. I couldn't recommend this venue more to people looking for a dream location for their dream day.”Cassidy & M., 3 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/rancho-bellasante)

## About wedding venues in El Sobrante, CA

### 

California offers an incredible 840 miles of coastline, 3,000+ wineries and ancient redwoods for your wedding day. When you choose the Golden State, you're getting exceptional natural lighting for your ceremony across diverse settings from Mediterranean coastal zones to alpine mountain backdrops. Each region has its own distinctive character that can perfectly match your vision.

### What Makes California Wedding Venues So Special?

Northern California's Napa Valley welcomes you with rolling vineyards and Spanish colonial architecture where intimate wine cave ceremonies create unforgettable moments. Head to Southern California and you'll find oceanfront venues like Duke's Malibu where you can exchange vows with the Pacific stretching out behind you while enjoying fresh coastal-inspired cuisine. Palm Springs offers dramatic desert venues with mountain backdrops and striking midcentury modern architecture that photographs beautifully.

### How Much Do Wedding Venues in California Cost?

Wedding venues in California typically run between $9,600 and $11,700 which aligns nicely with the national range of $6,500-$12,000. This represents about 18% of your total wedding budget. Your overall costs will vary based on guest count:

  * 50 guests: $26,190
  * 100 guests: $43,692
  * 150 guests: $60,141
  * 200 guests: $74,836

Accessibility options have improved greatly across California venues in recent years.

### When Should You Book Your California Wedding Venue?

October leads venue inquiries in California with couples typically booking venues about 13 months (400 days) before their wedding date. If you're dreaming of a Northern California wine country wedding during peak season you'll want to book up to 18 months in advance. Southern California venues offer more flexibility especially during winter months when you can still enjoy beautiful weather while potentially securing better rates.
