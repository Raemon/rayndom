My wife and I have been doing personalized art services for years, and have only recently started to lean into events. We love the idea of making lasting memories of people's happiest moments, and doing it in unusual and timeless ways! We like to travel so dont have any problem with destination events or stuff outside our home region. We also know planning these things is stressful enough already, so we keep things nice and easy for you. We're laid back in demeanor, but years of service industry work has made us efficient and attentive to detail.

The art we're doing is exceptionally rare, and is definitely a service you won't find anyplace else. We use a special box with a camera and darkroom built into it to produce paper negatives, which we then use to create paper positives. These are hand exposed, hand developed black and white photos using a process established by artists in the 1800s. They have a timeless, versatile quality that can capture a sweet moment or a celebration, conveying the life and emotions expressed for years to come!

**In three words:** Calm, Creative, Innovative

  * ### Fun and neat!

•Verified review

•GB•Jul 11, 2025

Alchemist Studio Box Photography was a cool and great value addition to our wedding day. They became a hub for a group of the reception party who spent ages taking pictures and having fun. The photographers were very nice and even helped out with other stuff sometimes. They were really attentive to what we wanted and the vibe of our reception, and were punctual and set up their area easily, with a great eye to how they fit into the space. People loved the box and the photos, and they were a pleasure to work with overall.

  * ### Unique process, neat photos!

They were super easy to work with, kept communication open and clear. Very accommodating, even traveled for us! Very self sufficient, once we figured out where they should set up we didn't have to worry about them the rest of the planning or setup days. Great value and fun for the price.
