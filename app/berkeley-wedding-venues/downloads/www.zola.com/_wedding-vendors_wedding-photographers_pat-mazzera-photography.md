Offbeat Photography with a Narrative Twist. I've been having fun photographing weddings for over 18 years. I find the excitement, nervousness, love, and joy inspiring to create great photographs that tell a story. I have been in love with photography since I've been a kid. Since then I have photographed actors, film directors, authors, and some very unique characters that have informed my perspective on life.

My offbeat editorial style isn't for everyone. But those that want a photographer who isn't your typical wedding photographer will be delighted with the uniqueness of their wedding photographs. Let me respectfully capture one of the most memorable days of your life. When you contact me, please let me know as many details about your wedding photography coverage needs: hours of photography, style, etc. and I'll be happy to reply.

  * ### Pat is an awesome photographer!

•Verified review

•Tori and S.•May 21, 2022

We hired Pat to do photographs for our wedding in 2016 - which was an informal event in our back garden in San Francisco with our family and friends on a glorious July day. Pat was lovely to work with. We only needed to chat a few times beforehand. And then on the day, she was a discreet, low-key presence - but somehow managed to capture us, our family, and friends in a joyous celebration.

  * ### Pat is the BEST!

•Verified review

•Justin and C.•May 18, 2022

Pat was amazing at our wedding, she'd show up at places, corners you never expected her to be, she'd hang from the ceiling if she could get a better shot! We felt like movie stars with the paparazzi's on us at all time! She shot from beginning to the end of the wedding party and came out with over 500 beautiful photos we will cherish for a lifetime. Thank you Patricia, you really captured to mood and what we worked so hard for to create a memorable wedding for everyone with the focus on us but also all of our guests and the three phases of the wedding. You did a AMAZING job!

## Frequently asked questions

9 Answers

Ask them a question

### How long have you been photographing weddings?

I've been photographing weddings for over 18 years. I'm also an editorial, portrait and event photographer, photographing film festivals, actors, directors and people in the news. So lots of varied experience in every single light situation.

### How many photographs can I expect?

I estimate I shoot about 50 photos an hour. Some of those will be edited out because someone blinks, or turn their backs, etc.

### Do you travel?

Yes, please! I want to travel especially to Las Vegas to get some great samples for my wedding site. I love the light, architecture and bling and bustle of this city. If you're traveling to Vegas, please contact me for a possible trade.

### How long will it take to see our photos?

I will send you a greatest hits within a couple of weeks after your wedding, and then the full edit within 4-8 weeks.

### Video?

I can't do both, but I can contract a videographer for your wedding.

### What's your backup plan if you can't photograph our wedding as planned?

I will contact my list colleagues in this situation. Because of covid, its mandatory to have a backup plan these days.

### Are you vaccinated?

Yes, boosted and boosted again!

### Do you work with assistants or 2nd photographers?

If your wedding is large, or complicated, I will hire an assistant or a second photographer to insure things go smoothly.

### What's the next step after choosing you as our wedding photographer?

I require 25% deposit and a signed contract of all parties. I will then secure your date on my calendar. I will then ask you for a shot list and a timeline at some point before your wedding.
