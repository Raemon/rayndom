Found Floral 5.0

  * Starts at $15,000 
  * Serves San Ramon, CA

My name is Judy Leung (she/her) and Found Floral is based in San Francisco Bay area & beyond. Found floral is rooted in intentional and modern approach to floral and event design. With a focus on creating a flowerful experience that celebrates the culture and stories that are uniquely yours.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Working with Judy at Found Floral was one of the best decisions my husband and I made during our wedding planning process! I knew I wanted florals that were textured and unique and not too cookie-cutter or traditional, so this was my top criteria when searching for a florist. Judy was able to masterfully bring the vintage backyard dinner party feel to our wedding which had 260 guests and still make our wedding feel unique (each table had different tropical and rarely seen flowers). Over 20 of our guests have mentioned to me since how much they loved the florals at our wedding since then - so many people have complimented our florals and shared that they are their favorite florals they've ever seen at a wedding and are still thinking about them today (some guests even have group texts focused specifically on our wedding florals)! The other big thing Judy did for us was the florals for the mandap (arch) for the ceremony - it was so spectacular and such an incredible focal point! It was raining for our entire ceremony so we were grateful to have a pop of color against the grey backdrop. The Found Floral team also used such unique flowers for the arch and laid them out in a way that was the perfect balance of textured but also refined (without being stiff or overly formal). My favorite part of working with Judy was that she took the time to understand my vision but then was able to operate and make decisions independently to bring that vision to life. There are 10000 things to do during wedding planning and it was such a relief to know we were in good hands with Judy and not having to make tiny decisions like picking out individual flowers or greenery or designing much of anything. I would work with Judy again in a heartbeat - she has such a chic unique style and is warm and makes her clients feel so comfortable at every stage of the process. Found Floral truly is the best florist in the Bay Area!!”Joanna K., 2 years ago![](https://images.zola.com/12e771a6-5cf2-412f-aac0-2cd9ab246860?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/found-floral)

Fleurisse Design 5.0

  * Starts at $8,000 
  * Serves San Ramon, CA

We are a husband and wife team with a love for the unexpected joy flowers can bring, and an artist's eye for design. We create with thoughtful intention to let the color, shape and texture of each bloom delight the viewer, letting nature and the garden inspire us.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“TLDR: Fleurisse Design (Willbe) not only beautifully brought our floral vision to life, adding the most important visual touch to our wedding, but was extremely easy to work with when it came to her quick & clear communication, accommodation to our budget & vision, and was both personable & professional. We first found Willbe through Instagram. We were immediately in love with her overall style and aesthetic that is both modern and whimsical. Bonus points that some of the gorgeous arrangements she makes are with blooms from her very own garden. We reached out to her and several other florists. After our initial correspondences and meeting, we ultimately decided to go with Willbe for several reasons (and we felt really good about that decision!): (1) Communication: From the get-go, Willbe was very responsive and has good communication systems in place. We submitted a form via her website, we corresponded over email, and we were able to set up a virtual meeting to chat. (2) Value: Willbe's prices were middle of the road (we got some lower and much higher quotes), and we felt that the product and services she was offering in exchange for the quality and design were well worth it. Additionally, she was willing to work with our budget and desire to have our guests be able to take home the beautiful arrangements! (3) Design: Of course her work is absolutely breathtaking and beautiful!!! My husband and I were planning our wedding from out-of-state from a different time zone, but despite that, Willbe stayed in touch throughout the process, so we were never in the dark. She walked through our floral inspiration pictures with and translated that into what would be executable on her end. In the days leading up to and on the day of, her and her team's professionalism, from asking about the venue layout, arriving well in advance, having everything ready to go, working with the outdoor ceremony elements - wind!, was very reassuring. On the wedding day, the flowers did not disappoint. The bouquets, boutonnieres, floral arch, and various centerpieces were each a piece of art. I'm so glad our photographer captured them, because they were absolutely amazing. When Willbe did the bouquet hand-off to me on the day of, it felt like my Pinterest board come to life (iykyk!). All the floral pieces invoked spring, soft pastel vibes that were airy, delicate, and breathtaking. She nailed the color palette and vibe perfectly. Some of the flowers (sweet peas) came from her own garden as well. The sweetheart table felt like we were sitting in a garden. We would definitely recommend Fleurisse Design to anyone looking for a wedding florist that excels in both creating beautiful floral pieces. We will cherish the flowers as part of our wedding for years to come! *All photos included in this review were photographed by Danya Chen Photography”Caroline Y., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/59f20c31-a27f-4bf3-a8ee-410fc3593a28?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/fleurisse-design)

Bluma: The Artful Botanic 5.0

  * Starts at $1,200 
  * Serves San Ramon, CA

I started Bluma: The Artful Botanic in the summer of 2013. I was doing flowers for several friends’ weddings when I decided to take the plunge and open a small business. Bluma is a delight and an incredible learning experience. I love it most because it combines two of my passions, flowers and art. Bluma: The Artful Botanic is based in Berkeley, CA. I design for weddings, anniversaries, memorials, bnai mitzvot, birthday parties, fundraisers, and other special events. I am open to inquiries of all kinds.“Bluma: The Artful Botanic was an absolute delight to work with for our wedding flowers. From the moment we connected, the team was incredibly helpful, kind, and bubbly in their communication style. They took the time to understand our vision and provided thoughtful suggestions that resulted in truly fresh, inspiring, and beautiful floral arrangements. I was living in NJ during the time of wedding planning, and they even texted me about what flowers were in season and were transparent with the pricing. Bluma's attention to detail and passion for their craft shone through in every aspect of their work, and they helped make our special day even more beautiful. I would highly recommend them to any couple looking for a top-notch wedding florist.”Julia V., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/640a05ce-adea-485b-9ead-7e70bc7095e3?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/bluma-the-artful-botanic)

I pride myself on good service and making sure my clients get what they need to make their day special.“Dwuna created a beautiful bouquet and pocket square for our small wedding! She was communicative and clear. When I didn't have an exact idea of what I wanted but gave a few examples of what I like, she created a gorgeous bouquet that fit the vibe of our wedding perfectly, at an affordable price! She also accommodated some changes I made along the way, such as ribbon color and swapping the boutonniere for a pocket square. Pickup went smoothly, and she packaged the bouquet in a smart paper vase with water, which made transport super easy as well.”Emma, a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/b32d364f-3017-49f9-b263-50833686af5e?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/pocketful-of-posies)

Pairs and Pieces Event Floral 5.0

  * Serves San Ramon, CA

Flowers are the most ephemeral, yet most memorable, elements of a wedding. Their presence transforms the venue and creates a beautiful and fitting ambiance for that special day. Choosing the right flowers to fit your wedding day is my passion. My design style can be romantic, modern, elegantly simple, or can be free spirited and unpredictable. I enjoy using unusual textures and often incorporate innovative and exciting elements in my designs. Since I work exclusively on events, I can devote my time to creating a truly remarkable event that is uniquely yours.“Eunice was so easy to work with! I had changed my bouquet design and added/removed pieces several times, and she was extremely flexible. Her pricing is very fair and she took my inspo photos and executed my vision perfectly. She really helped me achieve my dream wedding and can't thank her enough!”Ariana M., 7 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/pairs-and-pieces-event-floral)

In the heart of the Bay Area, where vibrant sunflowers once painted the landscape, Ada Wong's enchantment with flowers began. Growing up on a farm, she witnessed the magical cycle of life—from seeds planted with hope to the tender care as they blossomed, creating a symphony of colors. This early connection with the earth and its creations left an indelible mark on Ada's soul. Amidst the blooms, Ada's parents, diligent farmers, exhibited resilience born from the fields. Their unwavering dedication planted the seeds for Ada's love of the craft.“Ada was a pleasure to work with. She listened to my vision and executed it fully and beautifully. Everything was so elegant and stunning. I envisioned a wedding in Tuscany and my dream became a reality! I can't recommend Ada enough!”Alessandra S., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/ada-wong-design)

Nor did I want to spend thousands of dollars for flowers. They arrived the week of the wedding in a box. They put the shipping label in a pocket on the box. I slapped that label back on and sent them on their merry way back. It was the most simplest thing I have ever done. This is the way to do it.

Flower Moxie – Do-It-Yourself Wedding Flowers 4.9

  * Starts at $350 
  * Serves San Ramon, CA

In 2013, 8-year wedding veteran Amy McCord Jones realizes she wouldn't be able to afford to hire her own floral services if she was a bride. Then, Amy discovers that there is basically zero help available for DIY brides. No flower recipes. No instructions. No access to florist-grade blooms. Rude. So she launches Flower Moxie! Flower Moxie remains a humble, tucked-away small business out of Oklahoma City. We don’t zoom around on scooters in some fancy high-rise. We stock an average kitchen with canned wine and Aldi chips and listen to true crime podcasts while photographing curvy ranunculus. Join us. There’s cake, hugs, and acceptance here.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Flower Moxie – Do-It-Yourself Wedding Flowers was an absolute delight to work with for our wedding. From the very beginning, their communication was quick, helpful, and accommodating, making the process of planning our floral arrangements seamless.

They delivered everything exactly when they said they would, creating a magical look for our special day. Alexa, in particular, was absolutely the best to work with and went above and beyond to ensure we were thrilled with the results.
