My name is Connie and I have been shooting weddings and portraits for over 15years. The goal for me is to give my client an heirloom of their wedding day to pass down to generations to come. As a young kid, I remember staring at my parents black and white wedding photos for a long time. It captivated me. I am very lucky to have those memories and that is what I want for my clients. I love capturing beautiful imagery through posing, beautiful light and when there isn't light, I like to create it. I can be a goof ball capturing the unexpected filled laughter. Come look at my work, and hopefully we can connect.

I have a lot of experience in shooting weddings, working with all kinds of lighting situations, and working with people. I know where to place people in the correct light to fit certain situations. I also offer a variety of products to clients that some photographers do not like wedding albums, canvases and other products.

  * ### Beautiful Photography 

•Verified review

•Stacey and B.•May 21, 2024

Connie was so awesome to work with! Leading up to the wedding she was easy to communicate with and always responded to my emails quickly. When my wedding day rolled around she was at the venue on time and got to work. She was patient with everything going on, she had an assistant as well that was great! I told Connie that I was worried about taking pictures because I never considered myself photogenic, she told me not to worry. She did a great job! The pictures turned out beautiful! I love them! Now the hard part is choosing which ones to print.

I can’t recommend her enough, just book her! It will be the best decision you make. We will treasure our photos forever. Thank you Connie Leal photography!

  * ### Connie Leal creates lasting lifetime memories

•Verified review

•Linda B for B.•Feb 12, 2024

Connie Leal Photography was so great to work with to create lasting lifetime memories for our son's wedding in July. Her expertise and professionalism was a great relief and blessing. She and her staff created an atmosphere of confidence that made us all relax the day of the wedding. We were confident that she would get "the shot" and she definitely got more that "the shot". The amount of memories that she was able to capture exceed expectations. When meeting with her, she was able to entertain and answer all our questions and gave great suggestions. The day of the event, she and her second photographer worked in the background giving the bride and groom the ease of being in the moment. We just received our parents album and it is so wonderful and beautifully put together. Just know that there will be hard choices to make to narrow down all the great pictures that were captured into an album. Over all, the services provided and the work product were delivered at a very reasonable price. She was also able to recommend a videographer that worked seamlessly with her and her team. I highly recommend Connie Leal and her services! Thanks again for capturing those once in a lifetime moments.
