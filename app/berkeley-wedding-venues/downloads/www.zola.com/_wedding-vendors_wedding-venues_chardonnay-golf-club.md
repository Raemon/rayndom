## About this venue

Chardonnay Golf Club & Vineyards is an 18-hole semi-private Napa Valley golf facility located Southeast of the city of Napa in Jameson Canyon at the gateway to the world renown Napa Valley wine district. The Chardonnay Golf Club & Vineyards has seen hundreds of brides and grooms celebrate their nuptials on our property. Each wedding held at the Chardonnay Golf Club & Vineyards is a special event for us, as well as for the couples that wed here. Close to San Francisco, the East Bay and Sacramento, the Chardonnay Golf Club is the ideal “Napa Valley” location for a memorable, elegant wedding, offering two wedding sites – both with distinct and powerful appeal.
