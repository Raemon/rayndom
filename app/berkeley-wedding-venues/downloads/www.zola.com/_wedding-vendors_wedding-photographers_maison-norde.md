Maison Norde is a photography studio devoted to capturing weddings with a calm, cinematic sensibility. We blend film and digital to create imagery that feels textural, emotional, and enduring—rooted in light, intention, and the quiet moments that define a celebration.

Maison Norde is defined by an eye for quiet beauty—soft light, small gestures, fleeting emotion. We notice the things most people overlook and turn them into the images you’ll return to for years. Our approach is intuitive and unobtrusive. We give gentle direction when needed, but let the day breathe—so the images feel natural, atmospheric, and true to you.

  * ### Couldn’t ask for a better photographer! 

•Verified review

•Polina and I.•Nov 26, 2025

We got married at my parents’ property in Santa Rosa, and Daria from Maison Norde captured the day better than we could have imagined. It was a very personal, family-centered wedding, and she fit into it so effortlessly—calm, friendly, and somehow everywhere without ever feeling intrusive. She paid attention to things we didn’t even think about: the way the light moved through the oak trees, my parents bickering over last-something, the little in-between moments when we weren’t aware of the camera at all. Everything feels genuine and beautifully composed without being staged. When we got our gallery, it felt like stepping back into that day- warm, emotional, and honest. We’re so grateful we chose her. I honestly cried at our photos

  * ### Genuinely Obsessed!

•Verified review

•Zara•Nov 26, 2025

We got married at Sea Ranch and honestly didn’t expect anyone to capture the place - or us - the way Daria did. From the moment she showed up, she felt like someone we already knew. She never made anything feel posed or awkward; she just let us be, stepped in when we needed a little direction, and somehow caught every moment without interrupting any of it. When we saw the photos, we were blown away. The way she worked with the light on the cliffs, the grass moving in the wind, the whole atmosphere of the day… it all feels exactly the way it felt to be there. Our families keep talking about how lovely and professional she was, and half of them didn’t even notice she was shooting most of the time—yet she missed nothing. The gallery feels like a real story, not just photos. We’re genuinely obsessed and so grateful we chose Maison Norde.
