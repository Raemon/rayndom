Relationships and Connection - most important in life. That's what my photography is about. Love, joy, sweetness, tenderness - emotions to capture and communicate. These are what you want to see in pictures.

Emotion, lighting. I have years of experience, I've seen fads come and go, and my clients seek me out because they feel my photographs are about: connection. Professionalism. I've photographed over a thousand weddings, I've heard customer complaints and learned from them, I am not the photographer for all couples, I am the boutique photographer providing a niche service: Photography about connection, joy, family, and tradition.

  * ### Good photographer

•Verified review

•Don Melandry•Jun 19, 2024

I've worked with Eliot on various occasions and he is diligent, intelligent, efficient and a darn good photographer.

  * ### Highly Recommend Professional Photographer 

•Verified review

•Jennifer & C.•Jun 10, 2024

We met Eliot back in 2008 when he photographed our engagement and wedding photos. They turned out so beautiful and we received many compliments from our guests. We recently hired him to photograph my parents’ 50th wedding anniversary banquet, and once again, he did not disappoint with his work. He is patient and skilled with lighting, flexible and accommodates large parties, and is a natural at his craft. We would highly recommend Eliot to be your photographer for any special occasion.

## Frequently asked questions

4 Answers

Ask them a question

### How would you describe your style?

Classical and traditional. My clients want a timeles look rather than what style was in fashion at that moment. My photos evoke a sense of connection - either between viewer and subject, or between subjects. I am always looking for and creating good lighting. Two-dimensional pictures gain depth when shadows and light emphasize shape and texture. Rembrandt lighting is my goal, so I am always hoping to get directional, soft, lighting. If you don't feel the connection and see the lighting in my images, I may not be the right photographer for you.

### Why don't you use a second photographer?

The basis of my photography is connection. From the moment I arrive at a wedding I am creating relationships - mainly non-verbal. Connection increases during the wedding day. Relationship and connection show in the final images. A second shooter diffuses that connection. The two photographers become a team, rather than a person to relate to. Photographers who understand lighting, and have the equipment, don't want to give up a wedding day to be the second shooter. And, I alone am going to give you 500 to 1200 images. A second photographer's images are not why couples hire me: They want my emotions and technique.

### Will you answer my list of questions that I downloaded from the internet?

Yes, but that's missing the point. I create images with connection, relationship, and technical excellence. If you don't appreciate these qualities in my images, my correct answers will not make me the right photographer for you. My years of photographic study and experience, my devotion to technique and relationship, and professionalism gives you the assurance that I will provide more than what you want and expect.

### What about the list of "must get" images?

Your family tree and whom you've chosen for your wedding party are my first guide. Let's get the photograph that your parents and grandparents want, but more importantly, we need time to create images that show connection and love. We are social animals - of course we want photos with our high-school buddies, our back-packing group, my parents with their best friends. Tell me about those, of course. And we want Mom and our friends to be happy - so encourage them to request any photo they want. Not only are the images important, but working with me increases the depth of our relationship, and that shows in the final images.
