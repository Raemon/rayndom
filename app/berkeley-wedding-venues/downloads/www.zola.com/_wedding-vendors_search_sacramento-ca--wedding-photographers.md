Dream Capture Studios 5.0

  * Editorial style
  * Starts at $4,000 
  * Serves Sacramento, CA

I’m Carissa, a California-based wedding photographer specializing in true-to-color editing, candid documentary coverage, and natural, editorial-style portraits. My work focuses on real connection, emotional storytelling, and the in-between moments that define a wedding day. With more than a decade of experience, I photograph weddings with an intentional, relaxed approach that helps couples feel comfortable, authentic, and fully present. My husband, Tyler, joins me as our videographer, bringing the same warm, storytelling-driven style to every celebration.“Ethereal, candid, jovial, refined are some of the buzzwords that the images of our oak tree & hanging lights, spring evening, 100 person ranch wedding brings to mind. Carissa made sure to get an idea of our and our family's priorities and vision for our wedding day photography months in advance. As the day approached she nailed down specifics of timing and herding those dear to us to capture everything we wanted! She has an eye for catching family dynamics, sweet background moments, and her whole team is quick to drop to the floor to get the perfect golden hour angle, play with long exposure, or get some kids laughing! They coordinated wonderfully with our other vendors throughout the day on things like equipment positioning and audio capture. We knew we would love any photos of us as a couple on the happiest day of our lives, but the width of their professional and personal vision for the whole picture is what truly captured our hearts. Thank you Dugonis for loving on us!”Stina D., 2 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/579c0e74-72be-432b-8368-fb997987d218?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/dream-capture-studios)

I started shooting photos and video in Greece, and since moving to the US, I have dedicated myself to shooting weddings, elopements and engagements. I love being able to capture the love that my couples have for each other and the unique energy each couple has. I am always down to shoot in new locations and find the best place for my shoots!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We truly couldn’t have asked for a better experience than the one we had with Te Dua Weddings. From our very first interaction to the last moments of our wedding day, Enea and Hayley were an absolute dream to work with. They brought such professionalism, kindness, and an incredible eye for detail, which took so much stress off our shoulders and let us enjoy every moment. The photos and videos they created are nothing short of breathtaking. Every smile, tear, and joyful moment was captured in such a beautiful and natural way. Additionally, they provided us with a google drive link of RAW files, which shows just how much they care about giving their clients everything they could want. Enea and Hayley are not just talented; they are artists with a true gift for storytelling. They exceeded every expectation we had, and we’ll treasure their work forever.

Hey y'all, I'm Meagan! This is typically the section where I should hype myself up, but instead, I’m going to actually tell you about me! I am a Northern California couples, elopement, and wedding photographer who encourages all my clients to include their dogs! Wondering where Lou Grace comes from? My business name is a tribute to my late grandfather, my guardian angel, and greatest supporter. I drink iced coffee year-round and I prefer Dutch Bros over Starbucks. I love country music but listen to just about everything and love a good song recommendation. Also, I’m obsessed with my dogs! Let me know if we have anything in common :)“Meagan was as easy and comfortable to work with as a best friend on my wedding day. She checked in with me throughout the day, gave me clear cues to look good and kept the whole experience with photos so lighthearted and fun. She pulled me away for photos at the perfect times so that I was actually able to enjoy my entire wedding day without feeling like it was one big photoshoot. I even got all my photos done in time to enjoy almost my entire cocktail hour! The photos she sent literally the next morning made my friends cry they were so beautiful. The work speaks for itself!!!”Paige G., 2 years ago![](https://images.zola.com/7f0b3bcc-3a84-4a9f-b83d-59ae9475381c?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/lou-grace-photography)

Annie Hall Photography 5.0

  * Serves Sacramento, CA

This is for you, couples who have too many moments to be present for. You’ll have photographs that show the heart and soul of the day without having to stage or fake things for the camera. I'll make images that help you remember what happened, who was there, what it looked like, and what it felt like.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“It's easy to look through Annie's photos to see how amazing they are -- I loved her style from the moment I saw her galleries and I was hopeful that our photos would look just as great. Guess what, they are amazing!! She also delivered ALL of our photos in 4 weeks, when she herself got married 2 weeks after us! Maybe the most important piece of guidance that she gave us was to take as many family photos before the event as possible. That way you can focus on the fun once it starts. And let me tell you -- that was good advice. I didn't want to spend a second on more staged photos once the party had started! We actually got to attend part of our cocktail hour because of this. Of course every event is different, but my point is that she will be able to guide you in the right direction because she has a ton of experience. I loved working with her and you will too! Also I didn't even include the best shots because I want to keep our faces off the internet, but look at the range just in these photos! So fun.”Jessica, a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/6be92d90-649e-4d00-8a38-1b048a95c47a?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/annie-hall-photography)

I go the extra mile to understand your unique needs, wants, and values, and showcase your wedding memories with creative, emotional, and authentic photography.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We planned our wedding in just a few months and finding and selecting a photographer was one of the most important vendor to do list items. Courtland was hands down one of the best wedding planning decisions we made. Courtland was easy to communicate with all through our planning, had great reminders for various things we needed to collaborate on and was so dedicated to get to know us as a couple, our style, our family, our values and more. All that come to find out radiated through our end product, our wedding day photography! A wedding can be stressful no doubt, but our photography experience was not one of those stresses. Courtland was patient, creative, genuine, professional and so dang friendly it was simply nice to have him a part of our momentous day. Courtland noticed my husband did not have a wedding day worthy wristwatch and offered to swap watches! Courtland saved the day on that one, hah! Once the photography was ready, Courtland offered yet another experience with a private reveal session at a lovely theatre with wine and treats, and it was awesome. We are so thrilled with the end product and would 100% hire him if we had to do it all over again. If you are looking for a wedding photographer to truly capture your most special moments with care and true dedication to your all while feeling like a friend, then Courtland is your person! Thank you, Courtland, for such a fabulous output!”Elizabeth F., 3 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/courtland-photography)

I started with family sessions and more business minded sessions rather than weddings but after doing my first wedding for a friend I was hooked! Being able to help capture your special day, all of the memories from it and celebrate with you such an amazing milestone is my absolute pleasure. I love being your hype vendor and friend on your day as well as assistant. So let me know how I can help you!“As a bridesmaid, I had the chance to see firsthand how amazing she is to work with. She made the entire bridal party feel comfortable, confident, and at ease, even during busy and emotional moments. She was organized, calm, and knew exactly how to guide everyone while still keeping things fun and natural. Watching her capture the bride and groom’s special moments was truly impressive, and she never missed a beat. When I later saw the photos, I was blown away by how beautifully she captured the emotions and details of the day. Any couple would be so lucky to have her as their wedding photographer.”Maya A., a month ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/captured-memories)

Valley Images Photography 5.0 Sacramento, CA

  * Photojournalistic style
  * Starts at $2,950 

I have been photographing couples for nearly 13 years and have loved every minute of it. I have enjoyed following them through engagement, wedding, maternity and now family sessions. I have even become life long friends with some of them. I am a mother of 3 and have always loved art, and once I picked up my camera and found a way to tell others love stories, I knew I found what I was supposed to do.“Our experience with Valley Images Photography was fantastic from start to finish. Michelle, the lead photographer, was responsive, had clear communication, and was very accommodating throughout the entire process. Her artistic and creative approach resulted in stunning, high-quality photos that captured all the special moments of our wedding day. Michelle started the day by beautifully photographing our wedding details, which allowed us to relax and get ready without feeling rushed. She was flexible and able to go with the flow, which was greatly appreciated. Overall, we had a wonderful experience working with Michelle and Valley Images Photography, and we are thrilled to have these beautiful memories to cherish for a lifetime.”Nadia, 5 days ago![](https://images.zola.com/e67d7c6c-a3b5-4019-abb2-0bc091cd581e?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/valley-images-photography)

Hello, I am a Northern California and destination wedding photographer that could not possibly love her job anymore! Photography has been a passion of mine since a very young age, my mom was a portrait photographer and after being in front of her camera for too many years I decided to see what the fuss was about and get behind the lens. I launched this business less than a week after graduating from UC Berkeley in 2016. ​![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Claire produces absolutely beautiful images and is a joy to work with every time.

I’m a sucker for a story, especially a love story. Ever since beginning a love affair with photography in Scotland, I’ve worked to capture striking photography for hopeless romantics. From traditional weddings to elopements, I’m game to capture creative and sentimental moments in timeless color.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“PJ was easy to work with from the beginning. Always quick to respond, efficient emails which told us exactly what the next steps were on his side/what he needed from us/what to expect, all of which I appreciate as a bride trying to keep everything together! All our guests said he was everywhere talking pics, I realized I barely saw him at all! The sign of a good photog-everywhere and nowhere. We just received our photos back and they’re gorgeous!

Mary Meck Weddings 5.0 Sacramento, CA

  * Editorial style
  * Starts at $4,000 

Hi friends! I’m Mary, an elopement & wedding photographer splitting my time between Northern California and Colorado. I absolutely love capturing couples and weddings, and telling each unique love story in an artistic, thoughtful, and honest way. I have a candid + photojournalistic style- I love to capture those honest, fleeting moments that you don't expect to see again. While I won't pose you stiffly, I'll guide you and give you tips to bring out natural, and loving poses. I have a lot of experience working with couples who are a bit uncomfortable being in front of a camera, so don’t worry about being camera shy!“There are so many wonderful things we can say about Mary. Not only are her photos and aesthetic one of a kind, but her sweet, caring, and calm demeanor makes her a joy to be around. Mary first shot our engagement shoot back in October 2019. We met her beforehand to get to know one another, which we would never have thought to do, but are so glad she suggested this. It made us more comfortable with her during the photo shoot process. We started at sunset and the weather was perfect. Towards the end, the weather suddenly become extremely windy and freezing cold. Despite being uncomfortable due to the 30mph and 30 degree wind, Mary kept us laughing and happy to be there. She was also a trooper, as it was so cold! Our photos turned out more beautiful than we ever would've expected. To say she is talented is an understatement. We then had Mary booked for our big wedding in Denver in September of this year (2020). Like many other couples, we had to cancel due to the pandemic. We changed our plans multiple times, and Mary was there to support us throughout, even if just to talk through things. We finalized our plan and eloped - just the two of us and Mary - and we could not be more happy with that decision. Being the only person to witness our ceremony and vows in the mountains, as well as one of the very few to be there while we individually got ready for the day, she made us truly feel her appreciation and love of being there with us and for us that day. She told us that she was honored to be there, and we knew that she meant that, very much so. We also feel honored that she was able to be there to capture our biggest day. Mary will always hold a special place in our hearts. We look forward to having her at our 1-year anniversary party/wedding reception next year, and for other events in our future.

Hi! My name is Joymar, but you can call me Joy. ¡También hablo español! I’ve been a photographer for over 6 years, and I bring a cheerful, high-energy vibe to every wedding I capture. My goal is to keep the atmosphere light and stress-free so you can fully enjoy your day while I document all the moments that matter most.“Hiring a photographer 1 week before our Wedding Day was so stressful! However finding Joymar on Thumbtack was an absolute blessing. He made us feel comfortable and at ease right from the start. He called and told us about himself and gave us such an amazing price we surely couldn't pass him up. He arrived early to the venue, went straight to work and stayed all day. At the end of the reception he showed us a sneak peek of 25 photos and they look amazing! We are so excited to see what else is to come. He was so professional, funny, humble and such a "joy" to work with, we will definitely recommend his service to anyone looking for a photographer.

Hey there! I’m Alana. I’m based in Northern California but willing to travel anywhere your love takes us. My awesome Hubby - Richard is my amazing right-hand man and my second shooter. We've been married since 2017 and together we form an awesome team to document all the important moments. We're just a couple in love who loves to document other couples in love :)“Alana Monét Photography was an absolute pleasure to work with for our wedding day. From our initial consultation to the final delivery of our photos, their communication was efficient, timely, and personable. The quality of their work was truly exceptional - they were detail-oriented, capturing high-quality images that perfectly encapsulated the day the way we wanted to remember it. Alana and her husband were committed to ensuring our special day was documented beautifully. This couple was a blast to work with, and we hope to have the opportunity to get another set of photos done with them in the future!”Maddy B., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/6fa63bcf-a6b5-4584-ae4b-ef8226573f32?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/alana-monet-photography)

Caffeinated Candids Photography 5.0 Sacramento, CA

  * Photojournalistic style
  * Starts at $1,500 

Hello! I’m a Sacramento-based candid wedding and portrait photographer with a passion for vibrant, colorful images—a love that began nearly 15 years ago as a U.S. Air Force public affairs photographer. For over a decade, my journalistic approach has allowed me to capture life’s most meaningful and exciting moments. I value careful planning and preparation, but I also understand that sometimes the best moments happen spontaneously. I strive to balance attention to detail with flexibility, ensuring every experience is both thoughtfully executed and naturally memorable.“Caffeinated Candids Photography was absolutely amazing to work with for our wedding. From the moment we first reached out, their communication style was top-notch - they were always quick to respond, answered all of our questions, and made us feel at ease throughout the entire process. The quality of their work and the value they provided was excellent. They perfectly captured every special moment of our wedding day, from the intimate exchanging of vows to the lively dance floor. We couldn't be happier with the beautiful photos that will allow us to relive our wedding day for years to come. Caffeinated Candids Photography truly went above and beyond to make our day so special.”Hailey A., 8 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/caffeinated-candids-photography)
