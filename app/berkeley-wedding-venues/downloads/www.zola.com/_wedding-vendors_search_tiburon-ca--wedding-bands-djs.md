I requested a Roaring Twenties theme from Louis Pettinelli and they went above and beyond to make it happen. The singer Karlea was phenomenal and did an amazing job of keeping our guests engaged and entertained. The musicians were all courteous, professional, and exceptionally talented. They dressed appropriately for our wedding theme and many of the guests at the Hawthorne Hotel wanted to take pictures with Karlea in her Twenties attire. In addition to being a wonderful experience, they were also a great value for the price. These are top quality musicians and we paid a reasonable price for the band. I highly recommend this group for your wedding.”Rochelle P., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/836d9cae-6881-486f-903f-96bf0faa8bfb?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/louis-pettinelli-entertainment)

  * Serves Tiburon, CA

DM me on instagram or facebook, I don't respond to inquiries from here. I started DJ’ing as a kid with two boom boxes, cassette mixtapes, and a deep love for music. I got into Turntablism and DJ’ing as an art form after completing a term in the Air Force. That's when I expanded my love for music and worked my way through college DJ’ing and doing voiceover. At Cal State I earned a B.A. in Film & Audio Production, and I then went on to become a certified Audio Engineer. When it comes to DJing for private events/venues like club rentals, weddings, corporate parties etc, I love my clients, and thrive on making meaningful connections.](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/dj-wayne-noel)

The team was professional, great at communication, very kind and professional, and they helped make our day absolutely perfect! Jeff, our DJ kept the dance floor alive ALL NIGHT!! When the music had to stop at the end of the night, the dance floor was still completely full and no one wanted it to end. He did a great job announcing the events of the night, made sure that our ceremony music was perfect, and he stuck to our wedding playlist with the exception for a couple guest requests (which we were happy to allow). We were so happy and thankful to have Jeff there! Sie, our videographer also did a wonderful job! We have not yet received our video as our wedding was less than 2 weeks ago, but I already know it is going to be amazing. He was so great with communication, was prompt with his timing, and he even set up a second camera for guests to break away and give us well wishes for our marriage, which I'm so excited to watch back. He was very professional and wonderful to work with. We decided to add videography at the last minute because we thought we might regret not having it, and I am SO happy we asked Jim at Direct Entertainment if they had someone available for our day just a month before, and they did!! Jim, the coordinator at Direct Entertainment frequently checked in with us, asked us questions about ourselves, and genuinely made us feel like he cared about us and our special day. He was great to work with leading up to being assigned our designated DJ and videographer, and even after, he checked in to make sure we were happy and that all of the planning was going well. Overall, we would 1000% recommend Direct Entertainment for any wedding entertainment needs! I know they also offer several other services that we did not utilize, and I'm sure they are wonderful as well!

I’ve been playing weddings for over twelve years and I love my work! My services cover any or all aspects of wedding & receptions. I have found my life’s artistic calling in becoming flexible to every type of music my clients could desire. I learn to enjoy whatever my clients love and this resonance makes my job sustainable and ever-enjoyable. But, I do tend to request the ability to make choices for the dance-floor that rely on my years of dance-enhancing experience. I meet with my clients to determine what music they would love to hear and what music they do NOT want to hear.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We were incredibly fortunate to have Brandon Bosch from The Celebration DJ at our wedding. His meticulous preparation and professionalism before the event ensured everything ran smoothly. Brandon's ability to keep us on schedule was invaluable, and his flexibility allowed us to effortlessly include an additional speaker during the speeches. The bundle package he provided was fantastic and truly enhanced our venue. The photobooth was a massive hit with our guests, and the sound quality of his equipment was flawless. Brandon's exceptional service made our wedding day perfect, and we highly recommend him for any special occasion!”Katerina M., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/b1ce8954-d59c-4953-8a07-7715715a8052?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/the-celebration-dj)

Leading up to the wedding, she was super helpful in guiding us through the steps to set up playlists and coordinate the intros/outros of the bridal party. Our wedding was spread out over a large property, and she had zero issue running speakers to each area, providing a festive, cozy atmosphere! We had a couple live performances and she was very accommodating in getting mic stands and cables all ready to go. Then the DANCING began! Lights, speakers, the whole deal - Ashley killed it! We leaned into more 70’s and 80’s music, and Ashley completely understood the assignment. Needless to say, the music mix was brilliant. Since then, we have had at least a dozen of our friends and family tell us that this was the most fun they have ever had at a wedding. I have no doubt that Ashley is 99.99% responsible for that.
