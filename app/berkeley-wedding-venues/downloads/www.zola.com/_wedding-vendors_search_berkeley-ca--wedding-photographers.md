I am an elopement and wedding photographer based in Northern California, who shoots for the fun quirky weirdos who are unabashedly themselves.

Relationships and Connection - most important in life. That's what my photography is about. Love, joy, sweetness, tenderness - emotions to capture and communicate. These are what you want to see in pictures.“We met Eliot back in 2008 when he photographed our engagement and wedding photos. They turned out so beautiful and we received many compliments from our guests. We recently hired him to photograph my parents’ 50th wedding anniversary banquet, and once again, he did not disappoint with his work. He is patient and skilled with lighting, flexible and accommodates large parties, and is a natural at his craft.

HI, I’M ESMERALDA AND I AM A WEDDING & PORTRAIT PHOTOGRAPHER BASED OUT OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND I LOVE WHAT I DO. I SPEND MY FREE TIME TRAVELING, PHOTOGRAPHING LIFE, AND ENJOYING THE COMPANY OF MY FAMILY + FRIENDS.“Esme was amazing! Her communication throughout the entire process was prompt and professional. She made us feel extremely comfortable on the day of and acted as a day of planner for our ceremony. Not only did she do a great job at taking the photos, but she made our families feel comfortable in front of the camera. They still talk about what a great job she did and we’d love to book Esme again for family photos!”Xitlali S., 8 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/bbae30f6-dd97-4cea-8b16-9cbbd1428f02?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/esmeralda-franco-photography)

I'm Ilva, a traveling wedding and elopement photographer based between Stockholm, Sweden & Edinburgh, Scotland. I am looking for flattering light and genuine moments whether it be close to nature or in an urban setting. I am there for couples who wish to take their day slower. They value images that can let them remember how it felt throughout the day as it unfolded. Together we keep it real, romantic, and joyful in beautiful surroundings. I photograph intimate and large weddings, but above all I love couples who celebrate their union for themselves.](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/ilva-photography--2)

Ivan Duran Photography Berkeley, CA


I am an award-winning photographer based in San Francisco and the Bay Area. I was born and raised in Guadalajara, Mexico. As a kid, I loved painting & drawing just as much as I loved taking apart wrist watches and fixing car radios. It wasn't until I picked up a camera as a teenager that I found an activity that combined my artistic sensibilities with my love of technical challenges. Photography has been my passion ever since. I bring a happy, relaxed energy to every job I shoot. In general, I'm more of a listener than a talker. When I'm not taking pictures, you'll find me salsa dancing, or playing ukulele very badly, though joyfully!](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/ivan-duran-photography)

  * Serves Berkeley, CA

I'm Katherine, a wedding photographer based in Oakland, CA. With over a decade of experience and features in Vogue, Brides, The New York Times, and more, I know how to create wedding photos that don’t just look stunning — they feel like you. No trendy filters, no forced poses, just authentic moments that reflect who you are. I believe the best moments aren’t staged. They unfold naturally, in the quiet glances, the belly laughs, and those unspoken connections shared with your loved ones. My goal is to capture those raw, in-between moments that truly make your wedding day yours!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“This review is long overdue. Working with Katherine was, without question, one of the best decisions we made for our City Hall wedding in May 2025. Months of Instagram research led me to Katherine. I started following her work before I was even engaged. She is phenomenal at what she does. From our very first interaction, her communication was exceptional. Katherine is prompt, thoughtful, and genuinely attentive. She took the time to truly understand our vision, ensuring every image beautifully reflected the aesthetic and overall tone we hoped for. Beyond her remarkable talent behind the camera, Katherine was an invaluable presence throughout the planning process. She went above and beyond to help us develop a clear, well-organized schedule, which made our wedding day feel effortless and seamless, which she absolutely did not need to do (I still appreciate you so much for this Katherine). Her calm, confident guidance kept everything on track and allowed us to fully relax and enjoy the moment, knowing we were in capable hands. What truly sets Katherine apart is her warmth and presence. She has an incredible ability to make people feel comfortable and at ease, and our friends and family immediately felt that. My mother-in-law continues to remark on how much she loves Katherine and how wonderful she was at our wedding. Katherine blended naturally into the celebration while still providing gentle direction, managing group photos with efficiency and grace so that everyone felt seen and comfortable. When we received our gallery, we were absolutely blown away. Katherine has a rare eye for capturing intimate, emotional moments, many of which we didn’t even realize were unfolding at the time. There is a specific image she captured of my husband laughing while his grandfather is speaking during our ceremony; we could not figure out when it happened. It was not until we watched the video of our ceremony did we see it happen. It was a split second reaction and Katherine captured it beautifully. We asked that our wedding photos feel like an inside-joke but anyone looking in still feels like they are in on the joke and that is what she delivered. The photos are not just beautiful images; they are meaningful, timeless memories captured with care, intention, and artistry. There is just something so special about Katherine's work; she perfectly encapsulates every emotion in a photo. Seven months later, I'm still in awe. We are deeply grateful to Katherine for capturing our wedding so perfectly. If you are looking for a photographer who is highly organized, incredibly talented, and a true joy to work with, we cannot recommend her highly enough. Thank you a thousand times again Katherine! All our gratitude, M & S”Matt & S., a month ago![](https://images.zola.com/dc3a5268-ff12-43ec-aae5-72ee1cba0887?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/weddings-by-katherine-marchand)

My name is Thomas Seabury I am a wedding photographer of 9 years, over the past 5 years shooting just over 100 weddings per year. Each wedding I take on the roll of coordinator, photographer, and personal assistant keeping the entire day running smoothly and keeping the stress of the day as far from the bride and groom as possible. I would love to be a huge part of your entire process from overall planning to execution of the day! In the off chance you're booking at a Northern CA Wedgewood venue, I have hundreds of hours of experience at each of their venues and work very closely with the everyone of the staff at Wedgewood.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Thomas is the best! He is unbelievably talented and his communication throughout the entire process was clear, professional, and reassuring, which made everything so smooth and stress-free. He captured every special moment beautifully and from all the perfect angles. The photos are stunning and feel so natural and timeless. We’re so grateful to have these amazing memories to look back on, all thanks to his talent and eye for detail. He also included an engagement shoot that we had a couple of weeks before the wedding and those pictures are just unbelievably beautiful! He will tell you which poses to do and guide you to make sure the pictures come out perfect and natural. The number of pictures that he delivered was insane, and they’re all amazing! He sent over some pictures the day after the wedding and sent the complete list of pictures just a week after the wedding, which is an insane turnaround! He also had a couple of small cameras lying around and gave them to bridesmaids to capture their perspectives of our wedding. Thomas was the perfect person for the job and I highly recommend him if you’re looking for the absolute best wedding photographer! Several of our family and friends told us he is the best photographer they have ever seen as they watched him sprint all over the venue throughout the night to capture every single moment of our magical evening. That’s enough of me talking, you can take a look at some of the pictures he captured, his work is the best I’ve ever seen and it was an absolute pleasure to work with him!”Chris G., 9 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/ba4c96df-4ff6-45a3-80f8-215f1068f2b1?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/twentythreeninteen)

From the very first interaction, EJ & Sarah's communication was exceptional. They made us feel comfortable and confident every step of the way, ensuring that every detail was covered and that our vision was understood. Their organizational skills were impeccable, leaving us stress-free and able to enjoy our big day. On the wedding day, their team was phenomenal. They were everywhere, capturing every special moment, yet they were so discreet that we barely noticed their presence. Their creativity and attention to detail were evident in every shot. The candid moments especially, were some of our favorites. When we received the teaser film and the photos, Meredith and I were left speechless. The quality and artistry of their work are beyond words. Every shot, every frame was beautifully, bringing out the emotions and joy of the day in a way that we will cherish forever. Their passion and dedication were clear in every aspect, from the carefully planned photo setups to the spontaneous video moments they were able to capture.

I’m Cherlyn (rhymes with Berlin). So nice to e-meet you! If we met in person and it wasn’t during a pandemic- I would probably hug you! I’m an introvert-extrovert and tend to ramble too much when I get nervous. In emails - I tend to use exclamation points a lot!! (and will agonize over my drafts of emails before sending them because they probably have one too many!!)

She had experience photographing there before, which was a major reason why I picked her to document my special day, in addition to her documentary-style photography which suited my shy spouse. I wanted someone who would be able to take formal photographs in addition to candids for the courthouse wedding and Chinese dinner to follow, and she more than understood the assignment. She took the time to scope out scenic areas near the office and even stayed for the dinner afterwards. She was a wonderful conversationalist and helped everyone feel at ease. I really treasure all the moments she was able to capture for us.”Jia Lian Y., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/cffc5e95-fa23-4685-afa1-211483f2576a?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/c-wagner-photography-design-llc)

She made the whole process so simple and adapted to our situation. I think most couples are more organized than we were, but she was able to go with the flow and fit right in. She’s so easy to talk to and friendly, that we were all completely relaxed with her and had such a nice time.

Hannah Berglund Photography 5.0

  * Photojournalistic style
  * Starts at $10,500 
  * Serves Berkeley, CA

I'm Hannah, a full time wedding and portrait photographer in Livermore, California. To me, photography is so much more than just hiring another vendor. And that's why you should choose someone you truly love to work with! I believe the real magic happens during the in-between moments – a secret smile shared by the parents; a tearful hug with the maid of honor; a quirky moment with the best man. These memories are far more precious than any staged photo, and these are the memories I want to capture for you on your big day.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“If you are reading this you should stop here and just go book with Hannah! Seriously, do it! Hannah is the whole package. Her personality is to die for. Her attention to detail is impeccable. Her talent is just out of this world. Hannah really invests in her relationships beyond just the photographer at your wedding. She makes an impact and it comes through in her storytelling. I love looking at my photos she has taken. I still cry happy tears because they are just that beautiful.”Sharyce, 6 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/hannah-berglund-photography)

Follow me on Instagram *vanessamontanophotography I’m Vanessa—Bay Area born and raised, living my dream under the California sun with a camera always close by. When I’m not documenting life’s beautiful moments, I’m likely in the kitchen testing new recipes, catching up with friends over a dirty martini, cruising with country music turned up, or spending time with my family. Photography isn’t just my work—it’s something I truly love. I feel incredibly grateful to witness and capture so many meaningful stories.“We are so happy we had the opportunity to have Vanessa capture our special day! The quality of her work is exceptional, with beautiful colors and candid moments filled with love. Vanessa constantly checked in to make sure we got the shots we wanted, and went above and beyond to focus on capturing the special interactions between our family and friends. We couldn't be happier with the final photos - they truly helped make our special day even more memorable.”Kennedy M., a month ago![](https://images.zola.com/fd73e18a-e886-4a7f-819f-837485892581?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/vanessa-m-photography)

Hi, I’m Hayden! With over 300 weddings captured, I take a journalistic approach to photography, documenting authentic moments as they naturally unfold. I shoot with both film and digital to create timeless, heartfelt images that tell your unique love story. With a go-with-the-flow mentality, I will capture moments as they come and turn them into beautiful memories.“Hayden was absolutely fantastic! Not only did he bring his own camera and film to contribute to the retro vibe of our wedding (photo attached), he worked perfectly with our friend and videographer to get some incredible shots of my wife and I. His demeanor and humor made it so much easier and more fun to take photos and really set us at ease. He posed us in such a natural way that didn’t feel awkward at all and the photos were absolutely stunning. To top it all off, he saw my groomsmen and I setting up chairs for the ceremony and he pitched in to help us carry them! I cannot recommend him enough, he’s the man.”Austin, 8 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/8de76ede-df31-4123-8bd1-7badfeba992e?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/he-photo--2)

Connie Leal Photography 5.0

  * Editorial style
  * Starts at $2,200 
  * Serves Berkeley, CA

My name is Connie and I have been shooting weddings and portraits for over 15years. The goal for me is to give my client an heirloom of their wedding day to pass down to generations to come. As a young kid, I remember staring at my parents black and white wedding photos for a long time. It captivated me. I am very lucky to have those memories and that is what I want for my clients. I love capturing beautiful imagery through posing, beautiful light and when there isn't light, I like to create it. I can be a goof ball capturing the unexpected filled laughter. Come look at my work, and hopefully we can connect.“Connie was so awesome to work with! Leading up to the wedding she was easy to communicate with and always responded to my emails quickly. When my wedding day rolled around she was at the venue on time and got to work. She was patient with everything going on, she had an assistant as well that was great! I told Connie that I was worried about taking pictures because I never considered myself photogenic, she told me not to worry. She did a great job! The pictures turned out beautiful! I love them! Now the hard part is choosing which ones to print.”Stacey and B., 2 years ago![](https://images.zola.com/bb7b67fb-32e6-4ab5-86b0-0d09d0e9be9a?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/connie-leal-photography)
