From start to finish, the entire experience was seamless and truly exceptional. A huge shoutout to Manoj, who coordinated everything to absolute perfection! From the drinks menu to the décor, food, and every tiny detail, he ensured that everything was executed flawlessly. His professionalism, attentiveness, and dedication made all the difference, allowing us to simply enjoy our special day without a single worry. The venue itself is stunning, with elegant décor, ample space, and a warm ambiance that set the perfect tone for our celebration. The catering was phenomenal, with a delicious spread that our guests couldn’t stop raving about. The food was fresh, well-presented, and customized to our preferences, making the dining experience truly delightful. A special mention to DJ Ellis, who absolutely rocked the night! His energy, music selection, and ability to keep the dance floor alive made the party an absolute blast. The dance floor was electric, and our guests had the time of their lives dancing the night away! A big thank you to Hugo for crafting amazing drinks that kept the spirits high throughout the night! His skill and creativity behind the bar made the experience even more special for our guests. A huge thank you to Arunji, Sunilji, and the entire team at Shubham Halls for making our silver jubilee celebration a grand and unforgettable affair!

“Took a few emails to find the right person to manage a block of rooms for my daughter's wedding, but once we hooked up with Madeleine, everything went smoothly. Madeleine answered all my questions via email and phone since I was halfway across the country trying to set this up. Location was convenient to Winchester Mystery House, where our wedding was held. Small shopping plaza across the highway from the hotel had eating and shopping options and the Plaza was just a few minutes away.”Oct 2023_Wedding R., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/shashi-hotel-mountain-view-an-urban-resort)

You'll find The Domain Hotel hosts lifecycle celebrations with facilities that partner with external AV providers to enhance remote guest experiences.
