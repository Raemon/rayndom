  * ### AMAZING!

•Verified review

•Linda H.•Dec 30, 2025

Left this same review on The Knot! I had to review this place on more platforms because of how amazing it was! We truly cannot say enough amazing things about this venue and the team. The space itself is absolutely stunning—it felt magical the moment we walked in and somehow looked even more beautiful on our wedding day. The entire team was incredibly kind, attentive, and genuinely excited for us, but Kelly deserves a special shoutout. We absolutely loved her. She went above and beyond in every possible way—most memorably by framing one of our wedding photos and sending it home with us. That alone shows how much she truly cares. The food was incredible, and our guests are still talking about it. We were having so much fun dancing that we didn’t even finish our cake, and the team thoughtfully saved it for us, which meant so much at the end of the night. The pricing was also very budget friendly, and they truly work with you to make your vision happen within what you can afford, which made the planning process so much less stressful. Everyone is still telling us how beautiful and fun our wedding was, and it honestly means the world to us. Knowing that our guests felt the love, joy, and magic of the day makes our hearts so full. None of it would have been possible without this incredible team and Kelly, who put so much care into every detail. We will always be grateful for everything they did to make our wedding day unforgettable, and we cannot recommend this venue enough.

  * ### Eagle Ridge is a 10/10, DEFINITELY would recommend

•Verified review

•Nichelle P.•Oct 2, 2025

I would recommend Eagle Ridge to anyone over and over and over again. They set the bar so freakin’ high for what a planning team, event team and venue should be for weddings. The staff are incredible. Big shout outs to Priscilla, Jennifer, Casey, Kelly and Xochi. The process from beginning to end was enjoyable and memorable, all because of the staff. Special thanks to Jennifer, Priscilla and Casey for being so attentive and responsive to us during the planning process. The food is so GOOD!! Weddings are always hit or miss when it comes to food, but Eagle Ridge kitchen really delivered! Eagle Ridge had that vintage, warm, romantic feel that we were looking for. It was hard to envision as we were going in for meetings what it would be like on a wedding night, but the photos they gave us provided a really good example of what things COULD look like, and the venue far exceeded our expectations on the day of. The ceremony space was beautiful, and didn’t need too much to spruce it up. The venue itself is filled with many photo op worthy places for photographers and guests alike, and I love that the bar is built in. The way that Eagle Ridge is described on the Wedgewood site is 100% accurate to what it feels like on your wedding day. Everything about this day was perfect. We opted out of draping and any arbor draping for the ceremony space because we knew we had chosen a space that was just architecturally beautiful as it is. It’s not often that you can just walk into a venue and be like “yeah, it’s actually so beautiful just the way it is.” I had printed guides for how to set things up, but for the most part, I just gave high level instructions and told Kelly (our day of coordinator, who was just so incredible btw!!) that I trusted her and her team to set things up the way they felt it fit best. I left some extra decoration items as well, and said they were optional to use if they wanted to. The biggest thing I left up to her and the teams discretion was our arch. We made the floral sprays for it but didn't know what to do with the draping. Let me just say, I was so unbelievably impressed with how everything turned out. Kelly and the team that set up our wedding absolutely KILLED it!!! Everything was so beautifully set up, the arch was better than I could have done myself, the ceremony space was so beautiful, and all the signage was set up perfectly. As a Type-A personality, it felt hard to relinquish control over the small details, but the Eagle Ridge team made me feel comfortable and I didn’t think twice about it. They most certainly delivered! Our Banquet Captain Xochi also was a total boss!! She made sure the night ran smoothly and I never found myself looking for her, she was always close by if I needed her help on something. The night went off without a hitch because of Xochi and her attentiveness! I’ll say it again, yes the building and the venue itself is beautiful, but it’s the team that truly makes the experience what it is. If you want to feel taken care of, seen, heard and like you can trust people the moment you go hands off, Eagle Ridge is it. I will be replaying this day over and over and over again in my head for as long as I live, and it’s all thanks to the work that the team that helped us through it all put into it.

  * ### Wedding 5.30.25

•Verified review

•Nakiya and R.•Jun 6, 2025

From start to finish, our wedding experience at this venue was absolutely amazing. The staff was so helpful throughout the planning process, always responsive and truly invested in making our vision come to life. Our day of coordinator Jennifer was outstanding! She was literally running around to make sure everything went smoothly. Her energy and attention to detail made the day so much less stressful for me I couldn’t have asked for a better coordinator. The space was clean, beautifully maintained, and they did an amazing job setting up all of my decorations exactly how I imagined. The food was delicious, and we received so many compliments from our guests. We’re so thankful for the entire team who helped make our day unforgettable. Highly recommend this venue to any couple looking for a beautiful space with a dedicated staff! – Nakiya & Robert Valdez
