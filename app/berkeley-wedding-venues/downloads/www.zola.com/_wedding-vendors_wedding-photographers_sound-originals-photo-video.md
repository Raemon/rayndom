We absolutely loved our photos and our photographer, Anthony, was the sweetest. He made sure we got what we wanted! Thank you!

  * ### Couldn’t have asked for a better videographer 

•Verified review

•Phung P.•Jan 5, 2026

Our videographer, Jonathan, was professional and meticulous. He paid great attention to our requests and what we wanted for our video. We also had the flexibility to choose a song from a large platform, which made the video feel more personal. As a bonus, Jonathan has an amazing voice and even sang us a song during our karaoke session, which was a fun and memorable touch. One thing to note is that the original package does not include revisions, so a few scenes we felt less satisfied with were included in the final video. Overall, we appreciated Jonathan and the Originals team’s dedication and creativity, and the experience was a positive one.

  * ### Great Wedding Photography for a good price!

•Verified review

•Chris and N.•Jan 3, 2026

Our Original Weddings team in Georgia was great! All of them were very nice and seemed like they were enjoying capturing our special day. They captured so much of our wedding including many little moments and did a great job at being there but not taking up space. It never felt like they were in the way and they were great at directing us in moments we needed them to. We opted for the 4-12 weeks delivery and they delivered within 4 weeks on Christmas day which was a nice present! Overall was a great time with them and we are very happy with the photos and videos!

  * ### HIGHEST value wedding photography we could find!

•Verified review

•Stephen K.•Dec 29, 2025

I would describe our experience with Original Weddings Chicago photography as extremely high-value and a strong contributor to the joy and seamlessness of our wedding day. For our Wisconsin wedding, 7 hours and two photographers (their mid-tier package) was competitively priced and impressively executed; for our event, there could have been no better fit than photography from Original Weddings. From start to finish, our expectations were completely exceeded in every dimension by our assigned photographers, Shawn and Brock, who were easy and fun to work with, captured every moment incredibly, and seamlessly integrated their presence and work into the fabric of our event. They truly made the day about US and our story, and it was such a pleasure to feel in total control yet unstressed and effortlessly supported. They were extremely courteous, knowledgeable, and thorough in their presence and direction throughout the day, and our wedding gallery turned out in the exact style and to the highest caliber we hoped for (and at a price point that was truly ideal for us). The booking process, communication chain, and pre-wedding meeting(s) were among the easiest and most seamless we had with any of our vendors, and we appreciate how comprehensive their services and offerings were while keeping things simple and easy to parse for us as the couple. The number of hours and the level of talent we received from Original Weddings (particularly from Shawn and Brock as our photographers) were nothing short of perfect for us, and there is an excellent chance that it will be perfect for your wedding too. My wife and I are so grateful for every moment we got to work with this company and overjoyed with every result thereof, and if you’re planning your wedding, we encourage you to strongly consider Original Weddings, particularly if you have the chance to work with Shawn and/or Brock as your photographers. Stephen & Ciara
