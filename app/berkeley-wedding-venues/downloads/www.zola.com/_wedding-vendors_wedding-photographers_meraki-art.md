  * ### Beautiful photos and an incredible person

•Verified review

•Judith E.•Nov 28, 2025

We were blown away by Shuhan and her sincere enthusiasm for us and our wedding. She made the whole process so simple and adapted to our situation. I think most couples are more organized than we were, but she was able to go with the flow and fit right in. She’s so easy to talk to and friendly, that we were all completely relaxed with her and had such a nice time. The photos are incredible and some of the candid shots are our favourites from the wedding. I cannot speak highly enough of her and her work.

Response from vendor•Dec 1, 2025

Thank you so much, Jude, for your incredibly kind words. They truly gave my whole 2025 the perfect wrap-up. One of the reasons I love photographing weddings is the warmth and joy that everyone brings to the day, and your family and friends were no exception. A special thank you to your parents as well — I hope they had a wonderful trip here. Wishing you a lifetime of happiness and a beautiful marriage.

  * ### The Perfect Choice for Our Wedding Photos

•Verified review

•Leonardo•Sep 16, 2025

We couldn’t be happier with Meraki! From the very first contact to the final gallery, everything felt so natural and effortless. They captured every emotion of our wedding day without ever making us feel staged or rushed. The photos are breathtaking and somehow feel exactly like us. Beyond the incredible images, the whole experience was fun like having a friend with a camera who just happened to be insanely talented. Thank you, Meraki, for giving us memories we’ll cherish forever.

Response from vendor•Sep 17, 2025

That’s exactly what I aimed for, and it means the world to hear that from you! Thank you so much for choosing me to be part of your day—your words truly made my day and mean so much to me. I’m so grateful I could capture these memories for you to cherish forever. Wishing you both all the happiness in this new chapter together!

  * ### Great last minute help!

•Verified review

•Alex S.•Jun 30, 2025

We hired Meraki Art as our last minute wedding ceremony videographer and to set up a live stream of the event. We were very happy with results. Shuhan communicated regularly online and on the phone, which made the process very smooth. This was a last minute request for help to stream our wedding ceremony for guests overseas that could not attend the event. Shuhan was responsive, easy to work with, and truly helped make our special day perfect. We highly recommend her!

  * ### My new go-to Photographer 

•Verified review

•Irene & C.•Aug 26, 2024

Shuhan is an energetic, personable, and comforting photographer! It was looking as if we weren't going to be able to find a photographer that fit our wedding budget and needs, but by a stroke of luck, we found Shuhan! She is so kind and easy-going. She made me feel pretty even though I felt so awkward. She is awesome at hyping you up and making you feel special! We had a great mix of candid photos and stylized photos. Communication was great and she was open to hearing our ideas as well. Turn around time for the photos was good. Overall, the photography session felt collaborative and that's our style. You won't go wrong with Shuhan as your photographer!

## Frequently asked questions

9 Answers

Ask them a question

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible about my availability, even if you’re planning on a shorter time frame. Especially those that require travel. But please don't be held back by this, feel free to contact me even if it's close to the date. I know plans change, I'm always happy to help.

### Do you work with assistants or other photographers?

Currently just me. But I can bring another photographer or assistant if you require. But the price will be different accordingly.

### Do you also offer video services?

No, since I'm on my own now. I have to focus on the photography first. I may expand the service later when I have a team.

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

The turnaround time is around 3-4 weeks.

### How many pictures will we get?

You can expect at least 80 to 100 images per hour of photographing. But keep in mind this estimate varies depending on your wedding package, number of guests, venue type, and other factors. And for each shooting hour, you can get 10 retouched photos and the rest with a filter on as results.

### What’s your back-up plan if you can’t photograph our wedding as planned?

I do whatever it takes to make sure I show up on time. Not only I know that this is your important moment, but also I value my business. I typically leave a day in advance and stay nearby to ensure that, no matter what happens, I'm close by.

### What's your style in directing poses?

I would ask what's your preference, if directing more would make you feel more reliable I can do that. Some people prefer to be themselves, I don't mind either. This is a major topic that I will discuss thoroughly before the wedding, to make sure I can serve the clients the way they prefer the best.

### What are raw files? Can I have them?

Raw files are the original files that contain more data to process in software. You can definitely have them, it's just the raw file can't be opened by regular media check apps. It can only be viewed inside a professional photo process app, such as Lightroom, Photoshop, etc.

### Can I see your past photos?

Yes! You can find them here: https://pin.it/2dWwkyCwp
