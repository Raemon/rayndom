  * ### Wedding Content Creator You Didn’t Know You Needed

•Verified review

•Kaylee D.•Jun 20, 2025

Kathlena from To Have & Hold is nothing short of magical. She has an incredible eye for detail and a gift for capturing the moments you didn’t even realize would mean so much until you saw them again. The reels she created for my wedding were beyond anything I could have imagined. She truly brought all my TikTok and Instagram dreams to life! She curated the most stunning content that felt so us, and I loved how candid, romantic, and joyful they were. Her editing style is clean, modern, and tailored perfectly for social media. She manages to take just a few seconds of video or a simple glance between people and turn it into something that makes you feel everything all over again — the love, the laughter, even the happy tears. Kathlena was also such a calming and positive presence throughout the day. She was very professional, warm, and incredibly easy to work with. She blended in so effortlessly while still managing to get the best behind-the-scenes footage. If you’re looking for someone who can bring your wedding day back to life in a way that feels emotional, cinematic, and completely personal, look no further. Kathlena doesn’t just create videos, she tells love stories. And I am forever grateful for how she told ours.

  * ### Best decision! 

•Verified review

•Kim•Jun 4, 2025

I’m so glad I chose To Have and Hold Content instead of a traditional videographer! Their incredible artsy eye brought a fresh, creative perspective that made every moment feel like a beautiful work of art. The way they captured our day was unique and truly special—far beyond just typical video footage. If you want your memories preserved with style, emotion, and an artistic touch, To Have and Hold Content is absolutely the way to go. Highly recommend!

To Have and Hold Content Creation was an absolute pleasure to work with for our wedding. Their communication was excellent - they were always quick to respond to our questions and kept us informed every step of the way. The quality of their work was also superb. They provided us with very detailed and informative content that was beautifully crafted. Their attention to detail really shone through and helped make our special day that much more memorable.

  * ### The Magic Behind the Moments

•Verified review

•Tiff M.•May 29, 2025

Working with To Have and To Hold Co was an absolute dream. From the very beginning, their ability to capture the essence of each moment — both the grand and the intimate — completely blew us away. Every video they create feels like a page out of a fairytale, beautifully curated yet authentically emotional. Their eye for detail is unmatched. From stunning venue shots and elegant floral arrangements to the candid joy of family and friends, everything is captured with such grace and warmth. It’s clear that they don’t just document events. They tell a story, your story, in the most artful and heartfelt way. We couldn’t be happier with the way they brought our vision to life. If you’re looking for someone who can make your memories feel timeless and magical, look no further than To Have and To Hold Co. They truly go above and beyond.
