  * ### What a GREAT experience!

•Verified review

•Pilar G.•Sep 27, 2025

I hired Roseanne Noyce and her team for a corporate event that started with 150 attendees and grew to over 300! Roseanne and her team were professional, a joy to work with, and delivered an exceptional product. The hats are top quality—better than most—and I wear mine all the time for style, shade, and protection. It’s truly become part of me. As Head of Events for a tech company, the biggest complaint I heard after the event was: “Why didn’t everyone get a hat?” That one’s on me… next time, I’m ordering more!

  * ### Five stars!! 

•Verified review

•Rhonda•Sep 24, 2025

If you're looking for a unique, personalized experience and a one-of-a-kind custom hat, Rose & Co Hat Bar is where it’s at and Roseanne, the owner, is truly something special. She came right to us, bringing the full hat bar experience with her and I can honestly say it was one of the best experiences I’ve had. From the moment she arrived, Roseanne made everything feel easy, creative, and fun. She’s not only incredibly talented, but also one of the most genuine people you’ll ever meet. She guided us through every step of the design process from hat styles and colors to trims and embellishments making it exciting and effortless. My friends and I each created custom hats that we absolutely love!! It's rare to find something that feels so personal. Roseanne nailed it for every one of us.

  * ### Rose & Co Made My Birthday Unforgettable

•Verified review

•Linnea•Sep 20, 2025

Rose & Co Hat Bar made my birthday absolutely unforgettable! The custom cowboy hats were incredible, true works of art with attention to detail I never could have imagined. Their service and communication were beyond amazing, and they added the perfect personal touches to each hat that made the whole experience so special. Everyone kept saying it was the best experience, and I couldn’t agree more. Not only do we now have hats that will last a lifetime, but we also created memories to go along with them. Nothing but good things to say, highly recommend!

  * ### A night to remember with Rose and Co Hat Bar

•Verified review

•Jamie D.•Aug 13, 2025

From start to finish, everything was beautifully curated and so much fun. The owner of Rose and Co Hat Bar was not only incredibly talented and creative, but also warm, professional, and made everyone feel at ease. She brought an amazing selection of materials — think rhinestones, feathers, fringe, charms, and so many unique touches — and helped guide us through customizing our own one-of-a-kind cowboy hats. She was amazing and made for an amazing night!
