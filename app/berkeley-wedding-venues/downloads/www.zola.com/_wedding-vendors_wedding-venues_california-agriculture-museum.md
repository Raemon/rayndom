## About this venue

The museum and event center is a cultural destination ideal for your next business conference, meeting, festival, or your family event that highlights the next rite of passage: weddings, sweet sixteen, quinceañeras , birthdays, anniversaries, and celebrations of life. With three unique spaces, the museum encourages events that support its mission to protect, preserve, and educate in an environment of early California artifacts. Wander through the lush courtyard, meet in the banquet hall, and to trip into history in our expansive galleries. Parking is not an obstacle for your next visit.
