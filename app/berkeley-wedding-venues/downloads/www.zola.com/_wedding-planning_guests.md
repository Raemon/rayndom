### FAQ

  * #### We have no one’s addresses! Can we collect a ton at once?

You bet! You can text or email our handy form, or let us message your family and friends (even your parents) for you. Then we’ll update your guest list with their info, making it easy for you to make sure everyone you want is invited.

  * #### How do I know if I should invite someone to my wedding?

Figuring out your number of guests can be a challenge (especially when parents start inviting their friends!). We recommend our sorting features to vet different headcounts. Mark people as bride’s or groom’s side and more. Our "Definitely" and "Maybe" filters help, too.

  * #### What if people change their RSVP?

Don’t sweat it! You two can manually edit guests’ RSVPs anytime you want.

  * #### Can I print my guest list on Zola?

Yup! You can download all your invited guests as a spreadsheet and print it for your wedding venue and vendors.

  * #### Wait, how is Zola’s guest list manager free?

We make money by selling wedding gifts and stationery through our store. Don’t want to register at Zola or use our wedding paper? Our guest list manager is still 100% free to use.

  * #### When should I start building my wedding guest list?

The earlier the better! Once you have a budget hammered out, build your guest list accordingly and let it dictate your venue options and overall wedding vibe. Intimate? Royal? We love it all.

  * #### What should we include in our wedding guest list?

A wedding guest list includes the full names of the friends and family you’d like to invite, as well as important guest info like mailing addresses, emails, and phone numbers. We find that most couples choose to track their guest list and RSVPs in one convenient place, like a spreadsheet. Looking for a wedding guest list template? Our free guest list manager will do all the heavy lifting for you, from collecting addresses to tracking RSVPs, meal choices, even song requests from everyone (plus ones and children, too!). And if you go with our save the dates, invitations, and thank you cards, we’ll print those addresses on your envelopes for free! It’s one magical tool.

  * #### How do we create our wedding guest list?

To get started, jot down every name that comes to mind to get an idea of how many people you’d like to invite. We recommend asking your families whether they’d like to add some names, too. There’s no promise that you have to invite their chosen guests, but it’s a nice gesture to take their suggestions into consideration. Then work with your partner (and anyone you’d like to be involved) to whittle down your list, using your budget as a guide. Overwhelmed or short on time? Our free guest list manager can handle everything from collecting missing addresses to thank you card writing. Just add guests to the tool right from your phone’s address book, type names and numbers directly in, or upload an existing spreadsheet. Then you (or we) can text/email a link to a form where your guests can fill out their info. Like magic, your guest list will automatically update! For more, read our Expert Advice article. 

  * #### What if we’re missing some guests’ information?

Don’t sweat it! Our free guest list manager can take care of address wrangling for you. You can text or email guests a quick link to our handy form, or let us message your family and friends (even your parents) for you. Then we’ll update your wedding guest list with their info, making it easy for you to make sure everyone you want is invited. Need addressing help, too? We’ll format all your guests’ addresses for you and print them on your envelopes for free if you go with our save the dates, invitations, and thank you cards.

  * #### Do we have to address our envelopes by hand?

Nope! We did all the addressing etiquette research for you and will formally lay out all your guests’ addresses for you. You can easily export a spreadsheet of everyone invited for your calligrapher or paper supplier. Or get free guest addressing when you create your save the dates, invitations, and thank you cards at Zola. Just add guests’ info to our free guest list manager, and we’ll take care of the rest. It’s a lifesaver for those who have messy handwriting (or are prone to hand cramps). 

  * #### How can we keep track of all our guests?

We recommend creating your wedding guest list and tracking RSVPs in a spreadsheet, so you have everything you need in one convenient place. If you’re collecting physical RSVP cards, simply add a column next to all your guests’ names, then note their response. Want to save time? Create a free wedding website at Zola, and let guests RSVP to multiple wedding events right on your site. Your free guest list manager will track RSVPs from everyone (plus ones and children, too!) and even meal choices and song requests. You can also use our magical tool to send RSVP reminders anytime, or message guests updates about everything from hotel blocks to weather.
