Hi! I'm Anna the founder and senior photographer of Hey Honey Photography. I am a Texas-born, California girl at heart. I reside in the San Francisco Bay Area, and have a team of talented wedding photographers with a passion for capturing your life’s biggest moments and all your candid in betweens. Choosing a wedding photographer is more than just hiring someone with a camera to document your day. They should be someone who inspires you, helps ease wedding day jitters, and is your biggest fan, empowering you to be in the moment, while capturing what you want to remember forever, with creativity, boldness, and authenticity.

We specialize in creating timeless, nostalgic, editorial-inspired, documentary style wedding photography that uniquely tells your story! My background in psychology and creative project management ultimately led me to a desire to help you be camera-confident and be freed up to enjoy every moment of your big day. I believe that understanding your vision and getting to know you on a personal level is the key to capturing your story in the most meaningful way. Our clients rave about how we make them feel comfortable, confident, and beautiful on camera, and it would be our joy to document your family legacy!

  * ### HeyHoney is the best!!!

•Verified review

•Leila S.•Dec 19, 2024

From the moment we first spoke with Anna from Hey Honey Photography, we knew we were in good hands. Her communication was clear, professional, and intentional, putting us at ease throughout the planning process. The quality of her work is truly unique, relatable, and reassuring - Anna has an incredible talent for capturing the special details and moments that make each wedding day so special and personal. As a planner, her expertise and flexibility were incredible valuable; she checked in regularly to ensure everything was on point, and brought such great energy and enthusiasm that kept the day fun and enjoyable for us and our guests. It was a pleasure to bounce ideas around with Anna and leverage her background to help give our wedding day the perfect structure. We felt completely taken care of and confident that our memories would be beautifully preserved. We're thrilled with the results and can't recommend Hey Honey Photography highly enough!

  * ### Best Photographer I Could've Asked For

•Verified review

•Kaitie G.•Dec 18, 2024

Anna and her extra photographer (so sorry I've forgotten her name) were both amazing for our wedding. I had multiple guests comment on how Anna never missed a moment, and now that we've received our gallery, we couldn't agree more. They did such a fantastic job. Thank you so much!

Response from vendor•Jan 8, 2025

Thank you so much Katie! We absolutely loved being a part of your day!

  * ### The best of the best! 

•Verified review

•Jewel M.•Nov 29, 2024

Working with Anna was one of the best decisions we made during our wedding planning. Not only is she talented and allows you to have the most beautiful photos of your special day, she is very on top of things and always willing to lend a helping hand during your wedding planning if you need it. Anna makes photoshoots feel very natural and comfortable, especially if you’re not used to that sort of thing! I would recommend Hey Honey Photography if you want the most beautiful memories of a special time in your life, you absolute will NOT regret it. 10/10 stars!

Response from vendor•Jan 8, 2025

Thank you Jewel! Your wedding was so much fun and we had a blast capturing it!

  * ### Absolutely Amazing

•Verified review

•Cory R.•Nov 21, 2024

From the moment we started planning our wedding, Anna and the team at Hey Honey Photography were an absolute joy to work with. She was an excellent communicator even through COVID and our wedding date shifting multiple times. We could not be happier with our wedding photos, we are absolutely obsessed! All of our images came out so beautiful, Anna captured the day even better than we imagined. She not only photographed every detail, she also surprised us with a very sweet card and a sneak peek of our photos with some beautiful polaroids she took that brought us to tears. We absolutely loved working with Anna, she was very professional, sweet, and her work is amazing. We also used her services for our engagement photos and they came out beautifully as well. We highly recommend Hey Honey Photography!

Response from vendor•Jan 8, 2025

Thank you so much Cory!! Your wedding was such a dream and we just loved being a part of your celebration!

## Frequently asked questions

8 Answers

Ask them a question

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically, couples book me about 6-18 months before their wedding date. I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible about my availability, even if you’re planning on a shorter time frame.

### Do you work with assistants or other photographers?

Sometimes, I’ll bring one or more assistant photographers depending on the size of your wedding. Don’t worry, this won’t cost you extra.

### Will you edit all our pictures?

Definitely. All final images will be edited for color, saturation, exposure, and sharpness to ensure they look beautiful. I also offer retouching services like blemish removal and teeth whitening for an additional charge.

### Do you also offer video services?

No, I prefer focusing on photography only, so you can get the best wedding pictures possible. I do however, work with several talented videographers that I'd be happy to refer you to!

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

My turnaround time varies by season. Typically, you’ll be able to view your photos online about 4-6 weeks after your wedding. Within this time, you can also expect to receive an online digital gallery with high-resolution image files, so you can share the photos with your loved ones and order prints.

### How many pictures will we get?

You can expect about 40 to 80 images per hour of photographing. But keep in mind this estimate varies depending on your wedding package, number of guests, venue type, and other factors.

### Do you have insurance?

I do! Just let me know if your venue requires a certificate of liability, and I’ll send that over to them.

### What’s your back-up plan if you can’t photograph our wedding as planned?

In my 3 years of experience as a wedding photographer, I’ve never cancelled a booking. In the very rare event that I’m unable to photograph your wedding, I’ll make sure you’re covered by one of my colleagues or my contracted assistant. I’ll also provide you with a list of photographers from the many networking groups I’m in, so you can find the perfect replacement.
