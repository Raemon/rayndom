Hello! Whether you're seeking a content creator to capture the behind the scene moments on your big day or a photographer for your couples shoot, I am your person! I aim to capture all the details that are typically missed. Please note I am not a wedding photographer unless it's a private ceremony or guest count of under 50.

My style involves a lot of candid shots that lets your love story shine the brightest. I love to shoot very cinematic and ethereal vibey shots. I'm able to deliver wedding content (raw footage and reels that I create) within 24 hours after the event has ended so you have it in time to post on your socials!

  * ### Lovely Engagement Shoot

•Verified review

•Cynthia•Oct 17, 2024

I recently worked with Kathy for an engagement photoshoot at SF City Hall. She was incredibly flexible when we arrived late, which we really appreciated. She took the time to capture a wide variety of shots around the area, and her friendly demeanor made the experience enjoyable. She also provided helpful directions during the shoot, making it a fun outing overall. Thank you for your hard work! (Added my favorite photo. I like the motion of it which is quite apt given we were dancing, and the lighting is romantically moody.)

•Verified review

•Yumei H.•Oct 14, 2024

From the first time we spoke with Kathy, we knew we were in good hands. Their communication style was open, friendly and easy to share ideas. They were extremely attentive, understanding and really tried to bring our vision to life. Kathy listened intently to what I wanted and shared creative ideas with me. She expertly directed us through various poses and made us feel completely comfortable in front of the camera. The quality of their work and the value they provided was outstanding. We are thrilled with how our photos turned out and would highly recommend Posh Narratives to any couple looking for a talented, professional and personable photography team.

•Verified review

•James Y.•Oct 14, 2024

Kathy was the perfect choice for our engagement shoot. From our very first interaction, her communication was clear, understanding, and made us feel completely comfortable. The quality of her work was meticulous - she truly captured the mood and essence of our special bond. She expertly directed our poses, ensuring that my fiancé and I felt natural and at ease in front of the camera. The final photos were amazing and perfectly encapsulated our charm and love. We are thrilled with the results and would 100% refer using Posh Narratives to our friends and family.

•Christina T.•Oct 14, 2024

Kathy was our wedding content creator and created some awesome reels for us! She actually sent them to us that very evening! Love that she was able to do a quick turnaround and capture some key moments for us to get a sneak peek right after our wedding. Highly recommend!
