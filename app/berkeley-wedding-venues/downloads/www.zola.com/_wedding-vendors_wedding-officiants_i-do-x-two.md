I love working with couples to write a ceremony that is authentic to their love story and with all the details they envision. I've officiated estate-sized wine country weddings and those at the Ritz; to ceremonies in art galleries and country clubs, to shoreline and backyard elopements, and vow renewals at a family picnic or a restaurant--each one just as special as the other.

Experience and a truly customized ceremony are two factors that set me apart. I got my start as an Alameda County Deputy Marriage Commissioner then went out on my own, serving as an Officiant/Celebrant for nearly 12 years.

**In three words:** Collaborative, Confident, Positive

  * ### Amazing Officiant for any Wedding

•Verified review

•Omar Q.•Jan 11

Saundra is a professional and easy to work with. She really knew how to make our ceremony extra special. From her coordination and help during the rehearsal she made the ceremony go forward smoothly. She was also very communicative and helpful in filing the final marriage license. I would recommend Saundra to any couple getting married in the Bay Area.

  * ### The Best!

•Verified review

•Kiana•Aug 7, 2025

Saundra at I Do X Two was the perfect wedding officiant for our special day. From our very first interaction, she was personable, sweet, and attentive, making the process of getting married feel intimate, easy, and efficient. Saundra made it so easy for me to not worry about a thing - she handled all of the details with professionalism and care, allowing my husband and I to simply enjoy the moment. I would highly recommend I Do X Two to any couple looking for a warm, experienced professional to officiate their wedding.

  * ### Saundra is the best Officiant EVER!

•Verified review

•Tara W.•Jul 8, 2025

I just had my wedding on July 5th and used I Do X Two’s services, with Saundra as our officiant. From the beginning, she took extensive time and care to craft a personalized ceremony that reflected both me and my now-husband perfectly. Saundra met with us beforehand to hear our love story and get to know us both individually and as a couple. She made sure our voices were heard and that our wishes for the ceremony were thoughtfully incorporated. I consider myself spiritual but not religious, while my husband was raised in a religious family and has his own way of practicing it. Saundra reassured us that despite our differences, she would be able to blend both of our beliefs into a ceremony that honored us equally—and she absolutely delivered. My husband also shared some of his concerns with Saundra, including potential areas of conflict, and she responded with understanding and grace, sharing how she’s helped other couples navigate similar situations. When the big day arrived, Saundra was incredible. She led the ceremony with such beauty, calm, and confidence—it flowed seamlessly. She was organized, warm, and extremely helpful throughout the entire process. She even offered to print our vows on the most gorgeous cardstock and supported us with the ceremony’s flow to ensure everything went perfectly. After the ceremony, Saundra took care of our marriage license, ensuring everything was completed and submitted properly. Our guests and both of our families couldn’t stop raving about how beautiful the ceremony was and how wonderful Saundra made it feel. All this to say: choose I Do X Two. You’ll have a stunning ceremony, guests who are moved and impressed, and hearts that are full! Thank you so much Saundra!

## Frequently asked questions

4 Answers

Ask them a question

### Can we personalize our ceremony?

Absolutely! I specialize in working with couples to create a ceremony unique to your wishes! Whether your doggie is your ring-bearer, you want a sibling to read a poem, your guests to bless your rings, know that there are so many, many different ways to celebrate your love and have it evidenced in your ceremony!

### Rehearsal needed? yes or no?

My recommendation is that if you have a bridal party that is 6 or more, a rehearsal is a good idea. Facilitating a rehearsal is an extra fee, the exact price depends on whether or not it will require travelling in commute traffic.

### We’re legally married already. Can you still officiate our ceremony?

Yes indeed! While you're legally married, what's likely missing is the celebration of your committed love with family and friends! In these cases, my role would be more of a "celebrant" than an "officiant". Together, we'll exchange ideas and design a ceremony that celebrates your love!

### When did you get your start?

Over a decade ago, I got my start as a sworn-in Deputy Marriage Commissioner for Alameda County. A year after serving in that capacity, I hung my own shingle and began creating custom ceremonies for my clients. I've married couples who reside in the Bay Area and throughout California. I've also married couples who came to SF as their chosen wedding destination and, still other couples, who have come from England, Ireland, Japan and France to be married here before flying off to their respective honeymoon destinations. I've also worked with interpreters to facilitate multi-lingual ceremonies--the language of love is universal.
