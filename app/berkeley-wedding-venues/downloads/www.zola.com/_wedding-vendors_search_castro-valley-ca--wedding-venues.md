The space itself was truly breathtaking, with its amazing new upgrades and beautiful views. However, there were a few details that weren't properly communicated to us, which led to a bit of a rocky start. Although my bridal party and I had lots to deal with prior to ceremony start, these issues were not something our guests would have seen/noticed. To their credit, the Wedgewood team acknowledged their mistakes and upgraded our bar package to make up for it. Overall, the venue was beautiful and the staff did their best to ensure our day went smoothly, despite the initial hiccups. We would recommend San Ramon Waters to other couples looking for a gorgeous wedding location.”Gabriella G., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/09e08c08-a991-4f46-8f27-5f0c08b2944c?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/san-ramon-by-wedgewood-weddings)

“We had a wonderful wedding - the Wedgewood team helped us create a meaningful ceremony and reception. The pictures online do not do this place justice - you have to see it for yourself! The grounds are beautiful; we had our ceremony at the pavilion and our reception in the garden area / in their indoor hall area. The venue definitely felt like a fairy / cottage core dream to me! Wedgewood also vendors that work with them and provide really excellent services - florals, music, cakes. If you want to have an awesome wedding and reduce your stress, I would check this place out.”Rachael A., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/hacienda-de-las-flores-by-wedgewood-weddings)

![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“My husband and I were engaged in October 2023 and began looking at wedding venues the month after. We then finalized our booking with Redwood Canyon in January 2024 to give ourselves ample time for planning and financing for our big day on May 26th, 2025. Since we live on the East Coast and majority of our families reside in the Bay Area, we wanted to find a venue that could provide an all-inclusive package and bring our vision to reality - and Redwood Canyon checked all of those boxes... even going above and beyond. We are very happy with the entire process that led up to our special day and the outcome of our wedding. *1 year prior to the wedding* They kept us updated with some of the renovations they were making at the time. When we wanted to do a physical tour in June 2024, they fitted us into the schedule and showed us the actual colors of table cloths, napkins, lighting, etc. *8 months prior to the wedding* The wedding team sent us an invitation to the Fall Wedding Extravaganza Fair for late October 2024. We unfortunately couldn't make it, but they accommodated us by including our friend couple residing in the Bay Area to take over our place. Our friend couple FaceTimed us during the entire event to make us feel like we were there! They commented how it was nice to try out all the food options they had in the package to know what foods the couple would like to finalize for their wedding day. They also enjoyed the fun activities the DJ curated - there were two opportunities to win a prize from those activities. *5 months prior to the wedding* This was a two-hour call with the wedding team to go over our vision and details. I forgot the name of the person assisting us, but she was very patient and fun to talk with! She reassured us that if there were changes we'd like to make over the next few months, they'd be happy to accommodate. A few months later, vendors contacted us to further discuss additional details - officiant, cake, DJ, and florist. *1 week prior to the wedding* We had Jacoby as our amazing wedding coordinator and Ana to assist on our special day. They reviewed and confirmed details as well as what to expect on our Rehearsal Day, which was a day prior to our wedding. We loved their positive attitudes and professionalism throughout the process! *Wedding Day* Despite how fast and chaotic it felt, we truly appreciate Jacoby and Ana for keeping us on the right pace, consistently checking in with us, and making sure we were happy and comfortable throughout the day. If there was something I, my husband, our wedding party, and family needed, they were quick to provide it. They also knew where to put our decor and took some behind-the-scenes photos to share with us after our wedding. We had our photographer, Hayden from A Perfect Impression, who suggested all the right poses, shots, angles, and places to take our photos. Our DJ, Saul, was very accommodating with a song request and some changes that we communicated through email and text - the vibe of the ceremony and reception was perfect. The food was fantastic, the photobooth provided high-quality images that we could receive through a texted link. *Overall* If we could rate it more than 5 stars, we totally would!

![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We just had our wedding at Sequoyah this past weekend. Everything was perfect. The venue itself is stunning. It is such a beautiful setting for a wedding. We had our ceremony on the lawn and the reception inside. We spent the day getting ready on site and my entire bridal party kept commenting on how nice everything was. My dream was to get married amongst the redwoods and I cannot wait to see the photos from the day. The food was next level. When I say the food was delicious, I don't mean "for a wedding". We had many guests compliment the food. I have a friend who is an admitted "steak snob". She made sure I knew how good the filet was. Finally, the entire staff was wonderful to work with. We originally met with Andrea who showed us the venue. She was a big reason we chose Sequoyah. Andrea and Sally were helpful and flexible throughout the planning process. They were very responsive and made the process as easy as it could be. We hired a month-of coordinator who agreed they were wonderful. I would also like to mention Emma, who was so thoughtful and kind throughout the evening. After the wedding, I mentioned some of the nice things Emma did to my family and bridal party. Others had similar stories. She truly went above-and-beyond. I cannot recommend Sequoyah enough. They gave me the perfect wedding experience!”Kristi & C., 3 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/sequoyah-country-club)

For starters Angela Muse helped us from start to finish on planning our day and every little detail in between! She was amazing to work with, she was clear, communicative, friendly and organized which is everything you want when you are planning your wedding! When I arrived at my reception I was blown away by the decor and how beautiful every detail was! Thank you so much Angela for all of your hard work and support in making my dream reception!!! The vendors that are connected to Fairview that I opted into having was DJ Keel and Ting at Montclair Florist. DJ Keel was a phenomenal MC and met with us ahead of time to get an idea of how we wanted our wedding MC'd as well as what we wanted our music to be like and let me tell you he achieved it!!! My guests were laughing, entertained and raving about the music all night! Thank you Dj Keel! I coordinated with Ting from Montclair Florist and although we did not talk much I have to say my bouquet and center pieces were the most beautiful flower arrangements I have ever seen! The flowers were stunning and she ran with the ideas I had and made it the most beautiful arrangement ever!! My guests were raving about the food and we were so supported by KeeKee our Banquet Manager! She checked in on us and made sure we were good throughout our reception! Book with Fairview you will not regret it the venue is beautiful and open, the tented pavilion is gorgeous, the food is delicious and the staff are phenomenal!!!

## About wedding venues in Castro Valley, CA

### 

California offers an incredible 840 miles of coastline, 3,000+ wineries and ancient redwoods for your wedding day. When you choose the Golden State, you're getting exceptional natural lighting for your ceremony across diverse settings from Mediterranean coastal zones to alpine mountain backdrops. Each region has its own distinctive character that can perfectly match your vision.

### What Makes California Wedding Venues So Special?

Northern California's Napa Valley welcomes you with rolling vineyards and Spanish colonial architecture where intimate wine cave ceremonies create unforgettable moments. Head to Southern California and you'll find oceanfront venues like Duke's Malibu where you can exchange vows with the Pacific stretching out behind you while enjoying fresh coastal-inspired cuisine. Palm Springs offers dramatic desert venues with mountain backdrops and striking midcentury modern architecture that photographs beautifully.

### How Much Do Wedding Venues in California Cost?

Wedding venues in California typically run between $9,600 and $11,700 which aligns nicely with the national range of $6,500-$12,000. This represents about 18% of your total wedding budget. Your overall costs will vary based on guest count:
