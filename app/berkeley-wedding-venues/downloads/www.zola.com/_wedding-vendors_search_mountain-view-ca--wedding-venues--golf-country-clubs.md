![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“From the moment we started planning our wedding at The Ranch at Silver Creek by Wedgewood Weddings, the staff was incredibly attentive, responsive, and open to collaborating with us. Their expertise and knowledge of the venue and the wedding planning process took a lot of the stress off of us. The property itself is absolutely beautiful, with multiple areas that allowed us to get creative and make the space our own. On the day of the wedding, the staff kept us informed about the windy weather and offered helpful suggestions, ensuring everything ran smoothly. I would highly recommend this Wedgewood Weddings location to anyone looking for a stunning venue with an amazing team to support them through the entire wedding planning journey.”Jamie & B., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/52ef72b4-ba1d-4461-8956-37c56e0a8a5a?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-ranch-at-silver-creek-by-wedgewood-weddings)

“We had a wonderful experience working with the Saratoga Country Club for our wedding. From the very beginning and throughout the whole process, the event planner Sherry was always quick to respond and helpful with answering all my questions. The Country Club recently repainted and re-carpeted their reception room, and it looks so good! They had an event earlier in the day before our wedding, so I was super worried they wouldn't be able to set everything up quickly enough, but they did an amazing job! I had a minute to see the reception room before the ceremony, and they had arranged and decorated everything exactly how I had specified. The day-of reception coordinator, Mara, was also wonderful. She was super attentive and helpful, even checking on our parents multiple times throughout the evening to make sure they were happy. Would definitely recommend this venue for a South Bay wedding!”Abigail R., a year ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/saratoga-country-club)
