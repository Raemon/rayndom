liliRose Bakery inc 5.0 Roseville, CA


I’m a Cake Decorators. A world without custom cakes would lack sweetness and celebration, as each creation brings joy, love, and artistry to life’s most special moments. My cake designs blend elegance and creativity, inspired by the beauty of celebrations and the joy of each occasion. I use color, texture, and unique themes to bring your vision to life, making every wedding and birthday unforgettable.“Working with LiliRose Bakery for our wedding cake was truly exceptional. From the first conversation, they were attentive, patient, and eager to bring our vision to life. We shared a few inspiration photos, and they beautifully transformed the idea into a luxury cake beyond anything we imagined. The design was elegant, clean, and refined — every detail looked flawless. It wasn’t just a cake, it was a centerpiece that had all our guests talking and taking photos before even tasting it! And the flavor… incredible. Moist, rich, and perfectly balanced — you could immediately taste the quality and craftsmanship. Many of our guests came back for a second slice and asked where we ordered it from. The delivery was on time, professional, and stress-free, which really matters on a wedding day. What stood out the most was their passion and the care they put into every step. LiliRose Bakery made us feel valued, heard, and taken care of. We highly recommend them to any couple who wants a luxurious, delicious cake that looks as breathtaking as it tastes. We couldn’t be happier with our experience. Thank you for adding something so beautiful and memorable to our special day.”Sepehr, a month ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-cakes-desserts/lilirose-bakery-inc)

I never once felt like just another client—they treated me with care and attention, which gave me so much confidence leading up to the big day. The cake tasting was one of the highlights of wedding planning. Every flavor was delicious, but the almond cake with apricot filling completely stole the show—it was honestly the most incredible cake flavor I’ve ever tried. Palette Cakes made the experience fun and memorable, and it felt like they were just as invested in finding the perfect flavor combination as I was. On the wedding day, the cake was everything I had dreamed of and more. It was stunningly beautiful, decorated with intricate sugar flowers that perfectly complemented our florist’s arrangements. Guests couldn’t stop admiring it, and when we finally cut into it, the taste was just as divine as we remembered from the tasting. It was one of those rare moments where something looks too good to eat, but then tastes even better than it looks. What impressed me most was how Palette Cakes worked closely with me to ensure the cake fit within our budget without ever compromising on quality or artistry. They truly went above and beyond, and the final product exceeded every expectation I had. Their professionalism, creativity, and genuine care made the entire process seamless and joyful. I would wholeheartedly recommend them to any couple planning their wedding—you’ll not only get a cake that’s beautiful and delicious, but you’ll also gain a partner who makes you feel supported every step of the way.”Victoria D., 2 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/8f6cca7d-c841-41d9-9cf6-efaafbb5efb6?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-cakes-desserts/palette-cakes)

Custom Cakes by Tara 5.0

  * Starts at $6 
  * Serves Roseville, CA

It all started in 2010 with a dessert bar for my in-law's 40-year anniversary party. I became well known among my group of friends for my desserts. If there was a potluck, there was a request for me to bring the dessert! What started as a passion for baking small desserts turned into creating custom one-of-a-kind cakes when a friend asked me to make a cake for her baby shower. In 2019 I made Custom Cakes by Tara an official business with all the proper licenses to operate out of my home kitchen and in 2021, I decided to accept only wedding cake orders.“Custom Cakes by Tara was an absolute delight to work with for our wedding. Tara was extremely responsive, answering all of our questions in a timely and informative manner. The quality of their work was simply outstanding - the wedding cake and cupcakes they created for us were the best I've ever had. The cake was incredibly moist with a perfect light and whipped frosting that was just the right amount of sweetness. The flavor pairings were fantastic, and the prices were very reasonable. Tara followed our vision to a T, perfectly executing the color scheme we requested for the cake and cupcakes. The setup and on-time delivery were also flawless. I highly recommend Tara and Custom Cakes by Tara for your wedding dessert needs - she will not disappoint! Thank you for helping make our day absolutely amazing!”Allie H., 2 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/867d9076-8bab-43d7-b4fa-e2b2f16ca8ee?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-cakes-desserts/custom-cakes-by-tara)

Mochata is a home bakery located in Hercules, CA. Our passion lies in crafting exceptional baked mochi donuts and culturally-inspired horchatas. Every creation is meticulously prepared in-house, reflecting our unwavering commitment to quality. We take pride in our continuous exploration and refinement of flavors, with valuable input from our wonderful community. Your support has been instrumental in our journey, and we eagerly anticipate the opportunity to serve you. Thank you for being a part of our success, and we look forward to delighting your taste buds soon!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“I've enjoyed mochi donuts from other businesses but someone told me I had to try Mochata and I'm glad I took their word for it. Best mochi donuts hands down that I've had in a long time! I reached out to Erik to inquire about catering mini mochi donuts for my wedding in March 2024 and his customer service was on a whole other level. He was so personable and friendly that I just wanted to order just because of that (go small businesses go!). I asked if he had samples to try and he gladly made a batch and I ended up ordering 5 dozen mini donuts. Everyone at my wedding LOVED them. So much that I didn't even get to have any myself during reception! What stands out the most about Mochata's donuts is that the flavor is actually IN the donut itself. Not just the icing that we're all used to. And the texture? Exactly the way a mochi should taste. Flavors? ON POINT!! The toppings are very generous, especially the Cookies N Cream and Mint Oreo. My absolute favorites are Coconut Pandan, Ube and Strawberries N Cream and my husband always goes for the Mint Oreo. Now that it's post-wedding, I've been having cravings so I ordered more just for my family and I to enjoy. I haven't tried all the flavors yet but I have no doubt that they all taste delicious. I also recently got myself a Thai Horchata drink. I never thought about combining the two flavors together and it was super good! Now I feel like I need to try every flavor of that as well. Thank you Erik for being able to make my wedding day even more special! Definitely plan to be a regular customer for whenever I have a craving.”Phuong D., 2 years ago![](https://images.zola.com/a40fa37f-e12f-4d59-89d2-34e8d98f6c84?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-cakes-desserts/mochata-mochi-donuts-horchata)

Sf Candy Bar 5.0

  * Serves Roseville, CA

When I opened SF Candy Bar in 2012, the business was busy from the start. In 2012, the economy was just coming out of a recession and Silicon Valley started to attract top talent from all over the world. Experiential add on features, like our candy buffets, was fun at office parties, trade shows and holiday parties. Brides and Mitzvahs also found so much joy in our services. Fast forward to more than a decade later, we have added on more services from popcorn buffets, custom packaged party favors, and trail mix buffets. SF Candy Bar is dedicated to providing stunning buffet designs to guests at special events.“SF Candy Bar provided a candy buffet at our wedding, and it was a total hit! The display was vibrant and inviting, with a wide variety of candies that catered to every taste. From nostalgic favorites to gourmet selections, the spread was thoughtfully curated and beautifully arranged. Our guests, both young and old, couldn't get enough of the colorful array of treats. The setup was elegant and perfectly matched our wedding theme, adding a fun and playful touch to our special day. The team was professional, ensuring everything was flawlessly arranged and replenished throughout the evening. SF Candy Bar made our wedding reception extra sweet and memorable. We couldn’t have asked for a better candy buffet experience!!”Christine H., a year ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-cakes-desserts/sf-candy-bar)
