“This venue brought our wedding to life with the sweeping views and nothing but rolling hills as far as the eye could see. We had great locations across the property picked out for photos which was very important to us as we didn't get any engagement photos. The layout of the pavilion worked perfectly for our group, our families loved it. The live band and catering from their preferred vendor list were a hit. Mission Peak Wine made our special day magical. We are so thankful to remember our special day at their gorgeous venue.”Rodney & J., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/mission-peak-wine)

“Domenico Winery was the perfect venue for our wedding celebration. We struggled with finding a venue that was both close to where we lived, fit the number of guests we wanted while also fitting within our price range & the 'vibe' we were going for, but then in came Domenico (right under our noses!) From the very beginning, their communication was prompt, clear, and very open with any questions/customizations we wanted, which made the planning process seamless. They do require at a minimum a day of planner to help ensure the wedding day goes smoothly, and I'm so glad they did as between the venue coordination and wedding planner, I didn't have much to worry about the day of! The industrial, winery-inspired space had a modern and elegant feel that perfectly suited our vision. The staff went above and beyond to make us and our loved ones feel welcome and special, incorporating so many of the unique touches we wanted. The wedding food was amazing, we are still getting compliments from our family members about how Domenico's catering was some of the best wedding food they have ever had (chilean sea bass & short ribs were top hits)! Domenico's preferred vendors list was large & we found excellent vendors to work with (including our photographer & planner) through their recommendations. We were thrilled with how our wedding day turned out and are so grateful to the Domenico team (Karla, Aaron & everyone else!) for helping to make it an unforgettable experience. Would highly, highly recommend an event or wedding here, especially if you are SF Peninsula/Silicon Valley based and looking for a cool, local spot!”Courtney O., a year ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/domenico-winery)

“This review is long overdue. The staff was really amazing in coordinating our perfect wedding right from the beginning. We were planning our big day from out of state, which you would think would cause a few hiccups but the staff at J Winston Winery made everything very easy. Taylor Kinsey, Operations manager, was always quick to respond, provided great recommendations, had tremendous patience and was very professional throughout the entire process. They offered a package to buy out the winery at a very reasonable price so we didn’t have to worry about uninvited guests or rush any last minute details. The wine packages were just as reasonable; the only tough decision here was deciding which ones to serve. The newly built barn, where we hosted our reception was beautifully done. It had all the right touches with very little need for additional decorations. The day before the wedding we were able to setup/prep anything we needed to and of course enjoyed some of their amazing wine. We were really appreciative of them working closely with our multiple vendors prior to wedding day and getting them all set up on our special day. We can’t thank them enough for making our special day truly magical. We still visit the winery when we’re in town and to this day continue to thank them for the great job they did and reminiscence on the fun we had. Thank you John and the J Winston Winery team for being there for us especially Taylor and Leyla!”Brittany & G., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/2aa3d905-9f8e-4a1a-8291-5d59d2393573?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/j-winston-winery)

Desde el primer día que fuimos a conocer las instalaciones, el señor Gary fue muy atento y respetuoso, contestó a todas nuestras dudas. Tal vez nuestro evento fue algo fuera de lo común, a diferencia de los eventos de boda que se organizan aquí, nosotros contratamos el granero para el 25 de Diciembre para celebrar los 15 años de mi hija , sabemos que son días festivos donde la gente está con su familia , más sin embargo recibimos todo su apoyo para que el evento se hiciera realidad en este día tan especial , puedo decirles que fue una experiencia maravillosa, fue en evento de ensueño y de igual manera nos hospedamos en la casa, donde realmente nos sentimos como en nuestro hogar , sinceramente todas las instalaciones estuvieron limpias en todo momento, Gary estuvo al pendiente de si necesitábamos algo y al igual si la empresa que contratamos para la planeación necesitaban apoyo. Quiero animar a todos los papás que deseen hacerle su quinceañera a su hija, que consideren contratar los servicios de Suisun Valley Inn, ya que harán que su hija viva una experiencia única y de ensueño, no se arrepentirán. Sr Gary agradezco todas sus atenciones y muy pronto estaremos trabajando con usted para los 15 años de mi otra hija… Bendiciones”Fabiola M., 22 days ago![](https://images.zola.com/0dbc73ce-706c-4f4e-8b41-7324823426c8?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/suisun-valley-inn-at-monroe-ranch)

“We toured several venues, but Guglielmo’s permanent tent and rustic Italian storybook village surrounding is what sold it for us. Also, they had a package deal full of excellent local vendors! We went without a planner, which is risky, of course- but we did it and it wasn’t that hard- simply because with the all-inclusive package, the vendor vetting and research were very easy. Our initial point of contact left the company about a month after we signed, but the woman training under her, Brianna, did a great job assuming the role and owning the position. The wedding was even more beautiful than I could have imagined. The space is so naturally beautiful that when the decorations and settings are placed- it’s just next level simple, rustic luxury. This place is ultimate romance.”Maxine S., 6 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/guglielmo-winery)

“The pricing on here is wrong. The venue fee alone is almost 30k. Then the food and beverage minimum is 50k but if you have 150 guests you will spend more like 80k. Plus there is a service fee of at least 13k. So BEFORE photographer, footwear, videographer, band, decor etc. you’re already at around 123k.”Jane, 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/stanly-ranch)

“* Tour * We fell in love with Clos LaChance Vineyards (now CordeValle Winery) the moment we stepped onto property. We were looking for a winery wedding venue that could host up to 200 guests and where you could see vineyards from the ceremony and/or reception site; Clos has exactly that plus a golf course view! Our tour with Kristin Murphy ended with some wine tasting, both red and white. * Pre-Wedding * Kristin was incredible to work with! We had a lot of questions during the wedding planning process and she always had answers! Kristin was quick to respond via email and very accommodating when it came to special requests. Something that can’t go unnoticed was her expertise in the wedding industry and how knowledgeable she is to the property. * Wedding Day * The Clos LaChance event staff took care of everything day of wedding. They set up all of our signage in the exact location we asked for it to be placed. They placed our appetizers at our sweetheart table since we weren’t able to join Cocktail Hour. Not only did they take good care of us and our guests, the food that Chef Lu cooked was delicious (although we knew this coming out of the food tasting). * Overall * We would highly recommend Clos LaChance to anyone looking to host an elegant wedding. * Clos LaChance will always have a special place in our hearts. We look forward to our future visits reminiscing the best day of our lives along with a glass of 22 Pirates Red Blend and Reserve Chardonnay. Forever grateful, Iannick and Kelby”Kelby I., 13 days ago![](https://images.zola.com/e7db15dd-f0b4-4357-905b-de6c05108285?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/clos-lachance-winery)

## About wedding venues in Dublin, CA

### 

California offers an incredible 840 miles of coastline, 3,000+ wineries and ancient redwoods for your wedding day. When you choose the Golden State, you're getting exceptional natural lighting for your ceremony across diverse settings from Mediterranean coastal zones to alpine mountain backdrops. Each region has its own distinctive character that can perfectly match your vision.

### What Makes California Wedding Venues So Special?

Northern California's Napa Valley welcomes you with rolling vineyards and Spanish colonial architecture where intimate wine cave ceremonies create unforgettable moments. Head to Southern California and you'll find oceanfront venues like Duke's Malibu where you can exchange vows with the Pacific stretching out behind you while enjoying fresh coastal-inspired cuisine. Palm Springs offers dramatic desert venues with mountain backdrops and striking midcentury modern architecture that photographs beautifully.

### How Much Do Wedding Venues in California Cost?

Wedding venues in California typically run between $9,600 and $11,700 which aligns nicely with the national range of $6,500-$12,000. This represents about 18% of your total wedding budget. Your overall costs will vary based on guest count:

  * 50 guests: $26,190
  * 100 guests: $43,692
  * 150 guests: $60,141
  * 200 guests: $74,836
  * 250 guests: $89,530

Accessibility options have improved greatly across California venues in recent years.

### When Should You Book Your California Wedding Venue?

October leads venue inquiries in California with couples typically booking venues about 13 months (400 days) before their wedding date. If you're dreaming of a Northern California wine country wedding during peak season you'll want to book up to 18 months in advance. Southern California venues offer more flexibility especially during winter months when you can still enjoy beautiful weather while potentially securing better rates.
