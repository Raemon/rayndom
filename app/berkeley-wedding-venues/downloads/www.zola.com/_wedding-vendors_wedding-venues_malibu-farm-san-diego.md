  * ### Fantastic Venue!

•Verified review

•Christina N.•Oct 30, 2025

My daughter had a quick engagement so finding a location for her wedding and reception was tricky but Malibu came through! They accommodated us and we had the ceremony outside on their property since there were no permits available for the grass area nearby. Suzy and Riley were incredible with their communication, planning and help throughout the process and we were blown away with the setup the day of the wedding...they far exceeded our expectations! The food was delicious and the whole setup turned out beautifully!. I highly recommend Malibu Farms!!!

•Verified review

•Haley•Feb 4, 2025

As a wedding planner, I have seen hundreds of venues. Malibu Farm is so unique! It's modern boho combined with relaxed ocean vibes. So dreamy! Not to mention the craft food and drinks will leave your guests in awe!

  * ### Best of the best!

•Verified review

•Andy•Jan 2, 2025

Malibu Farm may be the best new venue in San Diego! From the location to the farm to table restaurant we were blown away with the attention to detail. The staff was welcoming and was amazing to see the culinary experience behind the large glass windows. We are so excited for the ceremony space looking out at The Coronado Bridge. If you are a bride to be and looking for a dream wedding venue in San Diego, look no further.

•Verified review

•Emilee•Sep 26, 2024

Malibu Farm San Diego was the perfect venue for our rehearsal dinner. From the moment we first inquired, the team was incredibly responsive, quick to answer our questions, and provided all the information we needed. The venue itself is absolutely beautiful, with a stunning location overlooking the ocean and gorgeous views. They were very helpful and enthusiastic throughout the entire process, ensuring our special night went off without a hitch. The value was unbeatable for the quality we received - we couldn't have asked for a better venue. We highly recommend Malibu Farm San Diego to any couple looking for a breathtaking setting for their rehearsal dinner.
