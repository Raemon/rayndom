I love capturing genuine moments and making sure my clients feel comfortable and enjoy the process. My style mixes candid shots with creative ideas to tell your story in a unique way. I'm a proud member of the Professional Photographers of America (PPA) and a Certified Professional Photograp﻿her (CPP). I take it as my first priority to attend to my clients needs to make sure everything goes as smoothly as possible when it comes to their special event.

To me, photography isn't just about getting perfect lighting or poses. It's about capturing the real essence of a moment - the smiles, the tears, and the connections that make an experience special. Sometimes the best photos come when we let go of the rules and focus on what feels right. You can see more reviews for my business on Google as well.

  * ### Fun and Flawless

•Verified review

•Cat R.•Oct 13, 2025

From the moment we first reached out to 4mmfoto Photography, we knew we were in good hands. Michael and his team were prompt, thorough, and thoughtful in their communication, putting us at ease throughout the entire wedding planning process. On the day of our wedding, Michael's professional and stellar work was evident in the vibrant, stunning photos he captured. He was a fun and calming presence, keeping us on schedule while ensuring that all our most special moments were beautifully preserved. We are thrilled with the final results and could not recommend 4mmfoto Photography more highly.

  * ### Extremely reliable and fast!

•Verified review

•Tatiana A.•Oct 6, 2025

I've been working with Michael 4mmfoto Photography since 2018, and he's always gone above and beyond to beautifully document our family events, including our wedding. The gallery was delivered faster than we expected, and the quality of the photos is exceptional. We couldn't be happier with 4mmfoto photography and highly recommend them to any couple planning their wedding.

We had such a great experience working with Michael! His studio offers a variety of beautiful backgrounds and setups, making it easy to capture exactly the look we wanted. He’s also incredibly flexible and easy to work with during events — always professional, attentive, and ready to adapt to any situation. The photos came out stunning, and he truly captured all the important moments perfectly. Highly recommend!

## Frequently asked questions

8 Answers

Ask them a question

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

My turnaround time varies by season. Typically, you’ll be able to view your photos online about 4-6 weeks after your wedding. The photos are delivered as an online gallery which you can share with your friends and family, and order prints if you'd like as well.

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically, couples book me about 13 months before their wedding date. I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible about my availability, even if you’re planning on a shorter time frame.

### Will you edit all our pictures?

Definitely. All final images will be edited for color, saturation, exposure, and sharpness to ensure they look beautiful. I also offer retouching services like blemish removal and teeth whitening for an additional charge.

### How many pictures will we get?

You can expect about 80 to 100 images per hour of photographing. But keep in mind this estimate varies depending on your wedding package, number of guests, venue type, and other factors.

### Do you have insurance?

I do! Just let me know if your venue requires a certificate of liability, and I’ll send that over to them.

### Do you also offer video services?

Yes, I can bring in the video services if needed.

### What’s your back-up plan if you can’t photograph our wedding as planned?

In my experience as a wedding photographer, I’ve never cancelled a booking. In the very rare event that I’m unable to photograph your wedding, I’ll make sure you’re covered by one of my colleagues or my contracted assistant. I’ll also provide you with a list of photographers from the many networking groups I’m in, so you can find the perfect replacement.

### Do you work with assistants or other photographers?

Sometimes, I’ll bring one or more assistant photographers depending on the size of your wedding. Don’t worry, this won’t cost you extra.
