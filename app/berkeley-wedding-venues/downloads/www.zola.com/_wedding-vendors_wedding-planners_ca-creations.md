I love people & love 💗 I get to utilize my 20+ years of experience in the service industry & B.A. in sociology to help my couples enjoy themselves during such a special time of their lives. Growing up in a large family I’ve been throwing/hosting parties & events what feels like my entire life (for free lol). Since a young age I would say that some day I’d be getting paid to throw parties because I loved it. Then in February of 2017 I finally decided to enter the industry professionally & also became the Venue Coordinator for The Yolanda Ranch. I was truly honored that then in 2018 & 2019 we were voted Best Wedding Venue in Yolo County 💗

💗 I love Creating Memories 💗 It is my most sincere desire to help others create the best memories possible especially during the most special times during their lives. Memories that will not only last a lifetime but be shared for generations. I genuinely consider it an honor to get to work with each couple in preparation for the beginning of their marriages & each client for his/her special occasion. There can't ever be enough love in this world and I strive to spread love and ensure my couples get to feel as much love as possible throughout their time with me and the planning process.

**In three words:** Calm, Empathetic, Flexible

  * ### We love Cristina!

•Verified review

•Alyssa P.•Nov 22, 2023

Cristina is amazing! My husband and I got engaged right before COVID hit, so we were checking out venues right before then. We met Cristina in March of 2020, and she made such a great impression on us we didn't forget her or the venue even after 2 years of waiting to start wedding planning again. We reached back out to her and were so happy she and the venue were still available. She did so much to help make our wedding experience the best it could be and more. She is incredibly personable, reliable, responsive, and I felt so much more comfortable knowing we had her to help and guide us through on our wedding day. All of the vendors she recommended were great and made it so much easier on us not having to try to do so much research on reliable and affordable vendors on our own. Cristina is so friendly and sweet, and is such a family and people person and made me, my husband, and my family feel like she truly cared about our wedding day and experience. My family is extremely important to us, and weddings can be stressful and she was able to gain that trust from my family immediately and we felt that we were in good hands. From beginning to end, she was such a tremendous help and I am so thankful for her, and her business!

  * ### Cristina is your dream wedding coordinator girl!

Cristina is an amazing coordinator! She walked us through all the steps from start to finish. She became a great friend during the process and very grateful for a stress free wedding planning journey because of her. Cristina will listen and make your dream vision come to life.
