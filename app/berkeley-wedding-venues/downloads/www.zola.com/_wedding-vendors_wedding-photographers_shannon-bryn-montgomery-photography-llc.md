My name is Shannon Van Groningen, as a California and destination wedding photographer, I specialize in bright, timeless, and true-to-color wedding photography that ensures every detail and emotion is beautifully preserved. From the iconic landscapes of California's Bay Area, South Lake Tahoe, and Southern California to luxurious destinations across the U.S., I’m here to document your love story in a way that feels natural and timeless.

I take the time to get to know you, ask the important questions, and build a genuine connection pre-wedding day. This is crucial to feeling comfortable in front of my camera, and feel vulnerable to share all your most cherished moments with (personal information protected by Zola) wedding day is just that- YOUR wedding day. This day will live in the memories of you, your spouse, your most loved ones forever. I promise to never "force" a moment, make your wedding day feel like an elaborate photoshoot, but guide and capture the action as it unfolds, with a little direction if needed, of course! Your day should feel like YOU.

  * ### Shannon is THE BEST

•Verified review

•Emily•Oct 9, 2025

Shannon took our engagement and wedding photos, and we are absolutely in love with them!! Her ability to capture candid emotions while also giving direction to us while taking photos was awesome. My husband and I always worry about being stiff or awkward in photos, and Shannon did an excellent job at making us comfortable in front of the camera- dare I say it was even fun!! Our pictures turned out gorgeous and I get messages from family members every day telling me how beautiful they are. Thank you SO much Shannon :)

  * ### The BEST wedding photographer

•Verified review

•Courtney+Josh•May 3, 2024

We hired Shannon for our wedding this year and it was one of the best decisions we made! She not only kept everything on time but she became a friend on that day as well. She captured every picture we wanted on our photo listed and delivered the most beautiful pictures from our day. She is professional, hardworking and the nicest photographer we have met.

  * ### Hire Shannon right now!

•Nicole Taylor Events•May 3, 2024

Shannon is phenomenal! As a planner, she is so easy to work with and so kind! She makes my couples feel comfortable in front of the camera and not only that, but the photos she takes are breathtaking. She is one of the kindest photographers out there with quality work to match! She will capture your day beautifully and it is always a joy to work with her.

## Frequently asked questions

5 Answers

Ask them a question

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically, couples book me about 6-12 months before their wedding date. I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible about my availability, even if you’re planning on a shorter time frame.

### Do you work with assistants or other photographers?

I always present the option to book a second photographer for a small uncharge, and one of my packages includes one!

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

My turnaround time varies by season. Typically, you’ll be able to view your photos online about 6-8 weeks after your wedding. You will get lots of sneaks within 48 hours of wedding day, though!

### Do you have insurance?

I do! Just let me know if your venue requires a certificate of liability, and I’ll send that over to them.

### What’s your back-up plan if you can’t photograph our wedding as planned?

In my 7 years of experience as a wedding photographer, I’ve never cancelled a booking. In the very rare event that I’m unable to photograph your wedding, I’ll make sure you’re covered by one of my colleagues or my contracted assistant. I’ll also provide you with a list of photographers from the many networking groups I’m in, so you can find the perfect replacement.
