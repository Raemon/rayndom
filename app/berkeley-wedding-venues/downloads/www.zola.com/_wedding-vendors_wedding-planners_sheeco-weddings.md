  * ### OMG Nicole is the best!

•Verified review

•Jen and D.•Jan 10

From the moment we started planning our wedding, Sheeco Weddings was an absolute joy to work with. Their communication style is direct yet compassionate, and they were always excited and friendly throughout the process. Nicole, our wedding planner, was incredibly detail-oriented and went above and beyond to make our special day perfect. She did extensive research to find the perfect decor that truly captured who we are as individuals and as a couple. Nicole took our chaotic Pinterest board and seamlessly brought it to life in the most cohesive way. It felt like we were working with a close friend who really knew what they were doing. Sheeco Weddings exceeded all of our expectations, and we are forever grateful for their incredible service.

  * ### Flawless Execution from Start to Finish

•Verified review

•Madilyn M.•Dec 22, 2025

We booked Sheeco Weddings—specifically Nicole—as our day-of coordinator, and we truly couldn’t recommend Nicole or the Sheeco team more. The way they structure their coordination services was an absolute dream. Starting about a month before the wedding, we began meeting with Nicole, and she took the time to truly get to know everything: our vendors, décor, family dynamics, and all the little details that make a wedding run smoothly. She created our full timeline and took over communication with all of our vendors, which was such a huge relief. The level of detail she thought through was incredible—things we never would have considered on our own. Having someone so organized and supportive leading up to the big day relieved so much stress. We had a very DIY wedding, with a lot of moving parts. All vendors were booked individually, and we brought in all of our décor ourselves—candles, hurricane glasses, table linens, napkins, cutlery, cups, name cards, signage for the bar, seating chart, welcome sign, and even our cake table (since we picked up the cake ourselves). Nicole and her assistant executed that vision perfectly—truly above and beyond our expectations. Everything was set up beautifully and exactly how we had imagined it. Because of Nicole and the Sheeco team, my husband and I, our families, and our wedding party were able to completely relax and be fully present on our wedding day. I knew that if anything came up, it would be handled seamlessly. We truly couldn’t have asked for a better day-of coordination/wedding management package. Nicole and Sheeco Events are absolutely worth it—hands down the best decision we made for our wedding.

  * ### Amazing experience! 

•Verified review

•Christine•Dec 19, 2025

We truly cannot say enough good things about Nicole & Diana. From the very beginning, they brought such care, warmth, and calm to the planning process, and on our wedding day everything ran seamlessly. Because of them, we were able to be fully present and genuinely enjoy every moment. As a queer couple, working with a planner who was openly affirming and inclusive meant the world to us. We felt fully seen, celebrated, and supported throughout the entire experience. The fact that this is a women-owned business only made us love working with Sheeco even more. Plus they were thoughtful with our budget and helped us make smart choices and still maintain the vision we had for our wedding. I HIGHLY recommend Nicole & Diana!! You won’t regret it!!

  * ### Best day of coordinator!!

•Verified review

•Willa Z.•Dec 16, 2025

Nicole from Sheeco Weddings was the best day of coordinator we could have asked for. From the moment we started working with Nicole, her communication was clear, prompt, and she was always on top of every detail (thinking through things that we never even considered)! The quality of their work and the value they provided was simply perfect - they made our day the best it could possibly be. Nicole was our go-to person throughout the process and on the day of the wedding, and we got endless compliments from our guests on how smoothly everything ran. She asked all the right questions, was ahead of every possible thing, and allowed us to truly be present and enjoy our special day without any bumps or issues. We are so grateful!!!

## Frequently asked questions

5 Answers

Ask them a question

### Do you also plan other events, like showers or rehearsal dinners?

Yes! We actually plan every type of event, even beyond weddings. We specialize in creating personalized and unique experiences that reflect our clients personalities and values.

### How much time should we expect to spend with you?

Depending on the package you choose, we will meet about once a week as needed during the duration of our time together. However, it's important to me that you trust me like a friend! You will have my number and we'll be texting as often as you need. The day of your wedding, I will be present for about 12 hours from set up until clean up.

### What does it mean to be a sustainable wedding planner?

At Sheeco Events, our mission is to maximize the positive impact your celebration can have on both the local community and the environment. We don’t aim for perfection—we believe that every thoughtful choice matters. Whether it’s sourcing pre-loved décor, using locally grown flowers, choosing compostable materials, or donating leftover food to nonprofits, we’re here to help you plan a wedding that aligns with your values. Our approach is never about judgment; we come from a place of love and genuine support in helping you do as much good as possible.

### Do you travel for weddings?

Absolutely—we love traveling for weddings! Most of the planning process happens virtually, which keeps our travel fees minimal and limited to covering the actual travel itself. Aside from that, our destination couples receive the same pricing, attention, and high-quality service as our local clients.

### Is a wedding planner worth the money?

100% yes! Okay, we might be a little biased, but here’s what I always say: At first, planning a wedding seems simple. Hire a few vendors, pick out some décor, send invitations, and show up—right? I wish it were that easy. Your wedding is the one day in your life when everyone you love most is in one place, celebrating you. Which is amazing, but t it also comes with a lot of pressure! For months, you are juggling logistics, managing expectations, and making a hundred tiny decisions... all while keeping up with your normal daily life. But when you work with us, we help you stay grounded and organized so you can actually enjoy the process!
