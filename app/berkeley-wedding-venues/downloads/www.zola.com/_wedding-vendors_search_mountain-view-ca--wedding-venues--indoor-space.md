Desde el primer día que fuimos a conocer las instalaciones, el señor Gary fue muy atento y respetuoso, contestó a todas nuestras dudas. Tal vez nuestro evento fue algo fuera de lo común, a diferencia de los eventos de boda que se organizan aquí, nosotros contratamos el granero para el 25 de Diciembre para celebrar los 15 años de mi hija , sabemos que son días festivos donde la gente está con su familia , más sin embargo recibimos todo su apoyo para que el evento se hiciera realidad en este día tan especial , puedo decirles que fue una experiencia maravillosa, fue en evento de ensueño y de igual manera nos hospedamos en la casa, donde realmente nos sentimos como en nuestro hogar , sinceramente todas las instalaciones estuvieron limpias en todo momento, Gary estuvo al pendiente de si necesitábamos algo y al igual si la empresa que contratamos para la planeación necesitaban apoyo. Quiero animar a todos los papás que deseen hacerle su quinceañera a su hija, que consideren contratar los servicios de Suisun Valley Inn, ya que harán que su hija viva una experiencia única y de ensueño, no se arrepentirán. Sr Gary agradezco todas sus atenciones y muy pronto estaremos trabajando con usted para los 15 años de mi otra hija… Bendiciones”Fabiola M., 22 days ago![](https://images.zola.com/0dbc73ce-706c-4f4e-8b41-7324823426c8?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/suisun-valley-inn-at-monroe-ranch)

“Fairview Crystal Springs was an absolute dream venue for our wedding! From the moment we first reached out, the team - especially Lindsey and Abbie - were incredibly responsive, quick to help, and went above and beyond to make our day magical. The venue itself is truly stunning, with beautiful grounds and an amazing crew that handled any issues we had with such care and ease. Everything felt seamless and the final result was absolutely breathtaking - I couldn't have asked for a better team or experience!

Jennifer and Priscilla was a pleasure to work with from start to finish. Even when I added a bunch of things last minute. They were able to help with all my questions. The venue is stunning and packaged vendors were just wonderful. This was my dream wedding. If I could change anything it would be to allow the food to stay out all night or just longer than 90 minutes. Also, if I could have gotten into the bridal suite to actually get my makeup done that would have been a nice touch. But that’s minor. The suite was lovely and spacious enough for my immediate family to do our touch ups and change. The drinks were nice and strong. This was the best day ever!”Latosha G., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/47ede32b-edb2-4b05-a54b-600c6c8b5608?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/eagle-ridge-by-wedgewood-weddings)

“Took a few emails to find the right person to manage a block of rooms for my daughter's wedding, but once we hooked up with Madeleine, everything went smoothly. Madeleine answered all my questions via email and phone since I was halfway across the country trying to set this up. Location was convenient to Winchester Mystery House, where our wedding was held.

“We had a wonderful experience working with the Saratoga Country Club for our wedding. From the very beginning and throughout the whole process, the event planner Sherry was always quick to respond and helpful with answering all my questions. The Country Club recently repainted and re-carpeted their reception room, and it looks so good! They had an event earlier in the day before our wedding, so I was super worried they wouldn't be able to set everything up quickly enough, but they did an amazing job! I had a minute to see the reception room before the ceremony, and they had arranged and decorated everything exactly how I had specified. The day-of reception coordinator, Mara, was also wonderful. She was super attentive and helpful, even checking on our parents multiple times throughout the evening to make sure they were happy. Would definitely recommend this venue for a South Bay wedding!”Abigail R., a year ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/saratoga-country-club)

“We had our wedding last November and Fogo de Chão was very helpful in every step of the way. We booked 3 rooms which was perfect for our small wedding. The staff was very helpful as well as the event and general manager. Food was delicious as always. Our ceremony ended early and the manager was nice accommodating our guests a little bit earlier while we got our photos taken. It was such a good experience that now my husband wants to celebrate our anniversary every year at Fogo de Chão.”Priscila H., 3 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/fogo-de-chao-san-jose-ca)

## About wedding venues in Mountain View, CA

### 

California offers an incredible 840 miles of coastline, 3,000+ wineries and ancient redwoods for your wedding day. When you choose the Golden State, you're getting exceptional natural lighting for your ceremony across diverse settings from Mediterranean coastal zones to alpine mountain backdrops. Each region has its own distinctive character that can perfectly match your vision.

### What Makes California Wedding Venues So Special?

Northern California's Napa Valley welcomes you with rolling vineyards and Spanish colonial architecture where intimate wine cave ceremonies create unforgettable moments. Head to Southern California and you'll find oceanfront venues like Duke's Malibu where you can exchange vows with the Pacific stretching out behind you while enjoying fresh coastal-inspired cuisine. Palm Springs offers dramatic desert venues with mountain backdrops and striking midcentury modern architecture that photographs beautifully.

### How Much Do Wedding Venues in California Cost?

Wedding venues in California typically run between $9,600 and $11,700 which aligns nicely with the national range of $6,500-$12,000. This represents about 18% of your total wedding budget. Your overall costs will vary based on guest count:

  * 50 guests: $26,190
  * 100 guests: $43,692

Accessibility options have improved greatly across California venues in recent years.

### When Should You Book Your California Wedding Venue?

October leads venue inquiries in California with couples typically booking venues about 13 months (400 days) before their wedding date. If you're dreaming of a Northern California wine country wedding during peak season you'll want to book up to 18 months in advance. Southern California venues offer more flexibility especially during winter months when you can still enjoy beautiful weather while potentially securing better rates.
