  * ### Couldn't be happier!

•Verified review

•Patricia•Jul 13, 2025

Found Joyce when I was looking for a photographer for my partner's college graduation pictures. She did an incredible job that we also hired her for our engagement photos. Joyce was a pleasure to work with and gave us great direction in poses and worked with the vision we had. We liked her photography style and had some great pricing options. She has great communication and really appreciated that her contract and email directions were clear. Would recommend to other couples!

  * ### We love our photos!

•Verified review

•Frances•May 27, 2025

We had a fantastic experience working Joyce as our wedding photographer in Vallejo! She had an incredible vision and knew captured all the special moments of our day. She’s also incredibly sweet and made us feel so comfortable throughout the entire process. She guided us every step of the way and knew all the best angles and poses to make us look our best. We absolutely loved working with her, and our family and friends can’t stop raving about how beautiful the photos turned out. We’re so pleased with the final results and highly recommend her to anyone looking for a talented and professional photographer.

  * ### Thank You!!!

•Verified review

•H+C•Mar 11, 2025

As we were narrowing down our search for our wedding photographer, we reached out to Joyce with a long list of questions regarding everything that you could possibly think of when deciding on who to move forward with to capture your wedding day. She answered all our questions with great detail and even included recent galleries for us to review. We ultimately decided to move forward with Joyce since it was so easy to communicate with her and we felt that her photography style and her personality matched what we were looking for. The wedding package we chose included an engagement session with Joyce and we were nervous about how it would go because it was our first professional shoot as a couple. Joyce guided us throughout our session with the different poses we did and made us feel comfortable in our own skin. The photos turned out amazing and we appreciate the super quick turnaround! Thanks Joyce, we are looking forward to having you capture our big day!
