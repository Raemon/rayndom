  * ### Serene Ranch Wedding 5/25/2024

•Verified review

•Hannah K.•Dec 19, 2025

Kristina and Susan were hands down the best decision that my husband and I made in our wedding process. I hit the ground running once we got engaged and was about 8 months into the journey when I started wondering what I was doing with myself and panicking about all of the details that I was still needing to figure out. After exploring various options in terms of wedding planning, I found The Orange Dragonfly and from there the rest was history! Right after I met with Kristina and Susan, we were automatically at ease. No matter what questions we had or details we needed help with, they were there and ready to guide us. They did not only make everything leading up to the big day feel far less daunting, but the day of the wedding went by seamlessly thanks to them and their abundance of care and attention to detail. There were of course small and unexpected changes that popped up on the wedding day, but we never felt a single worry or stress because of our confidence that they had it taken care of. On top of this, throughout the whole day and night, they went out of their way to make sure that Alex and I took breaks to soak everything in and even kept grabbing us drinks from the bar and ensuring that we had what we needed. I could honestly write an entire novel just singing their praises, but the bottomline is that you could never regret trusting your wedding with these lovely ladies! We are so blessed and thankful for all of their help and support. Thank you, Kristina and Susan!
