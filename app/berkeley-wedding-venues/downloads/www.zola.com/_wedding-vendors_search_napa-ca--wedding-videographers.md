  * Storytelling style

  * Serves Napa, CA

Growing up in New Zealand, England and the US means I've had my fair share of adventures. I’ve spent 15 years telling stories through video, poetry, and photography - and the weddings I capture are rooted in that same deep attention to detail and care. With my sister as second shooter, a couple drones (Bug & Sheldon), and a documentarian’s eye behind the lens, I make art from the real. Having seen 30+ countries and indulged in every experience you can think of - I bring a global perspective and a personal touch to every film. This isn’t just a highlight reel. It’s your story - the way it really felt.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Alex was amazing for our San Francisco wedding! He captured everything from our hotel prep to the last dance at the reception. He handled all three locations like a pro - especially the gorgeous outdoor space and ballroom at the Conservatory at One Sansome. He got along great with our big wedding party (no small feat!) and stayed cool and friendly all day. Communication was on point before, during, and after the wedding, and he rolled with any changes without missing a beat. His technical abilities truly impressed us. The steady-cam footage was smooth and professional, while the drone shots added a stunning cinematic quality. We're obsessed with both our full wedding video and the shorter cut he made for social media. When I asked for a few tweaks, Alex jumped right on them with zero drama. What makes Alex special is how much he genuinely cares about getting your vision just right. If you want someone who's talented, easy to work with, and passionate about making your wedding video perfect - Alex is your guy! Highly recommend!”Leah H., 9 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/8eb38db8-eaf4-44a2-9d16-3bbb21e2b5ac?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-videographers/fern-film)

He is a consummate professional, was always in the right place at the right time to capture every special moment, easy to work with, and an enjoyable presence (which I think can be an overlooked characteristic when it comes to booking wedding vendors). He came loaded with equipment, the flower girls especially loved watching him shoot the venue with the drone. I planned the wedding for my sister, so I recruited vendors I was familiar with, hoping she and her new husband would love them as much as I do- and they were so happy with everything- just an amazing experience to work with Brandon again.

They were incredibly prompt on the big day and kept everything moving smoothly without us ever feeling rushed. Their friendly, upbeat attitude made it easy to relax and enjoy every moment. Because they knew the layout of Stambaugh so well, they anticipated shots and transitions perfectly. That familiarity with the venue helped everything flow naturally throughout the day. They captured so many meaningful moments, both big and small, that we still cherish. Our wedding was documented beautifully and authentically. Even now, six years later, we find ourselves watching the footage on a regular basis. The video instantly brings us back to how that day felt.

Hi! Courtney here (that's me on the left!). Shutter and Sound is the brainchild of renowned wedding videographer Ryan Geldermann. Ryan began his wedding videography career in 2010 in Los Angeles and quickly became recognized as one of the top videographers in the U.S.. After relocating to DC and still receiving countless inquiries from all corners of the country, Ryan decided to recruit and train a few talented friends so he could continue offering the quality wedding videography he’s known for in SoCal and eventually over 10 cities. Shutter and Sound is a very small group of filmmakers dedicated to turning your big day into a work of art.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“I had the pleasure of working with Kaylee and Alexis as the planner for a wedding in South Georgia.
