## About this venue

The Bird Ranch at San Luis Creek is a 1906 old chicken farm with a riparian zone. The 32-acre farm runs along the last stretch of the San Luis Creek that is canopied by 109 of the state’s largest cottonwood trees with California's Central Valley’s largest Blue Heron rookery. It is located in the San Joaquin Valley in Central California and is 1.6 miles from Santa Nella, CA and 73 miles from San Jose, CA. Definitely a one-of-a-kind venue and is the ideal backdrop for a wedding, celebration, corporate event, or simple getaway to listen to the “songs of the birds.” Its classic farmhouse charm makes it perfect for farmstays.

  * ### A dream venue! Magical and unforgettable

•Verified review

•Alexis•Dec 10, 2025

The Bird Ranch is pure magic. From the moment we arrived, it felt like stepping into another world. It's serene, timeless, and has so much attention to detail. Every inch of the property is beautifully designed. Julie the owner has made it cozy with beautiful interiors and sprawling curated outdoor spaces. The presence of nature is so incredible (butterflies, birds, creek, etc.) We hosted our weekend here, and it was perfect. The property has an incredible balance of rustic charm and thoughtful modern touches. It's the kind of place that instantly makes everyone feel at ease. This place has so much soul. It’s not just a venue, it’s an experience. If you’re looking for a space that feels elevated but still grounded and deeply authentic, this is it!! I can’t recommend it enough.
