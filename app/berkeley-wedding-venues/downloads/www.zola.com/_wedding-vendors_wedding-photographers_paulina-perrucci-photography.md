Nothing inspires me more than capturing the love and romance that brought two people together. Getting those intimate emotions and moments that couples can treasure forever! I am a native Californian that loves to hop on a plane and shoot destination weddings in far off places. Achieving romantic and timeless images with natural light is my forte. My goal is to make from your entire experience from engagement to your wedding day all you dreamed and wished for. Please go to my website to read praise from past clients

•Anna C.•May 27, 2023

Paulina is an amazing photographer - we hired her for engagement and wedding photography! She is so pleasant to work with and is super friendly, which really helps to make us and our guests feel comfortable on the other side of the lens! This translates really well into the photos, as she is able to capture everyone naturally! On the day of our wedding, she was a great orchestrator as she gathered our guests and went through our group portraits efficiently and with the best light. Not only that, but as we (and some of our guests) are not sure how to pose, she was able to provide cues to make sure we were captured at our best angles!! She also made my husband and I feel extremely special, and made sure to make this day stress-free for us!!! She also processes her photos very quickly without any loss of quality - we received our sneak peeks the day after our wedding, our full wedding photos 1.5 months after our wedding, and our engagement photos 1 week after the shoot. I am absolutely in love with our photos (she made us look amazing!!), and we plan to print these to display over our home. Highly recommend hiring her for any of your photography needs!!!

Working with Paulina has been the best experience and multiple occasions! We would not hire any other photographer but her within the Bay Area! She was there for our engagement, engagement photos, and wedding photos as well. She truly captures natural beauty and has such a creative way of looking through the camera. She is warm and comforting so she never makes you feel awkward or uncomfortable! She also always comes prepared with fun props and things to make the pictures have even more character. So if you have an upcoming event or wedding BOOK THEM!

  * ### Blissful experience..

•Veronica Flemming•Aug 17, 2020

We loved working with Paulina Perrucci Photography. Our family fell in love with her and she made everyone feel comfortable while getting everyone’s photos. She was a trooper, she came out to Lake Tahoe and was up for finding some hidden beaches to photograph some more intimate photos for my parter and I. We are so happy with our photos and the energy she brought to our wedding.

## Frequently asked questions

10 Answers

Ask them a question

### What's your style?

My photography style is romantic and relaxed and I believe in raw emotions and capturing the true essence of your wedding day. My ultimate goal is to preserve your special moments by creating visually striking imagery to be enjoyed for years to come.

### How did you start photographing wedding?

I started shooting fashion right after school but found out that I loved wedding photography and how the big day unfolds. Meeting new couples and seeing how their love story evolved is endearing. I look forward to shooting a couple’s engagement session. It is a great place to get to know the client and make them feel comfortable in front of the camera

### Do you offer custom packages?

Yes, absolutely. I can customize anything to make sure your final package fits your specific needs perfectly. I also offer an intimate wedding package that is perfect for a smaller wedding day with an abbreviated coverage.

### How long in advance should I book you to hold my date?

If you are requesting a Saturday, the earlier the better. I book out over a year in advance. To secure your date I require a signed contract and retainer.

### Do you do destination weddings? Are there travel fees?

YES! I will travel anywhere! I have a travel expense sheet I can share with you pre your request.

### Will we need a second photographer?

Some of my packages include a second photographer. It mainly depending on the size of your guest list and if you will have multiple locations. I am happy to make a recommendation whether a second shooter is needed for your wedding. My second shooters are professional and have a similar style to mine.

### Do we need an engagement session?

Engagement Sessions come with some of my packages. It is not required but I find couples are more comfortable in front of the camera on their wedding day after doing an engagement session with me.

### Will you stay till the end of the wedding?

Of course! Many of my packages include all day coverage. Additional coverage is also available if needed.

### Do you have insurance?

Yes, I can provide proof of insurance should your venue request .

### How and when will we receive our images?

You will receive a link to an online gallery with color and black/white high resolution digital images for for you and your family to download in about 6-8 week after your wedding.
