I am an East Coast transplant wedding photographer based in the SF Bay area. I’m super laid back and kind of a goofball… I like to have fun during my photo sessions to make you feel comfortable in front of the camera!

J. Lee Photography was founded in 2016 and over the years I’ve shot around 100+ weddings. I believe in true love and I want to be the one to photograph it. When you look back on your wedding day, all you will have left are your photos! I capture real moments, real emotions and real love.

•Clarissa R.•Dec 23, 2025

J. Lee Photography was an absolute delight to work with for our wedding day! The quirky and fun communication style made her super easy to talk to, and we felt at ease with her from the start. Not only did she include our engagement photos, but captured our wedding day beautifully as well. We received so many gorgeous photos back that we could hardly choose which ones to post - the value was incredible for the quality of the work. She was a pleasure to have around, and we even spotted her out on the dance floor with us, capturing all the fun moments. The guests and I loved having her there to document our special day. We are thrilled with the results and would highly recommend J. Lee Photography to any couple looking for a talented, personable photographer.

We knew we were in good hands from the moment we first spoke with Jess. Her communication style was friendly, informative, and down-to-earth, making us feel at ease throughout the entire process. Her passion for weddings shone through in the stunning, emotional, and creative images she captured, perfectly preserving the special moments of our big day. We are thrilled with the final gallery and would highly recommend J. Lee Photography to any couple seeking a truly exceptional photography experience that you'll love.

From the moment we booked J. Lee Photography, her friendly, fun, and engaging communication style put us at ease. Her photos exceeded our expectations, and we were thrilled with the how amazing we looked! On the day of our wedding, she helped coordinate the timeline seamlessly, ensuring we stayed on schedule and didn't miss a moment. We are so grateful to have had Jess capture our special day with such care and expertise.

## Frequently asked questions

5 Answers

Ask them a question

### Do you work with assistants or other photographers?

Yes, a second photographer is included in my wedding packages. I make sure they are just as professional as I am, and we enjoy working together to create a smooth and memorable wedding day for you!

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Most couples reach out to me about 13 months before their wedding date, which is great! I’d love to hear from you as soon as you can, even if your plans are on a shorter timeline. Let’s chat about how I can help make your day special!

### What is your backup process for our photos?

I use a portable SSD hard drive, a larger backup hard drive and upload all files to Dropbox usually the same night or next day after your wedding. Plus all your images stay on the SD cards until your gallery is delivered to you!

### How many pictures will we get?

You can expect about 80 to 100 images per hour of photographing. But keep in mind this estimate varies depending on your wedding package, number of guests, venue type, and other factors.

### Will you edit all our pictures?

Definitely. All final images will be edited for color, saturation, exposure, and sharpness to ensure they look beautiful.
