The venue itself was stunning and so beautiful, it was the perfect backdrop for our special day. The quality of their work and the value we received was incredible. We are so grateful to the entire team at The Century for making our wedding day truly unforgettable!

  * ### The Perfect Day at The Century

•Verified review

•Enrique & R.•Oct 29, 2025

Our wedding at The Century was everything we hoped for and more. The venue is stunning—elegant, timeless, and perfectly laid out for both the ceremony and reception. Erica, our coordinator, was absolutely amazing. She went above and beyond to make sure every detail was flawless, staying calm, organized, and incredibly professional throughout the entire process. The staff was attentive and friendly, the food and drinks were excellent, and the whole event ran seamlessly from start to finish. Every guest complimented the atmosphere and how smooth everything felt. The value was outstanding for the quality of service we received. We can’t recommend The Century highly enough—it was the perfect setting for our wedding day.

Response from vendor•Nov 3, 2025

Thank you so much for sharing this beautiful review, it means the world to our entire team. We are honored to have been part of your celebration, and knowing your evening felt effortless, elegant, and unforgettable is exactly why we do what we do. Erica and our event team will be over the moon to hear your kind words. Their passion lies in anticipating needs and creating seamless moments, so your feedback is the ultimate compliment. We’re thrilled you enjoyed the food, ambiance, and flow of the night, from vendor coordination to lighting and dinner service. Delivering a five-star experience without the five-star stress (or price tag) is what we strive for, and we're grateful you felt that. Wishing you both a lifetime of love, joy, and celebrations even more magical, though we’ll politely argue your wedding set a pretty high bar. ✨

•Verified review

•Kris L.•Jul 24, 2025

The Century was the perfect venue for our wedding. From the moment we first inquired, the team was quick to respond, incredibly thorough in their communication, and made the entire planning process smooth and stress-free. Erica Ford, our event coordinator, was an absolute pleasure to work with - she was incredibly kind, detail-oriented, and went above and beyond to ensure our special day was everything we dreamed of. The venue itself provided ample space for our guests to mingle and celebrate, and the team's attention to detail and execution was flawless. We are so grateful to have had The Century as our wedding venue and highly recommend them to any couple looking for a beautiful, well-run space to host their big day.

Response from vendor•Jul 27, 2025

Thank you so much for your kind words! I am so glad to hear that your experience with myself and our venue exceeded your expectations. Xoxo, Erica

•Verified review

•Scott P.•Apr 14, 2025

The Century is an excellent choice for any event. My wife and I had our wedding reception at the venue and it was the best possible experience. The team at the Century is warm, welcoming, and flexible. They adapt to any situation presented. The food was amazing, the drinks were fantastic and entertaining. The space felt intimate and still had enough space for all our needs. Erica Ford is enthusiastic, passionate, and genuinely loves to work with her clients. If you are looking for an event space, this is the one for you.

Response from vendor•Apr 16, 2025

Scott and Alex, Thank you so much! I'm still in awe of everything! From your live painter to the both of you hitting the dance floor to N*Sync (one of my favorite boy bands by the way!) Your day of love was incredible! I wish you both nothing but the best! -Erica
