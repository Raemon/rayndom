Photography by Orlando is one of the premiere wedding photography studios in the world. Orlando is an international award winning photographer. Being married for 12 years and having two children Owen who is 12 and Olivia who is 8. I know incredible it is to look back at our wedding images and relive how the day unfolded with our children. It really shows you how powerful and important photography is! We will document your day in the most unique way possible, always unobtrusive and low key! Working with our team will ensure imagery that you and your family will cherish for years and generations to come.

Your wedding photography is your one chance to look back at this monumental moment, your wedding, and tell your story. There are an infinite amount of details a couple must consider before their big day. There's the ceremony, the reception, the flowers, the invitations, and the dress, of course, but the most important decision you will make is your wedding photographer. We believe that you have a story to tell with your wedding. Your pictures should truly capture you and your loved one, with photographs that are modern, yet timeless. You should be able to remember not just what you did during your wedding, but also how you felt.

•Miranda D.•Oct 20, 2024

We do not have enough great things to say about Orlando. Book book book him! We had the best experience with Orlando as our wedding photographer. He made everything feel so easy and fun. He was laid-back yet focused, capturing all the special moments without any stress. Orlando has a fantastic eye for detail and knows how to get the best shots while keeping things light and enjoyable. If you're looking for a photographer who’s easy to work with and delivers stunning results, Orlando is the one!

  * ### The BEST 

•Verified review

•Desarae Orgo•Apr 6, 2024

Orlando and his team are the best of the best! If you are looking for a chill and stress free wedding day, book Orlando! Before booking Orlando and his team, we saw them in action at many weddings and knew they were the best match for us! They are super lively, energetic, and professional! We have recommended them to everyone we know because of the great experience we’ve had! Our photos were sent to us in less than two weeks and they were breathtaking! We have gotten so many compliments!! We love Orlando and his team and we cannot wait to work with them again!

  * ### Orlando made all my photo dreams come true!

•Verified review

•Melanie & E.•Jan 11, 2021

Orlando and his team were professional while still maintaining a good sense of humor that allowed us to feel relaxed and at ease. We did both photo and video and the pictures were breathtaking while our video captured the day beyond perfectly. Orlando was able to capture every angle and every photo I asked of him plus more. Not only was his work above and beyond but as a person he was a pleasure to work with. He is the best of the best and it shows through his work. Book him ASAP!!
