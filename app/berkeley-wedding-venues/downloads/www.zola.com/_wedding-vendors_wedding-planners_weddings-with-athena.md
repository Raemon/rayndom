  * ### Reliable Day-of-Coordinator!!

•Verified review

•daffodil n.•Dec 14, 2025

Incredible is truly an understatement. We were so blessed to have Athena as our day-of coordinator, and from start to finish, she was kind, patient, supportive, thoughtful, and most of all so much fun to work with. 100% a cheerleader for love. Every interaction with her felt reassuring, and her calm, positive presence made such a difference throughout the entire process. In the weeks leading up to our wedding, she went above and beyond by taking the time to hop on a call with us to review our table settings and color palette, easing our stress and offering thoughtful design guidance that helped everything feel just right. She carefully worked with us to create our wedding timeline, ensured every moment flowed seamlessly, and on the wedding day, she kept the entire night running smoothly and on schedule without us ever having to worry. Athena was incredibly organized and attentive, working directly with vendors for set-up, breakdown, and all the in-between details, while also making sure we were always taken care of—whether it was having food on our plates or a drink in our hands. Because of her, we truly felt at ease and were able to be fully present, soaking in every moment with each other and our loved ones.The night was absolutely perfect, and we couldn’t have asked for a better person to guide us through such a meaningful day. Whether you’re looking for an event planner or you’re a do-it-yourself girlie who needs the right support, you cannot go wrong with Athena’s services. She is genuinely one of a kind and simply the best.

  * ### Wedding Planner Review- Athena Balal 

•Verified review

•Diane T.•Nov 2, 2025

Meeting Athena Balal was truly one of the best things that happened in my entire wedding planning journey. I still remember walking into the very first venue I visited, full of excitement and uncertainty, and being introduced to her, and from that moment, everything just clicked. There was such a genuine warmth and connection; it felt like talking to a friend who immediately understood what we wanted and how special this day was going to be for us. Throughout the entire planning process, Athena was the definition of patience and grace. We came to her with a million ideas, endless Pinterest boards, and constant “what ifs”, and she never once made us feel overwhelmed or lost. Instead, she listened carefully, offered thoughtful guidance, and helped us shape our many scattered dreams into a beautiful, cohesive vision. What stood out the most was how present Athena was every single step of the way. From venue visits to vendor calls, timelines, and decor decisions, she was always by our side, organized, calm, and incredibly reassuring. When the big day finally came, Athena’s coordination was flawless. Every detail flowed seamlessly, every moment felt effortless, and there wasn’t a single hiccup. We were able to be fully in the moment, soaking in every bit of joy, knowing Athena had everything under control. She stayed with us until the very end of the night, making sure everything went exactly as planned and that we truly had the dream wedding we had imagined. Thanks to Athena, our wedding wasn’t just beautiful, it was meaningful, stress-free, and unforgettable. If you’re lucky enough to have Athena as your wedding planner, you can trust that your special day will be nothing short of perfect.

  * ### The Best Day Ever

•Verified review

•Tylore K.•Oct 14, 2025

The BEST wedding planner ever, shoutout Sheila for sliding into my DMs and telling me that Athena was a wedding planner because that was the best decision I could have made to make my wedding a complete dream come true. I had a vision and Athena did the best at making sure everything I wanted I could have without our budget. She took soooooo much stress off my plate, the day of the wedding all i had to focus on was having fun and didn't think of or even hear about any issues that might have occurred. I cannot recommend her enough truly.

  * ### Best planner ever

•Verified review

•Diana•Sep 16, 2025

Athena was so much more than just our planner: she was our rock, our supporter, and our biggest cheerleader throughout the entire process. I honestly could not have asked for anyone better to be part of our wedding. She helped us create the timeline, designed our decor, created our floor plan, assisted in our rehearsal, kept me on track with my tasks, and even stepped in to meet with vendors when I was overwhelmed. The entire day was perfect - and she made sure I had a drink in my hand and food on my plate at all times!! Our entire wedding party, parents, and guests adored her and recognized all the hard work she was doing. We could not have done our wedding without her. If you are looking for someone who will not only execute your vision but will also feel like a beloved part of your family, look no further than Athena.

## Frequently asked questions

2 Answers

Ask them a question

### Do you also plan other events, like showers or rehearsal dinners?

Yes! I’ve planned it all—from proposals and intimate birthday parties to bridal showers, rehearsal dinners, and more. No matter the occasion, I love bringing special moments to life with thoughtful planning and seamless execution. Let me know what you have in mind, and I’d be happy to help!

### Do you take on multiple weddings in a day or weekend?

I typically take on only one wedding per weekend to ensure my full attention is on your special day. However, depending on the size and needs of an event, I may take on multiple. For larger weddings, I prefer to reserve the whole weekend to provide the best experience possible.
