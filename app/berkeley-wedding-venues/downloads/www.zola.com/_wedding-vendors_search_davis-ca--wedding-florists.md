Flowers by Heather 5.0

  * Starts at $2,000 
  * Serves Davis, CA

After serving the Bay Area for years, I've moved to Lincoln and looking forward to serving our new community. A little about me: Always lived in the country raising cattle and horses. Grew up learning from mother about all things florals. Worked in vet med for years while also doing wedding flowers with my mother. Now that my husband and I have moved to Lincoln I decided to start my floral business full time.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Heather was a dream vendor to work with. She helped make this vision come to life- from planning, strategizing my budget, introducing me to different ideas and creating pieces that I was able to use during my ceremony and repurpose for my reception. She was so understanding, flexible, easy to work with and gave me the most grace when I was undecided on something. She is patient and kind and I couldn’t recommend anyone else on such a stressful/important day- she goes above and beyond. Her communication is excellent and her attention to detail is immaculate. Our flowers were beautiful and high quality. All of the pieces were put together with excellent care and didn’t fall apart. Our boutonnières were magnets- easy for the men to put on! She created a pocket boutonnière for the groom that was so different and special. My bridal bouquet was the perfect size and wasn’t heavy at all! She even did our petals for our flower girls. Heather, we loved working with you and look forward to future events where you can help execute our next vision. Thank you for everything and all of your hard work . Love, The Parkers”Megan M., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/4abfda7b-86ff-4225-9a59-7bb1c2bc0056?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/flowers-by-heather)

Elissa Dunn Floral Studio 5.0

Welcome friends! My name is Elissa, and I own Elissa Dunn Floral Studio. I provide floral designs for weddings and events in Northern CA. I currently reside in El Dorado Hills with my husband and our two dogs, Cash & Cooper. When I am not flowering, I enjoy fly fishing, hiking, and spending time with friends and family. I’ve always had a creative and entrepreneurial spirit, however upon graduating school I had no idea what I wanted to pursue. A close friend helped me to secure an office admin job at an amazing floral design company in the Bay Area.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Elissa was absolutely fantastic to work with.

  * Offer

I grew up in a florist shop and always loved flowers. When faux flower became so good they were fooling gardeners and bees, I knew this business would be good for everyone. I can help save the environment as well as make wedding ceremonies absolutely stunning! I specialize in making the ceremony site dazzle with large floral pre-made instillations. These florals can be moved, for a small relocation fee, to your reception to make a dynamic sweetheart, cake table or entryway. I do not offer centerpieces or bouquets. I have found most brides want these fresh. I do however carry single rose bud centerpieces in white, pink or red only.“Lush and amazing, it was hard to believe the flowers weren't real. They were pleasant to touch, soft and plaint, almost moist looking. Heather Dodd was most pleasant to work with and full of creative ideas.”Nanci, 16 days ago![](https://images.zola.com/ce31cea4-91b6-465e-b626-9a4cbba25b71?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/timeless-arches-llc)

Working for myself still gives me the opportunity to get to do my favorite job of being a mama while also getting to do something I have such a passion for, flowers and people!

Flower Moxie – Do-It-Yourself Wedding Flowers 4.9

  * Starts at $350 
  * Serves Davis, CA

In 2013, 8-year wedding veteran Amy McCord Jones realizes she wouldn't be able to afford to hire her own floral services if she was a bride. Then, Amy discovers that there is basically zero help available for DIY brides. No flower recipes. No instructions. No access to florist-grade blooms. Rude. So she launches Flower Moxie! Flower Moxie remains a humble, tucked-away small business out of Oklahoma City. We don’t zoom around on scooters in some fancy high-rise. We stock an average kitchen with canned wine and Aldi chips and listen to true crime podcasts while photographing curvy ranunculus. Join us. There’s cake, hugs, and acceptance here.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“I used the Full Monty package for my wedding. Flowers were something I wasn’t looking to spend 10-12k on. Through my calls with the flower moxie team they clearly and efficiently helped me stay within budget and provide my dream florals. I began my arrangements on Friday and transported them 1 and a half hours away and had very very minimal flower loss. My bridesmaids and I made our bouquets the night before and what a beautiful memory. I would recommend flower moxie for anyone looking for a fun diy, beautiful flowers, and budget friendly items.”Courtney E., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/150ddfb9-8460-4ae2-b160-9a917ea0f77c?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/flower-moxie)

🌹 WE ARE NOT FRESH FLOWER FLORISTS. WE WORK WITH WOOD & FAUX FLOWERS.

Besides designing for you, I also offer DIY Wood Flower Experiences to create your wedding florals alongside me in person or virtually and 1:1 sessions to help DIY brides learn to do it themselves.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Jen was AMAZING to work with! When it came to flowers for my wedding, I had NO IDEA what I wanted. She was very patient with me and helped talk me through my vision. She gave me flowers to pick from, talked about how big I wanted my bouquet and how much greenery I wanted, and then when I could find colors I liked in swatches, she color-matched the colors I wanted from an inspo pic I found online! She was very professional and patient with me, even when my plans changed or I needed to add to my order. I am not the best at putting together a bouquet. I am also someone who likes control, especially when it came to planning my wedding. I was thankful that I was able to give Jen the reins, tell her what I wanted, and watch her make my dreams come true. When I first saw my flowers, I was speechless. She truly did make my floral dreams come true, and now I get to keep my bouquet for the rest of my life! A wooden flower bouquet from Jen is the way to go!”Kaylee, a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/4cc97082-6b17-4fb6-b34c-a3506de512c5?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/wood-word-blooms)

She has been an absolute joy to work with. From the very beginning, Autumn was responsive, patient, and respectful in her communication, taking the time to understand our vision and work within our budget. The result was truly stunning - the floral arrangements were beautiful, creative, and one of a kind. She created a pink purple white garden-style palette for our ceremony on the lawn, and a moody berry plum-y palette for the more artsy cocktail hour and reception later that night. Autumn navigated the venue's policies regarding floral delivery and decoration style with great attention to detail, and she even enhanced the unique color palette we had requested with her own creative flair. We were thrilled with how everything turned out and would highly recommend Autumn Marcelle Design to any couple planning their wedding.”Claire Z., 4 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/7cb479d3-2db8-4210-918c-25e42100b5d5?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-florists/l-artiste-fleur)
