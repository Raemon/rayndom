Hi, I’m Ana Since 2017, I’ve specialized in romantic, emotion-driven wedding storytelling, capturing love in its realest moments from quiet in-betweens to joy-filled celebrations. My approach blends timeless, guided portraits with candid storytelling so your images feel natural, elevated, and meaningful. On your wedding day, I’m more than just your photographer I’m your calm presence, hype girl, and professional third wheel, guiding you every step so you can stay present and enjoy every moment. If you’re looking for someone who will care deeply about your story, you’re in the right place.

What sets me apart is the experience. I don’t just show up with a camera I show up with intention, energy, and a deep commitment to making you feel comfortable and confident. I guide you every step of the way so nothing ever feels awkward or forced, while still leaving room for real, unscripted moments. I focus on storytelling, emotion, and connection, delivering images that don’t just look beautiful, but feel meaningful. You’ll walk away feeling celebrated, relaxed, and truly seen and that makes all the difference.

Ana at HerLifeBehindTheLens Photography is truly a talented and dedicated professional. From our very first interaction, her positive attitude and passion for her work put us at ease. Ana's stunning, captivating photography is both impressive and memorizing - she has an incredible eye for detail and an ability to capture the beauty and intimacy of our most special moments. As a shy couple, we were amazed at how comfortable and beautiful Ana made us feel in front of the camera. Her work speaks for itself, and we have returned to her year after year to document the milestones in our lives. I highly recommend HerLifeBehindTheLens Photography to anyone looking for a photographer who will not disappoint.

  * ### The BEST in the game!! 

•Verified review

•Priscilla M.•Sep 26, 2024

From our first interaction, the team at HerLifeBehindTheLens Photography demonstrated a professional, fun, and caring communication style. They were incredibly dedicated, reliable, organized, and consistent in their work, exceeding our expectations every step of the way. Ana, our lead photographer, went above and beyond to ensure our special day went smoothly - she even picked up my dress the night before to make sure it arrived safely and on time to the venue. She also made sure to capture all the important family photos we wanted. Ana's hard work, genuine caring personality, and attention to detail made my husband and I, as well as our entire family, feel completely comfortable and valued throughout the entire process. HerLifeBehindTheLens Photography is truly the best wedding photography team we could have asked for.

## Frequently asked questions

5 Answers

Ask them a question

### How many pictures will we get?

You can expect about 80 to 100 images per hour of photographing. But keep in mind this estimate varies depending on your wedding package, number of guests, venue type, and other factors.

### What’s your back-up plan if you can’t photograph our wedding as planned?

In my 7 years of experience as a wedding photographer, I’ve never cancelled a booking. In the very rare event that I’m unable to photograph your wedding, I’ll make sure you’re covered by one of my colleagues or my contracted assistant. I’ll also provide you with a list of photographers from the many networking groups I’m in, so you can find the perfect replacement.

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically, couples book me about 6-13 months before their wedding date. I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible about my availability, even if you’re planning on a shorter time frame.

### What equipment do you use to make sure that you capture what we are looking for in our wedding photos?

Well theirs a numerous amounts of camera gear that I carry with me and won't go into tech savvy terms LoL. But Just to keep it cute and simple and straight to the point, I always have three cameras with me. Two I have loaded on my camera straps with two different lenses to capture two different vibes. My third camera body will always be in my book bag incase we need a backup plan for any reason (wether its damage to a camera or one just simply sleeps on me mid day lol). I always have 6 different lens options on me to be able to capture from a far and up close within seconds of each image being triggered.

### Do you charge per photo or per hour?

My rates are charged per the hour. I don't charge per photo taken due to the fact that its your wedding day and Limiting you on photographs per hour that is being captured is simply just not my style of work. I love to capture even the smallest detail for you and wouldn't find it fair to hold your sweet small moments hostage just because LoL.
