  * ### Post-Engagement Party Bus

•Verified review

•Stephen Della F.•Dec 5, 2025

CharterUP provided excellent transportation services for our wedding day. Their communication was easy and timely, making the booking process very convenient. The driver arrived on time to pick us up from a central location, and the transportation was effective and stress-free throughout the event. We appreciated CharterUP's professionalism and flexibility in helping to make our special day run smoothly.

  * ### CharterUp Review and Experience

•Verified review

•Morgan Earle (.•Nov 19, 2025

I booked a full-size coach bus through CharterUp to transport my 35-person wedding party between our hotel, photo location, and wedding venue. This transportation was an important part of our day, carefully planned so our entire group could travel together and share the experience. Unfortunately, our experience with CharterUp was extremely disappointing. The day before our wedding, I was contacted and told that the coach bus had broken down and that three 14-passenger mini buses would be sent instead. This was not what I booked or agreed to, and it completely changed our plans. I was told someone would follow up, but no one did—I had to reach out again myself, only to be told that no replacement coach bus could be secured. When I expressed that this was unacceptable and asked about compensation, I was told a claim could be submitted. Shortly after, I received another call saying that a coach bus had been located and that everything would proceed as originally booked. I trusted that the issue had been resolved. However, on the day of the wedding, the transportation that arrived was once again three small mini buses, not the full-size coach bus I contracted and paid for. This was a clear breach of contract and created unnecessary stress, confusion, and disappointment on one of the most important days of our lives. Because the mini buses did not have restrooms—unlike the coach bus we booked—we were forced to make an unplanned stop for a passenger who urgently needed a bathroom. This delay and disruption would not have occurred had the correct vehicle been provided. Overall, the experience felt chaotic and poorly handled. My husband and I lost the special shared moment we had planned and paid for, and the entire situation added stress to a day that should have run smoothly. After submitting a claim and providing evidence, CharterUp did issue partial compensation, which I appreciate. However, the refund does not change the fact that we did not receive the service we booked and that the mishandling significantly impacted our wedding day. I truly hope CharterUp improves their communication, reliability, and contingency planning so future couples do not experience similar issues.

  * ### Excellent service

CharterUP provided excellent communication throughout the planning process, making sure every detail was taken care of for our wedding day transportation. The service they delivered was nothing short of amazing - their drivers were on time, the vehicles were immaculate, and our guests were comfortable and able to enjoy the ride. CharterUP truly went above and beyond to ensure our wedding day was seamless and stress-free. I highly recommend them to any couple planning their big day!

### What if I need to change my itinerary or cancel my trip?

At CharterUP, we understand that sometimes plans change, and we’re here to help make any adjustments as smooth as possible.

### How do I pay for my charter bus rental? Is the full cost due at booking?

Once you’ve found the perfect bus for your trip and accepted a quote, you will be directed to a payment page to confirm your reservation. At that time, a deposit of 10% will be due to secure your booking. The confirmation screen will also show the date by which the remainder of the payment is due. We require a valid credit card to be on file to secure a reservation.

### Can alcohol be consumed on the bus during my trip?

Approximately 80% of our operators allow alcohol onboard; however, this can vary based on your destination and the regulations of each locality your journey touches. During the reservation process with CharterUP, you have the opportunity to specify that you’re seeking a bus that permits alcohol. We’ll then work to match you with an operator that accommodates your needs while ensuring compliance with all local laws.
