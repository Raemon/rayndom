•Mariann and M.•Dec 13, 2021

We can't say enough about how amazing Carte Blanche was at our event. Not only are they incredible musicians, but Kate the bandleader made everything so smooth from the planning process. She was very thorough and made sure everything went off without a hitch. They learned a few special songs for our ceremony and reception and put their own special touch on them to make it really special for us. They looked so glamorous and our friends and family are still telling us how unique they were, and couldn't believe how many languages the singer can sing in! This band is truly special and will elevate your wedding. Thank you Carte Blanche for an unforgettable night!
