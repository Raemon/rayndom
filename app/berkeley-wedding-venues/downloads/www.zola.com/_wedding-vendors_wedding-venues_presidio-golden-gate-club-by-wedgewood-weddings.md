## About this venue

The Golden Gate Club at the Presidio is a wedding paradise. The outstanding views of the Golden Gate Bridge make this site the envy of all San Francisco. A short hop from the Presidio Parkway, you and your guests will love this serene historic landmark with the best Bay views in the world. Choosing a wedding venue nestled within a celebrated state park unlocks unique photo opportunities. Your wedding will incorporate the Golden Gate Bridge, and we recommend posing on the Golden Gate Club deck for an exclusive viewpoint. You’ll enjoy the urban forests, sweeping lawns and manicured parade grounds before turning your attention indoors to celebrate among historic and traditional features.

  * ### Classic SF wedding? Look no further!

•Verified review

•Tracy S.•Apr 18, 2025

We had our wedding at the Golden Gate Club about a month ago. We used most of their preferred vendors, which we were more than pleased with. They offer "wedding planning" but I would say it's more so logistical, timing & day of planning, and the creative stuff is on the bride & groom - which worked perfectly for us! Julianna was great to work with. All of the staff was extremely responsive, which was very important to me. When jugging work, life & planning a wedding, receiving a response back same day (usually within an hour) was crucial to maintaining my sanity! Our guests are still raving about the day - the bartenders were cool, there were no awkward lulls in the day/good flow, the food was amazing & wow, what a beautiful setting. Pricing is transparent on the website, and you can add or take away any item to adjust for your budget. They can really do accommodate to any of your requests - you can make the day truly yours. If your love story has anything to do with SF, I HIGHLY recommend you check out the Golden Gate Club!

  * ### The Golden Gate Club is the Best! 

•Verified review

•Maggie G.•Dec 9, 2024

I can’t recommend The Golden Gate Club and their Wedgewood team enough!! THE BEST! The venue is located in a beautiful, quiet part of the city with several different ceremony locations offered within the venue (indoor Chapel, outdoor terrace with the trees surrounding you, or even inside one of the many rooms of the reception venue itself. It is so nice to be able to do both the ceremony and the reception in two different locations all within a few hundred feet of a walk from each other!! And with the large window in the main reception room we were able to get a beautiful view of the Bay and the Golden Gate Bridge while staying warm by the big beautiful fireplace! The Wedgewood team was amazingly helpful throughout the entire process and provided us with a guided planning book that helped us prepared for the several planning meetings/calls we had to make sure we were all on the same page with our vision for the day. Kaitlyn was amazing and patient as we worked through a few changes along the way. She was always very prompt in her responses when we had a question outside of any of our planned meetings. Kaitlyn was beyond helpful on the actual day of the wedding and kept the day running smoothly and making sure all the little details we discussed were executed perfectly. Thank you for everything, Kaitlyn! The Golden Gate Club also partners with amazing vendors and we have received so many compliments on the flowers, food, music, cake, bar, and general ambiance of the day. We were so happy with how everything worked out and how all the vendor teams worked so seamlessly together. The Golden Gate Club made our planning process and actual wedding day so easy and I would recommend this venue and team to anyone and everyone that is looking to get married in San Francisco!!

  * ### Amazing venue and amazing team!

•Verified review

•Jon and K.•Nov 13, 2024

We absolutely loved having our wedding at Wedgewood! The venue was perfect, and the staff absolutely made our experience amazing. Every interaction we had with the planning team were filled with excitement and warmth (shoutout Kennedy, Violet, and Juliana!). On the day of our wedding, the attentiveness to our needs and that of our family/guests, as well as the attention to detail as the night progressed was amazing. Setup of all our additional details (the welcome table/sign, table details such as the rally towel giveaways, and lawn games) were done perfectly. It was so amazing to be able to relax and just enjoy the wedding knowing that we could trust the team with all of those things! Kennedy was so extremely thoughtful making sure we were always taken care of. A few details that really stood out were: 1. She took a beautiful photo of us from outside and framed it! The photo is still up in our house to this day and is one of our absolute favorites. 2. She provided fun sunglasses for Kyla to wear, a detail she absolutely loved. 3. She caught on that we were excited about the kids meal when we were choosing the menu and brought us a plate during the wedding dinner. The happy face chicken tenders and fries were absolutely perfect so that we could take quick bites between pictures and speeches! 4\. Our siblings drunken speeches derailed the original timing of the program, but Kennedy rolled with the punches and proposed we change the format slightly to make everything fit. It absolutely worked and made the night flow so smoothly! DJ Quam was absolutely amazing as well! He pivoted seamlessly once we changed the format of the schedule, played music that hit the perfect balance of getting the older folks to dance as well as appealing to the younger crowd, and did an amazing job MCing and connecting with the crowd. This made us and all our guests feel hyped up and excited to celebrate. He made us feel like family and we're so happy we had him at the helm for such an important role in the night! Finally, the rest of the Wedgewood team were so great. All the feedback we got from our guests were that they had a great time and that it was one of their favorite weddings that they ever went to. The staff played a large part in it, making sure guests felt welcome, the setup was gorgeous, and the cleanup was timely. We also got several mentions that the catering staff were very accommodating to our guests and that the bartenders brought great energy so shoutout to them too! Overall we feel so extremely blessed to have such great people help make our big day go smoothly. It was an absolute dream and we're so happy that we decided to have our wedding with the Wedgewood team!

We had such an amazing experience planning our wedding with the Golden Gate Club team! They were all so easy to work with and so responsive, and our wedding coordinator Violet had such a great attention to detail! She made the planning process so fun and smooth and we were so thankful for her. Everyone made our planning process essentially stress-free, and we had such a blast at our wedding!!
