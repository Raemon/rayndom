Hello! I’m Daniel and I’m honored to be considered for your big day! From my home in sunny Sacramento, California, I work with couples to make their ceremonies memorable, meaningful to them and engaging for guests. I guide my couples through the planning process of the ceremony from brainstorming symbols of unity to ordering a copy of your wedding certificate from the county.

I have a big personality to match your dreams for your big day! You have plenty to plan already, so I do whatever I can leading up to and during your wedding to put you at ease and allow you to focus on enjoying the celebration of your love. someone who’s been around the officiant block more than a few times. Hiring someone who’s been around the officiant block more than a few times will make your day go off like the dream you had always hoped it would.

**In three words:** Collaborative, Fun, Thoughtful

  * ### You’re in great hands

•Verified review

•Dominic B.•Aug 3, 2025

Daniel was fantastic. At every step of the process he was a reassuring presence, he tailored the ceremony to our relationship, and helped us avoid pitfalls we definitely could have run into (like messing up our marriage license.) He’s not only a compelling officiant, but he makes everyone feel happy and at ease on what can be a really stressful day. Cannot recommend enough.

  * ### It was perfect!

•Verified review

•Esther T.•Jul 29, 2025

We couldn’t be happier with our decision to have D officiate our wedding. From start to finish, he was warm, professional, and incredibly thoughtful. He guided us through the entire process with ease, taking the stress out of one of the most important parts of the day. On the big day, D delivered a ceremony that was truly perfect. He thoughtfully incorporated the religious elements we wanted in order to honor and respect my parents' beliefs, seamlessly blended two different cultures and languages, and added a few nerdy, personal touches that made it feel uniquely us. We’re so grateful to D for helping create such a meaningful and memorable moment. Highly recommend!
