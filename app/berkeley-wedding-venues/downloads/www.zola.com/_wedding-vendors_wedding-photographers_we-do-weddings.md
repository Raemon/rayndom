Welcome to "We Do Weddings," where love meets artistry, and moments are forever preserved. We're Jared and Quinn, not just business partners, but a couple who share a deep passion for capturing the most cherished memories of your special day. Our journey into the world of wedding photography and videography began as a shared dream—a dream that brought together our love for storytelling, our appreciation for timeless elegance, and our fascination with the candid, unscripted moments that make every love story unique.

As a couple ourselves, we understand the significance of your day and the emotions that swirl around it. Our shared connection adds an extra layer of understanding and empathy, making you feel at ease knowing that we're not just photographers and videographers, but friends who genuinely share in your excitement. We don't believe in one-size-fits-all approaches. Your love story is as unique as the two of you, and we take the time to get to know you personally. We're not just interested in your wedding day; we want to know your love story—the quirks, the moments that made your hearts skip a beat, and the dreams that brought you together.

•Joyful Journey Engagement•Sep 26, 2023

As local wedding planning company, we can't recommend We Do Weddings for your photo and video team enough! They're the perfect balance of professional and approachable. Their top notch work speaks for itself, but what sets them apart is their knack for making couples feel at ease. We've had nothing but positive feedback from our clients about how fun and natural the experience was, even from the most camera shy individuals. Quinn and Jared are organized and dedicated to making each couple's experience memorable. If you want stress-free and beautiful photography and videography, We Do Weddings is worth every penny!

  * ### Made the entire experience easy 

•Verified review

•Jessy & B.•Sep 8, 2023

We had our engagement photos taken by We Do Weddings and had a great experience. My wife and I weren't set on a good location, but Jared and Quinn had a couple of suggestions and Freestone Park turned out perfect. They also arrived early and had a couple spots in mind to shoot at, which I really appreciated since it was a warm day and that expedited the process. The shoot was casual and surprisingly fun. They worked quickly but we never felt rushed. They gave great direction (including some pictures of what they were looking for at times) which turned out great. We just got the photos back and my wife and I were blown away. They turned out beautifully and we are so happy with them. The entire experience was a joy and the end result was exactly what we were hoping for.

  * ### Great People to Work With

## Frequently asked questions

7 Answers

Ask them a question

### Do you also offer video services?

Yes! Jared and Quinn work in tandem as photographers and videographers!

### Do you have insurance?

We do! Just let me know if your venue requires a certificate of liability, and I’ll send that over to them.

### How many pictures will we get?

You can expect about 50 images per hour of photographing. But keep in mind this estimate varies depending on your wedding package, number of guests, venue type, and other factors.

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

Turnaround time varies by season. Typically, you’ll be able to view your photos online about 4-8 weeks after your wedding.

### Can you accommodate special requests, such as drone footage?

Yes! We are Part 107 certified for drone operation.

### Do you have backup equipment in case of technical issues?

We have a backup for our backups...we always bring twice the equipment needed to our shoots! We also keep your photos in two places for years. In the "cloud" as well as on a fireproof harddrive.

### Can you describe your photography/videography style?

We specialize in natural light photography with a mix of classic and candid poses. Your photos will not only be timeless, but full of real, raw emotion!
