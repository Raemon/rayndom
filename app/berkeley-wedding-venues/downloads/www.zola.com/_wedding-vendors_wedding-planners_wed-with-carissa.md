•Gillian P.•Jan 10

We hired Carissa for day-of coordination at City Hall, and she was truly incredible. Even though our wedding was simple, her support made all the difference. She stepped in ahead of time to review details, coordinate logistics, and make sure everything felt organized and stress-free. On the day itself, Carissa handled everything seamlessly and kept things running smoothly, allowing us to fully enjoy such a special moment. Her calm presence and attention to detail gave us total peace of mind. She even held our 10 month old during the ceremony! We’re so grateful we had her by our side.

•Verified review

•Lauren•Jan 8, 2026

We hired Carissa for full wedding planning, and honestly, we don’t know how anyone plans a wedding without her. From the very beginning, she walked us through everything: guest lists, design choices, vendors, timelines, and all the little details we would have never thought of on our own. She was calm, thoughtful, and always one step ahead. On our wedding day, Carissa and her assistant handled everything so smoothly that we were able to relax and truly enjoy the day. We felt completely supported from start to finish.

## Frequently asked questions

5 Answers

Ask them a question

### Do you also plan other events, like showers or rehearsal dinners?

While I LOVE planning other events - my full focus at the moment are on weddings.

### How much time should we expect to spend with you?

Full wedding planning includes the most hands-on involvement. We’ll connect regularly throughout the planning process with scheduled meetings, ongoing check-ins, and unlimited phone and email support from the early stages through the wedding day. Partial planning offers structured guidance and check-ins around key milestones. I help with vendor introductions, meeting setup, and planning strategy, while you manage the day-to-day tasks independently. Day-of, I begin working with you one month before the wedding. During that time, we review details, finalize timelines, transition vendor communication, and prepare for a seamless wedding day.

### Do you take on multiple weddings in a day or weekend?

Nope — my team and I are fully dedicated to one wedding per weekend. Weddings require a lot of energy, focus, and attention to detail (and yes… they are wonderfully exhausting). By committing to just one celebration at a time, we’re able to show up fully present, well-rested, and ready to give your wedding the care it deserves.

### What happens if something goes wrong on the wedding day?

This is where experience truly matters. Over the years, I’ve handled everything from medical emergencies and sudden weather changes to traffic delays and last-minute timeline shifts. My role is to stay calm, assess the situation quickly, and adjust plans behind the scenes so the day continues smoothly. Most of the time, couples never even know an issue came up—and that’s exactly the goal.

### Can you work with our existing vendors?

Absolutely. Whether you’ve booked a few vendors or most of your team already, I’m happy to step in, review contracts, and take over coordination. I’m friendly, collaborative, and genuinely enjoy working alongside other vendors to keep communication smooth, timelines clear, and everyone aligned for a seamless wedding day.
