First and foremost, congratulations! This is an exciting time! Before I begin with all the details, I would like to do away with the formalities and keep it light. Technically speaking, I’m a photographer, but honestly, since establishing my business in 2014, I would consider myself a teammate through this process. I’ve really enjoyed getting to know couples, their families, their stories, and at the end of the day, becoming a good friend. If this vibes with you, we are off to a good start :) Answering questions, transparency in communication, and prompt responses are important to me and I hope that everything I share resonates.

I’m very active on social media so feel free to reach out to me. I mainly post wedding photos, travel photos, or silly videos. While I am a wedding photographer, I think all of that encompasses a lot of my personality and what I want to bring to the table for your wedding. For weddings, I put myself in your shoes. I am here to listen, accommodate, and be flexible with plans. Most weddings run a little bit delayed; a 5-15 minute delay does not change the way I run my business. In the end, if you are happy, I am happy and, truly, that is all that matters to me.

  * ### Amazing Photographer

•Verified review

•Kenta Y.•Jan 10

Justin was amazing to work with and my wife and I had a great time at our wedding with him as our photographer. He went above and beyond what we requested of him and always made it easy for us to pose and take pictures throughout our wedding while getting a few laughs out of us and our guests as well. We would highly recommend him to anybody looking for a photographer whether it be for a wedding or not.

Response from vendor•Jan 11, 2026

Kenta! Thank you so much! I had such a great time at your wedding! Thank you for allowing me to participate in your festivities! 😂😂😂 From our engagement session to the wedding, I am so grateful we had a chance to work together.

  * ### INCREDIBLE photographer Justin Kunimoto!!

•Verified review

•Michala H.•Jan 7, 2026

Justin felt like part of the family during our destination wedding in Mexico. After hiring him for engagement photos, we knew he had to be apart of our big day! Justin went above and beyond in every way, from bringing hand warmers to our engagement shoot (freezing spring weather), to offering pro-bono elopement photos with our grandparents, to gifting us surprise bachelorette photos the night before our wedding. Our guests and family LOVED him, and his work speaks for itself. His joyful attitude makes you feel so confident in front of the camera and you can truly tell he loves his job - which reflects in the photos! We feel like we've not only received the photos of our dreams, but gotten a friend in the process. 10/10 recommend Justin, especially for any destination wedding needs!!!

Response from vendor•Jan 9, 2026

Michala! Thank you for letting me part of your incredible day(s)!!! It has been a wonderful journey and being able to be included and witness the warmth of you two, your families, and friends! I will never forget the fun bachelorette photos! Keep poppin that champagne Queennnnn~!!! Congratulations once again! Much love and appreciation!

  * ### Incredible Photographer

•Verified review

•Eric W.•Dec 4, 2025

Justin is absolutely incredible! Kind, professional and the most warm person to have share in the many special moments of your wedding day, hiring him to be our photographer was the best decision we made. I couldn't speaker higher of him, his work speaks for himself, he is a true master of his craft!!!!

Response from vendor•Dec 5, 2025

Eric!!! It was such a pleasure to witness, celebrate, and photograph your wedding! I'm so happy everything worked out! You all are the best and I can't wait to continue celebrating with you two!

  * ### Best Photographer!!

•Verified review

•Shannon R.•Nov 21, 2025

Choosing Justin as our wedding photographer was truly one of the best decisions we made for our big day. He arrived early and immediately put us at ease with his easygoing and friendly attitude. Justin was incredibly efficient throughout the event—he captured all of the moments we requested plus so many more we hadn’t even thought of. Not only did he make sure to photograph us as a couple, but he also paid close attention to our guests, ensuring everyone was included in the memories. The sheer number of photos and the variety of angles he provided honestly made it seem like there were two photographers working instead of just one. We were blown away by how quickly Justin delivered our photos. Within just four days of our wedding, he sent us a stunning first look gallery of 300 photos. Justin was by far the best vendor we worked with—extremely responsive and attentive to detail. We can’t thank him enough for his hard work and the beautiful photographs we’ll cherish forever. If you’re looking for a photographer who goes above and beyond, look no further than Justin!

Response from vendor•Nov 23, 2025

Shannon! Glad I could be helpful for you all! Your wedding was so beautiful! I had so much fun! Thank you for letting me be part of your day!

## Frequently asked questions

12 Answers

Ask them a question

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically, couples book me about 8-18 months before their wedding date. I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible about my availability, even if you’re planning on a shorter time frame.

### Do you shoot with assistants or other photographers?

Typically, I photograph by myself. If you would like another photographer to be there to capture more moments, let me know. I can arrange for another photographer to be there for an extra cost. I have photographed 90% of my weddings by myself.

### Will you edit all our pictures?

Definitely! All final images will be edited for color, saturation, exposure, and sharpness to ensure they look beautiful.

### Do you also offer video services?

No, not a this time.

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

2-3 weeks after the event / wedding. Previews for social media will be sent within 1-2 days of the wedding.

### How many pictures will we get?

I deliver about 90 – 120 photos per hour. Based on recent weddings, probably more. But keep in mind this estimate varies depending on your wedding package, number of guests, venue type, and other factors.

### Do you have insurance?

Yes, I do have insurance on my equipment. In the event something breaks no one is held liable. My insurance will cover the damages. Also, many venues require a Certificate of Insurance (COI) as proof of insurance to be able to photograph at their venue.

### What’s your back-up plan if you can’t photograph our wedding as planned?

In my 10 years of experience, I’ve never cancelled. In the very rare event that I’m unable to shoot your wedding, I’ll make sure you’re covered by another photographer. I’ll also provide you with a list of photographers from the many networking groups I’m in, so you can find the perfect replacement. Any payments that have been made up to that point will be refunded.

### Do you do site visits?

Yup – please try to schedule a visit as early as possible – many of my weekends tend to get booked. If you decide a weekday, I thank you in advance!!! During the site visit, we usually go over rain plans, Plan B’s, and walkthrough the agenda of the wedding day while touring the venue. It’s super helpful for me.

### Can we see a full gallery of photos from a wedding?

Sure thing! Just let me know and I can send a few galleries depending on your type of wedding and location.

### Do you mind if guests take photos?

Nope! They are your friends and family! Whatever you say is a go! An unplugged wedding isn’t always necessary, but I do appreciate it when there isn’t a large iPad being thrown up during the ceremony 😛

### Do you take formal family portraits?

Absolutely! I think family formals are one of the most important photos of a wedding. These are the photos that will last generations so it is vital these be taken.
