Venue considerations

“The pricing on here is wrong. The venue fee alone is almost 30k. Then the food and beverage minimum is 50k but if you have 150 guests you will spend more like 80k. Plus there is a service fee of at least 13k. So BEFORE photographer, footwear, videographer, band, decor etc. you’re already at around 123k.”Jane, 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/stanly-ranch)

![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“My husband and I couldn’t have chosen a more perfect place to celebrate our wedding than Fairview Napa, CA. Our August 2025 wedding was everything we hoped for and more. From start to finish, the entire process was seamless and enjoyable. Valerie and Briana were incredibly supportive and patient, always quick to answer our questions and guide us every step of the way. Oscar was equally wonderful—kind, attentive, and informative. The entire team truly went above and beyond to make our vision come to life. Walking into the venue on the day of our wedding was such a breathtaking moment. Every detail we had discussed was brought to life beautifully—it was even better than we imagined. The team was so attentive, making sure we had drinks to stay hydrated and appetizers so we could actually enjoy a bite before the festivities began. Throughout the evening, everything ran flawlessly thanks to their professional coordination. We especially loved the open windows framing the gorgeous sunset—it added such a whimsical, romantic touch. The elegant draping created a warm, inviting atmosphere that tied everything together perfectly. Our wedding night was truly the best night of our lives, and we wouldn’t change a single thing. We are endlessly grateful to the entire Fairview team for creating such a beautiful, memorable experience. If we could, we’d do it all over again in a heartbeat.”Monica S., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/a772aa44-e868-47e7-a5bc-ceb96548bb94?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/fairview-napa)
