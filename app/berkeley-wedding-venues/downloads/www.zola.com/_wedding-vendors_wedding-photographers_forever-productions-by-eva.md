My name is Eva and I started my photography business in 2017. My love for photography and capturing people started since I was in middle school. My oldest brother gifted me a camera and I would take it everywhere with me. I began organizing and storing large digital files from my photographs and am really thankful to be able to look back and have such nice memories. I love showing people that they do not have to be professional models to look amazing together. My photography approach is emotional but also guided and directed. My business is diverse, inclusive, accepting, welcoming and a safe space for everyone.

I think something that sets me apart is being Latina, having a diverse cultural background and my ability to speak Spanish. I am someone who is will be flexible with change that happens throughout your day but will also be a great help with help to make decisions. With my wedding industry experience, I can help guide challenges in your planning and make suggestions that will be best for you and your partner's day. Couples spend their entire wedding day side by side with their photographer, so it's important to think about who that person is and how your family will respond to them as well.

## Frequently asked questions

8 Answers

Ask them a question

### Do you work with assistants or other photographers?

Sometimes, I’ll bring one or more assistant photographers depending on the size of your wedding. This would be an additional $100/hr fee.

### Will you edit all our pictures?

Definitely. All final images will be edited for color, saturation, exposure, and sharpness to ensure they look beautiful. I also offer retouching services like blemish removal and teeth whitening for an additional charge.

### How many pictures will we get?

You can expect about 80 to 100 images per hour of photographing. But keep in mind this estimate varies depending on your wedding day activities, number of guests, amount of details/decor, venue type, and other factors.

### Do you also offer video services?

No, I prefer focusing on photography only, so you can get the best wedding pictures possible. I would be happy to provide information on some local videographers I know.

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

My turnaround time varies by season. Typically, you’ll be able to view your photos online about 6 - 10 weeks after your wedding. The photographs are delivered through an online gallery for you to download and keep forever. Couples like ordering their prints through their online gallery because it's easy to do and are high-quality prints.

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically, couples book me about 13 months before their wedding date. I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible about my availability, even if you’re planning on a shorter time frame.

### Do you have insurance?

I do! Just let me know if your venue requires a certificate of liability, and I’ll send that over to them.

### What’s your back-up plan if you can’t photograph our wedding as planned?

In my 4 years of experience as a wedding photographer, I’ve never canceled a booking. In the very rare event that I’m unable to photograph your wedding, I’ll make sure you’re covered by one of my colleagues or my contracted assistant. I’ll also provide you with a list of photographers from the many networking groups I’m in, so you can find the perfect replacement.
