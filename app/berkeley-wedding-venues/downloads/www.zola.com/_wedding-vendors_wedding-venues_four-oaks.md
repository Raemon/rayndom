  * ### We Love Four Oaks! 

•Verified review

•Dania G.•Jul 6, 2025

The team at Four Oaks was a pleasure to work with for our wedding. They were supportive, attentive, and timely in their communication, and their kind, professional demeanor put us at ease throughout the planning process. The venue itself is ample, beautifully maintained, and well-kept, allowing us to bring our wedding vision to life without needing to add much decor. The owner was incredibly helpful, answering all our questions and ensuring our day was stress-free. Everyone in attendance raved about the venue and fell in love with the stunning natural setting. We were able to utilize outside vendors and it all was very smooth. We trusted Four Oaks fully, and they delivered an exceptional experience that exceeded our expectations. I would highly recommend this venue for any special occasion, especially an outdoor wedding.
