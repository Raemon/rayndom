  * ### Amazing!! 

•Verified review

•Melanie R.•Nov 14, 2025

From the moment we spoke with Angela, we knew we wanted her to be our photographer. She is incredibly friendly and responsive! We recently had our engagement shoot in NYC and she exceeded our expectations. Our pictures came out better than we could’ve imagined and she was such a joy to work with. Talking to her felt like talking to an old friend. We are so happy we found Angela and CANNOT wait for next year when she captures our wedding day! I’d hire her for any and all photo shoots if I could!

  * ### Angela is the BEST

•Verified review

•Alexy A.•Oct 26, 2025

I cannot express how amazing Angela was. She has not only a super warm personality. But also an amazing work ethic. I got the package for two photographers and they were both phenomenal. While I was getting ready(we are running about 30 minutes late) she was out taking photos of the venue, the lay flat photos, and the other details pictures. She even held onto our rings for me because the bridal suite was a wreck and I didn’t wanna lose them. All in all my experience with her was a 12/10 experience. She was one of the people who made my wedding less stressful!

Response from vendor•Oct 30, 2025

Aww, thank you SO much Alexy! We loved being part of your day! 💕✨

  * ### She captured every single detail we asked for!

•Verified review

•Katie•Sep 24, 2025

We absolutely loved having Angela as our wedding photographer! From our first chat, she was just the sweetest, kindest soul, and honestly it felt like having a friend with us all day. She truly captured every single detail we asked for, and then some! We were so blown away by how she managed to get all those little moments and special touches we talked about. Looking through our photos feels like reliving the magic all over again. Beyond her incredible talent she was just so genuinely nice and made us feel so comfortable and at ease. We couldn't have asked for a more wonderful person to capture our big day. If you're looking for someone who's not only super talented but also incredibly sweet and lovely to be around, we adore her and our photos!

Response from vendor•Oct 30, 2025

Thank you so much Katie!!! ❤️

We had the pleasure of working with Angela for our wedding and engagement photographs and I can't say enough about her incredible talent and artistic abilities. Her work is truly amazing, capturing moments with such beauty and precision. From the moment we started, she was thoughtful and organized, making the entire process smooth and enjoyable. She has a wonderful ability to make you feel completely relaxed and taken care of, which really shows in the final photos. I would highly recommend Angela to anyone looking for a skilled and professional photographer. Her dedication and passion for her craft are evident in every shot. Thank you for such a wonderful experience!

## Frequently asked questions

13 Answers

Ask them a question

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

You’ll be able to view your photos online about 8-10 weeks after your wedding. Within the first week, you will receive a sneak peek gallery with about 75 pictures!

### Will you edit all our pictures?

Absolutely! All final images are edited one by one for color, saturation, and exposure to ensure they are the best version possible!

### Do you also offer video services?

Yes, we do! Selections begin at $1400.

### How many pictures will we get?

You can expect about 75 to 100 images per hour of photographing. But keep in mind this estimate varies depending on your wedding package, number of guests, venue type, and other factors.

### Do you work with assistants or other photographers?

Sometimes, I’ll bring one or more assistant photographers depending on the size of your wedding. Don’t worry, this won’t cost you extra.

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically, couples book me about 6+ months before their wedding date. I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible about my availability, even if you’re planning on a shorter time frame.

### What is your photographic style?

I aim to capture timeless images that are romantic, elegant and authentic. I blend together both a light/natural look and focus on the details.

### Should we have an engagement session?

I love engagement sessions! Not only will you get beautiful images and create some new memories together, but you will also have the chance to see me in action and get comfortable in front of the camera before your wedding day. This is a great opportunity for us to get to know each other and for you to ask me questions about the big day!

### Do you work with assistants or other photographers?

I have a second photographer that I work with on a regular basis to capture alternate angles and precious moments in your day. They compliment me and work well to tell your story. I cannot physically be in two places at once, but by having a second photographer allows me to do just that. Wedding days are fast-moving and exciting so having that second photographer there to document it is essential.

### Do you have backup gear? And insurance?

YES and yes! These are two essential questions to ask each photographer you consider for your wedding day. I have backup cameras, lenses, and flashes to prepare me for whatever might happen. I also have liability insurance, which many venues require from vendors.

### How can I book you to photograph my wedding?

Your date is locked in when I have a signed contract and a 30% non-refundable deposit. please understand that I cannot hold a date through email inquiry. I receive many inquiries for any particular date in a season, and they are booked first come first serve.

### What's it like to work with you?

My guiding principle is to care for my clients. This is a beautiful but sometimes stressful part of your life. I will be organized and professional throughout the process so that you can relax with the confidence that your most meaningful moments will be captured. I create a relaxing experience that results in timeless and classic images that will cherish and reflect on for the rest of your life.

### What is your back up plan if your can't photograph our wedding?

In my 7+ years of experience as a wedding photographer, I’ve never canceled a booking. In the very rare event that I’m unable to photograph your wedding, I’ll make sure you’re covered by one of my associate photographers who have been directly trained by me.
