•Tiffani•Jan 10, 2024

Yesika was so warm and friendly. My husband and I are both a bit quiet and haven't been photographed professionally in a long time. We didn't really know what we wanted. Yesika really put us at ease and took charge while also seeking our input. I was nervous about this and she couldn't have been better. She delivers us High Quality digital photo album.

  * ### A Captivating Visionary

•Verified review

•Ashley and V.•Jan 9, 2024

Yesika Transforms Moments into Timeless Memories. We had the absolute pleasure of working with Yesika as our wedding reception photographer, and the experience was nothing short of magical. Hailing from Cuba and honing her craft in Spain and France, Yesika brought a unique blend of cultural richness and artistic flair that truly set her apart. From the very beginning, we knew we were in for something special. Despite her company being relatively new, our initial encounter with Yesika during our engagement photoshoot left us awestruck. Her ability to capture natural beauty and those fleeting, candid moments was unparalleled, prompting us to entrust her with the monumental task of documenting our wedding day. Yesika's journey to our rustic Farm in the Sierra Foothills showcased her unwavering dedication to her craft. Her keen eye for detail was evident as she effortlessly immortalized the blooming wildflowers and skillfully incorporated the mesmerizing sunset as a backdrop. The resulting engagement photos were a testament to her talent and left us with immeasurable excitement for what she would create on our big day. The wedding reception itself was a whirlwind of joy, laughter, and heartfelt moments, and Yesika was the silent maestro behind the lens, orchestrating a visual symphony that perfectly encapsulated the essence of our celebration. Her ability to narrate our story through her photographs was nothing short of remarkable; each image told a tale of love, excitement, and the sheer fun we experienced on that unforgettable night. Yesika's professionalism, coupled with her warm and friendly demeanor, made the entire process a seamless and enjoyable experience. She seamlessly blended into the festivities, capturing both the planned and spontaneous moments with equal finesse. Her passion for her craft and dedication to exceeding expectations were palpable throughout our entire interaction. Yesika, we not only gained a photographer but also an artist who transformed our wedding day into a collection of timeless memories. We wholeheartedly recommend Yesika to anyone seeking a photographer who not only captures moments but elevates them into works of art. Her talent, coupled with her genuine enthusiasm, made our wedding day all the more extraordinary, and for that, we are forever grateful. Thank you, Yesika, for turning our special day into a visual masterpiece!
