My approach to wedding photography and videography is to capture candid, natural moments that tell the story of the couple's special day. I believe that the best wedding photos and videos are those that are authentic and genuine, rather than overly posed or staged. To achieve this, I spend time getting to know the couple before the wedding day to understand their style, preferences, and personalities. On the day of the wedding, I try to blend into the background as much as possible, while still being present to capture the key moments and emotions.

  * ### Going Above and Beyond

•Verified review

•Jane•Jul 14, 2025

Wow! Where should I start?? We really couldn’t be more happy and pleased with Creative Cinema. We were looking for a photographer who was willing to cover our very small event – but would treat it as if was the most important thing he did – and we found Alex and his team. Honestly, videography wasn't even on our radar at first, but the price for the photo and video package was just too good to pass up. Plus, my dad really pushed for it, wanting a time capsule for the grandkids. And boy, are we glad we listened! Alex and the Creative Cinema crew were just awesome to have around – they seriously felt like part of the family. They made us feel super comfortable, were never once intrusive, and somehow managed to catch absolutely everything without making it feel staged at all. The photos turned out absolutely stunning, and the video? It honestly takes us right back into the moment. It's all so incredibly genuine, it's like we're reliving the whole day every time we watch it. Thank you, Alex and team, for this special moment!

Response from vendor•Jul 14, 2025

Thank you so much for the good words! It was such a joy to be part of your day. I'm so glad the photos and video brought all those special moments back. You two made it easy! Warmly, Alex.

•Trisha•Jul 3, 2025

We had such a great experience with Creative Cinema Photography and Alex. He photographed our wedding at Saratoga Springs and everything went so smoothly. From the start, communication was clear and easy. Alex was always quick to respond and helped us feel relaxed every step of the way. Our wedding included a traditional Asian tea ceremony, and Alex knew exactly what to do. It honestly felt like he was part of the family, like an uncle who just happened to have a camera. He captured every important moment without us even needing to explain. The photos turned out beautiful and natural, just how we hoped. If you want someone who knows what they're doing and truly cares, we highly recommend Alex and his team.

Response from vendor•Jul 14, 2025

Thanks, Trisha! It really felt like spending the day with family. It means a lot to hear the photos turned out just how you hoped!

  * ### Great Photographer, Outstanding Professionalism 

•Verified review

•Ulyana•Jul 3, 2025

We had the pleasure of working with Alex from Creative Cinema Photography for our wedding, and we couldn’t be happier with the experience. From the very beginning, Alex was incredibly professional, organized, and easy to communicate with. On the day of the wedding, he was punctual, calm, and blended in seamlessly while still capturing every important moment. His work ethic really stood out, he clearly takes a lot of pride in what he does, and it shows in the quality of the photos. We were so impressed with the final results and feel grateful to have these beautiful memories to look back on. We will definitely be recommending his services to friends and family in the future. Thanks again, Alex!

Response from vendor•Jul 14, 2025

Truly appreciate your kind words! It meant a lot to be there for such a special moment, and I’m thrilled the photos brought you joy.

Alex is a very talented photographer and an absolute joy to work with! We had the pleasure of working with him for our engagement and wedding photos. He was extremely professional and friendly. He captured the essence of our wedding day beautifully. His work is stunning and high quality. His artistic shots look straight out of a wedding magazine editorial. We would absolutely work with Alex again if given the chance.

Thank you so much! I had a great time capturing your day. It means a lot to hear this.
