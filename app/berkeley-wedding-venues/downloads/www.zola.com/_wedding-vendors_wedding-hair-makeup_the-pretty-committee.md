  * ### What a great experience!

•Verified review

•Bridal Shows of W.•Oct 17, 2025

Emily and her team were amazing partners at our recent Bridal Show. They handled multiple bridal models at one time, doing both hair and makeup in a busy and loud environment. She was timely, communicative, and friendly in the weeks leading up to the event, with patrons at the event, and in our conversations post-event as well. You will not regret working with her!

  * ### Phenomenal and talented team! 

•Verified review

•Kate M.•Oct 12, 2025

I wish I could give 10*, from my first impression of Emily the owner and her amazing team, I wish I could work with them for EVERY event! Professionalism, incredible work, and kindness and humility. They will go above and beyond and make your wedding memorable!

  * ### Stunning hair and make up

•Verified review

•Kathleen N.•Aug 26, 2025

The Pretty Committee was great to work with for my wedding hair and makeup. They were very responsive over email, which was helpful during the busy planning process. I appreciated that they were open to my ideas and let me make adjustments at each step, from the trial to the day-of. The team did a wonderful job getting me and my bridal party ready, creating looks that were beautiful and lasted all night long. Their professionalism and flexibility really made the beauty prep portion of my wedding day smooth and stress-free. I would highly recommend The Pretty Committee to any couple looking for a talented and accommodating beauty team.

  * ### The most incredible an unforgettable day! 06.21.25

•Verified review

•Destiny T.•Jun 23, 2025

The pretty committee and founder Emily Frew went above and beyond for my special day! From the very start the communication was incredible and reassuring. Being a busy bride was a breeze with quick responses and information at my fingertips from the team! I was honored to have Emily Frew for my bridal makeup and wedding party. Emily’s attention to detail and true passion for her craft does not got unnoticed. I could feel the love in every brush stroke from start to finish, trial to the big day! I am beyond grateful for the professionalism and care that was shown every step of the way! Emily Frew and the pretty committee went above and beyond to make our special day perfect. Emily truly enhanced my beauty from the inside out, while providing endless support and communication throughout the whole process. Emily even drove to my home for my wedding makeup trial after we shared the excitement of her opportunity in LA with amc. I’m so grateful and proud that we chose pretty committee and Emily Frew for our special day! Beyond beautiful and surpassed my expectations turning my dreams into a reality. My Bridal Party and I looked incredible! Thank you so much!!
