  * ### Professionals make everything easier

•Verified review

•Makai the Dj•Jun 18, 2024

Turntables are an amazing band and a lot of fun. You can tell they have experience in this industry and are great at what they do. Profesionalism makes everything easier because at the end of the day we all have the same goal and thats to make the wedding couple happy. TurnTables goes above and beyond to make this happen. Would highly recommend and always look forward to wprking with them again.

  * ### Wedding Music Group Review 

•Verified review

•Jennifer C.•Mar 19, 2024

TURNTables made our wedding reception a night we will never forget. We received so many compliments about the band. We had a 5 piece band and worked with Dasha and she was absolutely amazing, so easy! We had frequent communications, timeline reviews, site visits, music selection was superb and they even learned new songs at our request (long list of songs/genre that they are capable of performing), very professional (dress code at our discretion). Just pure 100% talent! They kept the energy up all night. Their production team was also top notch, making everything perfect! Thanks for being part of my special day!

  * ### Warm and memorable

•Verified review

•Dino T.•Feb 28, 2024

We booked this group based upon my learning about this band from a restaurant that the regularly perform at. It was memorable during the cocktail hour. Thankfully, everything was setup pretty nicely. They played our requested 90’s r & b and it was on point.
