## About this venue

On the southern edge of Napa Valley, the banks of the Napa River contour around the historic Stanly Ranch, where pristine vineyards blanket gently rolling hills that rise up to meet the wide-open California sky. Here, an extraordinary new luxury resort is taking shape. Stanly Ranch, a new destination in the heart of wine country, celebrates the romance of connecting with family and friends in a setting that’s steeped in winery estate tradition, inspired by the beauty of the land, and infused with a fresh, convivial spirit.

  * ### Wedding is minimum 150k

•Verified review

•Jane•Mar 14, 2024

The pricing on here is wrong. The venue fee alone is almost 30k. Then the food and beverage minimum is 50k but if you have 150 guests you will spend more like 80k. Plus there is a service fee of at least 13k. So BEFORE photographer, footwear, videographer, band, decor etc. you’re already at around 123k.
