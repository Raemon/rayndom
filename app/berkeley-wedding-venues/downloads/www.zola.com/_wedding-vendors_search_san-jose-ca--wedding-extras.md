BNG Worldwide Chauffeur Services 5.0 San Jose, CA

  * Transportation
  * Rentals
  * Starts at $750 

BNG Worldwide Chauffeur Services is a premier transportation company based in San Jose, CA, proudly serving the San Francisco Bay Area since 2014. Specializing in weddings and special events, BNG offers a luxury fleet of SUVs, sedans, and 27–56 passenger buses to suit every celebration. Whether it’s a one-way transfer or a full-day itinerary, BNG ensures every ride is on time, seamless, and elegant — delivering a VIP experience for you and your guests.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We booked BNG Worldwide Chauffeur Services for our wedding in San Jose, and they truly exceeded our expectations. From the first inquiry to the final drop-off, their communication was clear, professional, and responsive. We had an Executive Sprinter Van for the bridal party and a black SUV for family members. Both vehicles arrived early, spotless inside and out, and the chauffeurs were dressed professionally and extremely courteous. Our driver for the Sprinter (I believe his name was Sam) was especially great—he helped the bridal party in and out, managed time perfectly, and even had water bottles ready in the van. What stood out most was how stress-free they made the whole experience. They coordinated directly with our wedding planner for timing and route changes, which took a huge load off our shoulders. If you’re planning a wedding in the Bay Area—especially around San Jose, San Francisco, or Oakland—I’d strongly recommend BNG. They know how to handle weddings and treat everyone like a VIP.”Scarlet W., 6 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-extras/bng-worldwide-chauffeur-services)

*Dearest is not a photo booth. Dearest is a beautifully simple way to gather and preserve memories from weddings, showers, birthdays, retirements, and more. Guests share photos, videos, and heartfelt messages via a personalized QR code—after the event, so they can be fully present. Every package includes a private gallery to view, download, print, or turn into a curated photobook. We also offer printable QR code templates, signage, and display cards on Etsy, with 100% of profits benefiting Vow for Girls, a global movement to end child marriage. More than a guest book, Dearest keeps the joy, love, and laughter alive long after the celebration.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Me and my besties had a girls trip and we took SO MANY memorable photos. Instead of sending, sharing, remembering, etc., it was so easy for each of us to just post the photos to Dearest. Voila! Everything is compiled, organized and shared.
