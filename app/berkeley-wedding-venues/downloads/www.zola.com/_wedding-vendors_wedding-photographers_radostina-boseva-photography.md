Radostina (rhymes with “patina”) was born and raised in the coastal town of Varna, Bulgaria. After finishing her Master’s in Arts, she moved to the Czech Republic, where she began her career in graphic design, styling, and art direction. It was there, in the middle of her Czech adventure, that the passion for film photography was born. Now, an award-winning fine art wedding photographer, Radostina resides in San Francisco, with her husband Martin and their English bulldog, Fuji.

Radostina's timeless style is defined by her love for simplicity and minimalism, combined with the artistic use of clean lines and negative space. Favoring neutral tones, her work is emotive and organic, with a touch of romanticism and modernism. She frequently travels between the United States and Europe, crafting fine art images that are as elegant and as unique as her clients.

  * ### Eye for detail, amazing colors and professionalism

•Verified review

•M + R.•May 17, 2020

We are so happy that we chose Radostina to capture our special moment. Everything was smooth and contributed to the overall experience - from the initial contact to photographing the event to delivering the stunning photos. Radostina's attention for detail is second to none and her taste is impeccable, she gave us great ideas before and during the event on how to capture every moment in a way that we can preserve our memories. The colors, the captured light and the emotions on the pictures are just mesmerizing, probably because it was captured on film. We'd love to have Radostina capture another special moment for us in the future.
