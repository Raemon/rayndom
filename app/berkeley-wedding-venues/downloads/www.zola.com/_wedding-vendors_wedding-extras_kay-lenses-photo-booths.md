We had such an amazing experience. Kayla went above and beyond with designing the borders and setting up. She also did an amazing job making sure she everyone had fun with the photo booth and there where so many fun things to pick from. Thank you for such an amazing experience!!

  * ### Memories for everyone

•Verified review

•Nayeli•Oct 7, 2025

I hired Kayla for a surprise birthday party for my boyfriend. It was an intimate kind of party. I spoke with everyone and they all really loved it. It was super easy to get our videos afterward. On a sad note, a couple days after the event one of our dear friends at the party passed and this was the last time they were photographed/video recorded. I know everyone in our group has been replaying the videos, holding on to those last memories and seeing him smiling and happy. It was more than just a 360 video but a time capsule for all of us. Kayla was super easy to work with and kind and on time. The contract process was extremely easy and straight forward. If you’re looking to make your event memorable… DO IT! You absolutely won’t regret it. I can’t recommend Kayla enough.
