I communicated to them that I wanted to add video a few months out from my wedding and it was a stress free process. My husband and I are a bit awkward when taking photos and my photographer and videographer were so great in helping us get comfortable and trying different poses that made us less awkward in front of the camera. They both helped keep the energy high all throughout the night and my only regret was not hiring them for longer to capture things that had happened after they left. My bridal party and guests were telling me how great my photographer and videographer were. I just got my photos back and they are exactly what I wanted; Moody, slightly editorial with some candid moments. I can’t recommend Sound Originals enough and I will be recommending them to friends and family that are in need of a photographer/videographer”Hannah R., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/bb98a4c5-9a9a-4e14-b038-50702d371f0d?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/sound-originals-photo-video)

Specializing in Outdoor Weddings and Elopements! Growing up fishing and hiking at the age of three, I spend as much time as possible outside! Searching out new swimming holes in the summer, traveling to the mountains and along the coast throughout the year! Backpacking, hiking and climbing. Quickly adding more locations to shoot!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Justin really nailed it. He was flexible, easy to reach, and made us feel so comfortable in front of the camera. He has a gift for capturing both the big moments and the little details, and his candid shots feel timeless. Beyond his talent, he brought kindness to our guests and patience when challenges came up. I still get endless compliments on our wedding photos. If you’re looking for someone to capture your day perfectly, I couldn’t recommend Justin more.”Rhianna W., 5 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/7359e63d-f770-44a6-8731-ce518cb3a0e9?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/dustin-wheeler-photography)

I’m Carissa, a California-based wedding photographer specializing in true-to-color editing, candid documentary coverage, and natural, editorial-style portraits. My work focuses on real connection, emotional storytelling, and the in-between moments that define a wedding day. With more than a decade of experience, I photograph weddings with an intentional, relaxed approach that helps couples feel comfortable, authentic, and fully present. My husband, Tyler, joins me as our videographer, bringing the same warm, storytelling-driven style to every celebration.“We had so much fun on our wedding day with Carissa, Tyler, and team. Beyond having a blast taking photos, we felt comfortable and the direction given was so easy to follow. They really make you feel like a model! The photos Carissa gave us hang proudly on many different walls in our home, and the video Tyler made is always something we watch each year on our anniversary. Very special team, highly recommend!”Katie, 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/7fc297dd-801f-4fe1-9b7f-59414a8c4636?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/dream-capture-studios)

Born and raised in the Bay Area, I have a special love for being back there. I consider myself very outgoing and will always try and make you laugh and feel comfortable by being a huge dork. I think that is one of the biggest compliments I get is that my clients always feel relaxed and at ease and I love hearing that. Not to mention becoming friends with my clients which is an added bonus! ​“Hiring Jeff Hall as our wedding photographer was one of the first wedding decisions we made, and from there on out I knew everything was going to be fantastic. When meeting him for engagement photos, we all instantly hit it off and I knew he'd easy and FUN to work with. He's a photographer willing to go over and beyond to get THE perfect shot (wade through water, climb trees, shuffle through snow, lay in dirt. All of it.) The one thing I wanted at the end of the day was fantastic photos to look back on and hang in our home, and we received better photos than I ever dreamed of (and fast!). In fact, I loved him and the photos so much, I'm just counting down to when I can drag him to other countries for anniversary trips photoshoots! I'd recommend Jeff in a heartbeat to any couple!”Jordan & C., 5 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/jeff-hall-photography)

  * Starts at $1,000 

Captured Cupid is based out of Sacramento, California servicing clients from around the world. Primarily started as a wedding cinematography studio that specializes in storytelling style filmmaking. We love the challenge of producing such high-quality work for each individual because the emotional response is extremely rewarding for both our clients and our team. We would love to make introductions and chat with you about your wedding or special event.“Kevin was the best investment we made for our wedding. He went above and beyond for us. He stayed late at our wedding and gave us expert tips and tricks during our wedding to create a smoother event. The biggest problem I experienced during my wedding (and I assume most other do as well) was stress. Everything was flying at me and my then fiancé and the last person I expected to help comfort me and my wife and put our minds at ease was our videographer Kevin. He handled things with such ease and calmness. It honestly felt like he was the captain that kept out ship afloat. He’s more than a videographer. He helped organize and coordinate family/games/events during our wedding and truly did more than we could have ever asked for. Not to mention he even took incredible photos for us and had a entire edited album created for us the very next day. He displays the incredible professionalism and true care for his clients. I recommend his work to everyone and anyone. He is the best investment you could make for your most important day. My wife and I can’t thank him enough for what he did for us.”Mark & P., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/captured-cupid)

Could not recommend them enough and we will definitely be reaching out to them whenever we need an event captured again. Thank you again Connor & Emma!

  * Serves Roseville, CA

Hey, I'm so glad you're here! My name is Heather and I live in beautiful Foresthill, CA. I love any and all hard seltzers, my Great Dane Fritz, and using my camera to capture all the feels. About my business? Well I'm basically a professional wedding crasher, so you know you will always have fun with me! Oh and I've pretty much cried at every wedding I've ever been to...and yours is no exception. Let's be friends!“You can't go wrong with Heather. She and her team handled our engagement photos and shot our wedding. Both sets of pictures are incredible! She captured amazing moments of our wedding--and they match our memories perfectly. Heather's photos are stunning, but also feel authentic. Beyond her photography and editing abilities, she made us feel very comfortable. My wife and I aren't used to professional photoshoots (we are humble folk), so having someone so kind and down-to-earth made those experiences fun. Heather felt like someone we'd want to have at our wedding anyway! Hire her, have fun, and frame those prints.”Adrian J., 2 years ago![](https://images.zola.com/03391a15-99cf-4829-bd1e-846370130a58?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/heather-blackwood-photography)

Azaria Chavira Photography 5.0

  * Classic style
  * Serves Roseville, CA

Hi! I’m Azaria. I am a Northern California-based Travel Wedding and Elopement photographer. How did I get here? I grew up in small-town Nebraska with a love for adventure and photography. I got to explore those passions when I got married, my husband joined the military, and we got stationed overseas. I used that opportunity to travel and see many countries. When we returned stateside, I pursued my passion for photography by getting my degree at Brooks Institute of Photography.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Azaria! Where do I start when it comes to her and her as a photographer!? She genuinely has been phenomenal all the way around. Not just as a professional photographer but also someone who wants and gives her clients her 110% best and it absolutely shows! She's been insanely patient with me and very reassuring too. Although I am her client who booked her for our engagement photo's and wedding, I have to say there is not a single individual who could compare to the work she's provided. Her confidence, communication, professionalism and reassurance is definitely top tier!! I have total faith in her and what she does, that I wouldn't change a single thing or have it any other way! Her photo's are proof! Her personality is proof. She is so approachable but professional as well as understanding that it was very easy for me to gravitate to her. I know from the moment we had our phone consultation that I knew I just had to have her. Her photo's are gorgeous and the fact I can be so comfortable and be myself makes the photo's even better. Like think about it? If you can't have a client relationship with who your hiring as an important key to your day is it really worth it? Yeah there's a ton of photographers out there but Azaria, I dont regret her and her work for a single second. When she tells you it's about you and what you want what... she means that from the heart. Not to mention she's such a good hype person to have in your corner. I adore this woman so much and her work that I'm already planning on doing photo's with her for when my husband to be and I have our 1st wedding anniversary! She's got an eye for photography and a passion that runs deep in her heart! When I say I recommend her, I truly mean I recommend her without a single doubt!”Jennifer M., 8 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/ba40c658-9e0c-4ca9-a0ff-8c20c58cde37?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/azaria-chavira-photography)

I’ve had a camera in my hand since I can remember. On family vacations each of us had a camera and would come back with several rolls of film. It was great to see different perspectives of the same place. My photos became more refined throughout my childhood as I graduated to my stepdad’s Minolta film SLR. In college I dedicated myself to photography professionally with a degree in photojournalism, then found my calling with a wedding studio at 19.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Nikki from Nemus photography is a fantastic Tahoe-local and wonderfully talented artist. We have had the joy of doing a number of area events together over the years and Nikki truly delivers with amazing shots, beautifully edited images and we would highly recommend her to couples looking for an artistic, creative and professional photographer for their engagement shoot, wedding celebration, etc. Having done hundreds of Tahoe area wedding myself I will say that Nikki pours her heart and soul into her work and it shows. If you want a massively-talented photographer who knows the area, can tell your love story through beautiful images and is professional and timely than look no further.

Hello All! I'm Steph... A wife of almost 15yrs to the love of my life, a mommy to 4 wonderful kiddos, and a very passionate photographer that absolutely loves to capture life's most memorable moments! Elopements and weddings are my favorite to capture, they are life's greatest and most special moments that a couple will share together. These moments will be remembered for the rest of the couple's life, their love and commitment to one another, and embracing their future life together. Capturing those moments for each couple to look back at, and re-live those special memories, brings me such happiness.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Steph is the best.

She’s awesome. What’s important to me is a few things. 1 - fun to work with. It’s a serious team effort to rock a wedding. Everyone has to be positive and on point. 2 - guest interaction has to be upbeat and professional. The photographer communicates with the guests to line up the photos. This has to be done with a great attitude and with professional instruction 3 - photos have to look amazing. This is what it comes down to.

Lisa Richmond Photography 5.0

  * Classic style
  * Starts at $2,225 
  * Serves Roseville, CA

I’ve been capturing weddings, family lifestyle photography and casual portraits for more than a couple decades now working primarily in the Sacramento, Lake Tahoe, Napa, and San Francisco Bay areas, as well as all along the coastlines around San Diego and Coronado and everywhere in between. I’m inspired by outdoor adventures, travel, playful people, live music and amazing light and take advantage of any opportunity to capture raw emotion and natural beauty away from home.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“This post is delinquent by a couple months, but we wanted to share our memorable experience utilizing Lisa Richmond Photography. I saw Lisa Richmond's art for the first time in the fall of 2014. Lisa photographed our dear friend's wedding in Winters, CA. So, when Linda and I became engaged in 2015, we knew immediately who we wanted to record our engagement and wedding day on 9/23/16. Luckily, Lisa was available!Prior to meeting Lisa for our engagement photos, we had chatted on the phone a couple times so Lisa could get an idea about Linda and my love story. She was very easy to talk with and we had several good laughs before meeting in person. I told Lisa that neither Linda or I cared to have our pictures taken so I wished her luck with that! Lisa knew we planned on getting married at a winery and she suggested we bring a bottle of wine to open during our engagement shoot. After sharing some wine and stories together, she started working her magic. Lisa made the shoot fun and effortless so the pictures looked natural. Her use of light and her timing are phenomenal. She caught our relationship and personalities digitally!Finally, our long-awaited day came! When Lisa arrived at our wedding, we greeted her as a friend and not just a photographer, since a friendship formed between all of us. Lisa captured every moment of our special day and more. She roamed the vineyards with us to obtain the perfect sunset moments, and she was knocked around on the dance floor like a pinball by some guests getting their groove on...just so she could seize our moments! We were delighted by Lisa's artistic eye, professionalism, and her great personality. We will definitely utilize her for future gatherings as well as share a glass of wine when possible! We highly recommend Lisa if you want to beautifully capture your special occasion.”Kelly Roberts, 4 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/lisa-richmond-photography)
