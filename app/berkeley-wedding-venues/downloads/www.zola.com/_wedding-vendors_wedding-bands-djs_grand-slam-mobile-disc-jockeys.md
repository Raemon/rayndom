Macki Event Services was a fantastic choice for our wedding band and DJ. Their communication throughout the planning process was quick, comprehensive, and assuring.

  * ### Fantastic Wedding DJ - Highly Recommend

•Verified review

•Kevin L.•Sep 29, 2025

DJ Macki was an absolute pleasure to work with for our wedding! From our very first interaction, he was kind, easy to talk to, and collaborative in helping us shape the music and entertainment for our big day. His communication was excellent, and he was incredibly reliable in executing everything we asked for. He played a custom audio file for our first dance exactly as requested, and he seamlessly incorporated a specific song segment for our grand entrance. For the post-dinner music, we gave him flexibility, and he did an amazing job reading the crowd and creating the perfect vibe and energy throughout the night. The sound quality was fantastic, and everything felt professional yet personal. We would highly recommend Macki Event Services to any couple looking for a talented, professional, and affordable wedding DJ.

  * ### Seriously The Best!

•Verified review

•Kelly H.•Mar 31, 2025

I don't know where to begin but I do know that Chuck was an incredible DJ who really made our whole wedding. We hired him not knowing anything about his company and soon realized why he has so many incredible reviews here and on google. H e went above and beyond to insure our wedding day was flawless. The planning and organizing was perfect and the announcements were well handled and then the dance portion was simply amazing. The way he read the room and played the perfect song at every moment and had all ages out on their feet singing and waving their hands all night. I t was truly magical to see both our families together on the dance floor the WHOLE NIGHT!!! Dont even look at any other companies send him a message and hire him now! TRUST ME!
