![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Scribner Bend Vineyards was one of the last wedding venues that we toured in March of 2024, and the moment we walked the beautiful grounds and got a feel for the flow of how our wedding day would look, we knew it was the perfect venue for us. We were luckily enough to lock in a Saturday in October of 2025. We not only fell in love with the natural beauty of the property, but we were impressed by how kind and welcoming all of the staff were (Shaye at the time and then Hillary), greeting us with their amazing signature almond champagne. Since we had over a year to plan our wedding, we were able to attend 2 wedding open houses hosted at Scribner Bend and the staff greeted us so warmly, remembering our names and making us feel right at home. We also got to know some of their incredible preferred vendors such as Jackie’s Flowers, Rain from Paesanos Catering, and the Elegant Events Media Team. They continued to be great to work with, super communicative, flexible, and open to any and all ideas that we had to execute our wedding vision flawlessly. Leading up to wedding day and at our rehearsal practice, the day of coordinator, Hillary, was so great and organized, making us feel at ease and confident for anything that wedding day could throw at us. Scribner Bend Vineyards could not have been a more stunning wedding venue. The Bungalow was a great spot for getting ready and it was so fun to hang out with the girls and watch the guests arrive through the window on the upper level of the house. The vineyard was absolutely gorgeous, golden hour in the vineyard was dreamy, guests loved all of the various seating areas throughout the whole night to chat with family and friends. The food was so delicious and well organized. The staff was all so friendly and accommodating (Hillary brought champagne for us after we walked back down the aisle before we escaped for our sunset photos, the Paesanos catering team fixed us plates of appetizers and dinner and set up our sweetheart table with everything that we needed). Our grand entrance through the barn doors onto the dance floor with the guests circled around the hedges was a major highlight, and the fountain filled with flowers was picture perfect. It has meant the world to us to hear that so many of our guests who attended our wedding have been telling us that it was the best wedding that they have ever been to. Overall, we would so highly recommend Scribner Bend Vineyards for anyone, we would 1000% get married here again. We will be recommending it to all of our friends in the hopes that one day we will get to be the guests at such an awesome wedding venue. Will add more pictures of the venue itself on our wedding day once we get more professionals back :)”Kirk and E., 2 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/310ada92-520c-494d-accf-a8f21bdf8400?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/scribner-bend-vineyards)

“We were thrilled with our wedding venue at Elks Tower Events. Throughout the planning process, Sabrina and her team were extremely responsive, answering all our questions promptly and helping guide us through decisions with their expertise. On the big day everything came together beautifully - the ballroom looked gorgeous with the lighting and decor, and all the behind-the-scenes coordination went off without a hitch so my husband and I could relax and enjoy celebrating with our guests. Having the catering and day-of coordination included in the venue package was such a help. We truly appreciated Sabrina and the Elks Tower staff making our wedding day stress-free and magical in their lovely, all-inclusive venue. It was a beautiful 'one stop shop' that exceeded our expectations. We highly recommend them!”Jennifer K., a year ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/elks-tower-events)

![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“One of the best decisions we made during our wedding was choosing Revival at the Kimpton Sawyer for our cocktail reception. The rooftop setting was nothing short of stunning—elevated high above the heart of Sacramento, it created an effortlessly chic and elegant atmosphere that wowed our guests from the moment they arrived. The Revival team was outstanding—attentive, professional, and incredibly accommodating. From the seamless setup to fulfilling every special request, their service exceeded all expectations. They worked closely with us to curate a custom cocktail menu that was both inventive and crowd-pleasing—every drink was a hit! The food was equally impressive, with beautifully presented passed appetizers and flavorful small plates that kept guests raving all night. Whether you're planning an intimate celebration or a vibrant event under the stars, Revival delivers an unforgettable rooftop experience. It’s the perfect blend of style, service, and skyline views!”Isha P., 8 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-kimpton-sawyer-hotel)

“Estate Farms is a very beautiful venue. You can do so much with it. I hosted my wedding here in October of 2025 and loved it! Eugene, the owner, is very communicative and was great to work with. Any time I had a question, he would text back right away. Really great guy. The only complaint I have is that the day of my wedding, all the bathrooms broke down and had to direct people to the farmhouse. We let the owner know, he was on the premises, but unfortunately, nothing was done. It was disappointing, but I am very happy with the overall experience. Would book again.”Sammy A., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/4d44a309-06ad-401b-8d66-501b37b0f66f?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/estate-farms-llc)
