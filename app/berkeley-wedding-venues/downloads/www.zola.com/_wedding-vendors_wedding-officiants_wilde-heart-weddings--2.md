From our first interaction, Wilde Heart Weddings demonstrated a truly professional and punctual communication style. They were incredibly responsive and kept us informed every step of the way in planning our ceremony. On the day of our wedding, their work was nothing short of amazing - the ceremony they officiated was beautiful and elegant, and truly made our special day feel even more meaningful. We could not have asked for a better partner to help make our wedding the best day of our lives. We highly recommend Wilde Heart Weddings to any couple looking for a top-notch officiant who will go above and beyond.

Jenn was so wonderful and communicative, she answered any questions we had and helped to ensure that we had all we wanted in the ceremony. The day of the ceremony she was such an awesome calming presence, we were so grateful for her!
