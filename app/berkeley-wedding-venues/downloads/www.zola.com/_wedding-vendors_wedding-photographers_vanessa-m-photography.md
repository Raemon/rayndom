Follow me on Instagram *vanessamontanophotography I’m Vanessa—Bay Area born and raised, living my dream under the California sun with a camera always close by. When I’m not documenting life’s beautiful moments, I’m likely in the kitchen testing new recipes, catching up with friends over a dirty martini, cruising with country music turned up, or spending time with my family. Photography isn’t just my work—it’s something I truly love. I feel incredibly grateful to witness and capture so many meaningful stories.

I blend natural light, genuine candid moments, and an editorial touch to create images that feel both effortless and cinematic. Your wedding gallery will tell your story with emotion, beauty, and a timeless feel you’ll treasure for years to come. 😄

  * ### Timeless, Stunning Memories

•Verified review

•Kennedy M.•Dec 16, 2025

We are so happy we had the opportunity to have Vanessa capture our special day! The quality of her work is exceptional, with beautiful colors and candid moments filled with love. Vanessa constantly checked in to make sure we got the shots we wanted, and went above and beyond to focus on capturing the special interactions between our family and friends. We couldn't be happier with the final photos - they truly helped make our special day even more memorable.

  * ### The very BEST!

•Verified review

•Dina M.•Jan 5, 2025

From start to finish, working with Vanessa was an absolute dream. We knew our wedding photos would be important, but the moments she captured completely exceeded all of our expectations. From the very first consultation to the final delivery of our images, every step of the process was seamless, professional, and filled with care. On the day of our wedding, Vanessa was not only incredibly skilled but also a calming and positive presence. They blended into the day perfectly, capturing candid moments without ever being intrusive. The photos are a perfect mix of breathtaking portraits and those spontaneous, emotional snapshots that tell the story of the day. From the laugh-filled getting ready shots to the tender first look, every photo is a work of art. Thank you Vanessa for giving us the gift of such stunning memories — these photos are treasures we will cherish forever!

Response from vendor•Dec 17, 2025

Thank you from the bottom of my heart for such a thoughtful and generous review Dina. It was truly an honor to document your wedding day and to be entrusted with moments that mean so much to you. I’m so grateful to hear that the experience felt seamless and supportive from start to finish, and that the images reflect both the beauty and the emotion of your day. Capturing those quiet, joyful, in-between moments is what I love most, and knowing these photographs will be cherished for years to come means everything to me. Wishing you both a lifetime filled with love, laughter, and beautiful memories 🤍

I’m glad the communication and attention to detail made you feel supported and cared for on such an important day.

  * ### Great to work with!

•Verified review

•Paula Z.•Jan 25, 2024

I got married in Napa Valley and didn't know who to hire for my professional pictures. The venue recommended a few names and after contacting Vanessa I knew that is who I wanted to work with. She was very caring and patient. She was on time and didn't disrupt the moment when I was getting ready, instead she made it special. She gave us poses to do and talked to the venue to make sure we could go to a little bridge I wanted to take pictures at. I highly recommend her!!

Response from vendor•Dec 17, 2025

Thank you so much for your thoughtful review, Paula. It was such an honor to photograph your Napa Valley wedding, and I’m truly grateful your venue connected us. Creating a calm, supportive experience—especially during those meaningful getting-ready moments—is always a priority for me, and I’m so glad it helped make your day feel even more special. I loved working with your venue to capture portraits at the bridge you envisioned, and I’m thrilled you’re happy with the experience and images. Thank you again for trusting me as your Napa Valley wedding photographer and for the heartfelt recommendation.

## Frequently asked questions

9 Answers

Ask them a question

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically, couples book me about 6-18 months before their wedding date. I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible about my availability, even if you’re planning on a shorter time frame.

### Do you work with assistants or other photographers?

Sometimes, I’ll bring one or more assistant photographers depending on the size of your wedding. Don’t worry, this won’t cost you extra.

### Will you edit all our pictures?

Definitely. All final images will be edited for color, saturation, exposure, and sharpness to ensure they look beautiful. I also offer retouching services like blemish removal and teeth whitening for an additional charge.

### Do you also offer video services?

No, I prefer focusing on photography only, so you can get the best wedding pictures possible.

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

Typically, you’ll be able to view your photos online within 6 weeks after your wedding. Within this time, you can also expect to receive a sharable link with high-resolution image files, so you can share the photos with your loved ones and order prints.

### How many pictures will we get?

You can expect about 80-100 images per hour of photographing. But keep in mind this estimate varies depending on your wedding package, number of guests, venue type, and other factors.

### Do you have insurance?

I do! Just let me know if your venue requires a certificate of liability, and I’ll send that over to them.

### What’s your back-up plan if you can’t photograph our wedding as planned?

In my 10 years of experience as a wedding photographer, I’ve never cancelled a booking. In the very rare event that I’m unable to photograph your wedding, I’ll make sure you’re covered by one of my colleagues or my contracted assistant. I’ll also provide you with a list of photographers from the many networking groups I’m in, so you can find the perfect replacement.

### Are you fun and outgoing?

Heck yeaaaaaaa! I love to have a good time and I love making my couples feel at ease on their wedding day. I have an easygoing personality that my couples love.
