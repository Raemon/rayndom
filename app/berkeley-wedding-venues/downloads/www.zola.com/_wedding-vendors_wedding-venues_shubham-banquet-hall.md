  * ### Unforgettable 25th Anniversary at Shubham Halls!

•Verified review

•Vikas M.•Mar 5, 2025

We recently celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary at Shubham Halls, and we couldn’t have asked for a better venue! From start to finish, the entire experience was seamless and truly exceptional. A huge shoutout to Manoj, who coordinated everything to absolute perfection! From the drinks menu to the décor, food, and every tiny detail, he ensured that everything was executed flawlessly. His professionalism, attentiveness, and dedication made all the difference, allowing us to simply enjoy our special day without a single worry. The venue itself is stunning, with elegant décor, ample space, and a warm ambiance that set the perfect tone for our celebration. The catering was phenomenal, with a delicious spread that our guests couldn’t stop raving about. The food was fresh, well-presented, and customized to our preferences, making the dining experience truly delightful. A special mention to DJ Ellis, who absolutely rocked the night! His energy, music selection, and ability to keep the dance floor alive made the party an absolute blast. The dance floor was electric, and our guests had the time of their lives dancing the night away! A big thank you to Hugo for crafting amazing drinks that kept the spirits high throughout the night! His skill and creativity behind the bar made the experience even more special for our guests. A huge thank you to Arunji, Sunilji, and the entire team at Shubham Halls for making our silver jubilee celebration a grand and unforgettable affair! We highly recommend this venue for any special occasion—it’s simply the best!

  * ### Traditional baby shower 

•Verified review

•Pradheep•Mar 3, 2025

We recently hosted a traditional baby shower at Grand Event Hall, and it was a wonderful experience from start to finish. The venue itself is spacious, has ample seating and very well-maintained. The staff were professional and accommodating, ensuring that everything ran smoothly. A special thank you to Arun and Manoj who were very responsive to our needs and helped with setup and logistics. The live stream feature in the hall allowed our friends and family who couldn’t attend in person to be part of the celebration. It was a huge plus and really made the event feel more inclusive. Overall, Grand Event Hall provided an excellent experience, and we would definitely consider using it again for future celebrations!

  * ### Amazing event at Shubham Hall

•Verified review

•Amol•Feb 2, 2025

We booked "The Grand" at Shubham Hall nearly three months ago for our event. Initially, we visited and explored all three halls. Each hall is spacious and can accommodate a good number of guests. Since our party was large, we opted for "The Grand." All the halls come equipped with LED back screens, dance floors, AV systems, tables, chairs, and—most importantly—delicious food. After our visit, we met Mr. Arun, who was very accommodating and discussed our requirements in detail. He provided comprehensive information about the rates, package inclusions, and other details. We took about a week to decide, as we were considering three other venues. After doing all our calculations and weighing our options, we made the decision (obviously for what best suited us)… Haha! Once we booked, a WhatsApp group was immediately created, and the journey began. A dedicated coordinator, Mr. Manoj, was assigned to guide us through every step: 1\. Floor planning 2\. Decoration 3\. Food menu (with complimentary tasting, by the way) 4\. Dedicated servers From booking to the event day, everything went smoothly, thanks to Shubham Hall and their amazing team. I couldn’t have asked for a better experience—we'll definitely be back!
