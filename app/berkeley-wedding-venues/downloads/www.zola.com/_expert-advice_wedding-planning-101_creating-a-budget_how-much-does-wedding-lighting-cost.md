Wedding lighting costs vary greatly, but you can expect to spend between $200 and $5,000 on lighting, depending on where you are getting married and how much lighting will be required. Bare bones rustic venues, for example, may require more lighting, while other venues may require you to work with a lighting specialist to help bring your vision to life for your special day.

But remember: This isn’t a place to skrimp. Wedding lighting can be a crucial part of setting both the mood and ambiance for your ceremony and reception. Not to mention, it’s for guest’s safety, so they can see at night.

From twinkle lights, to uplighting, to gobo and marquee, you have plenty of options when it comes to lighting for your big day. Here’s more information about how much wedding lighting costs, depending on which route you choose:

### Ceremony Lighting

For a sunset or nighttime ceremony, you’ll want to make sure all walkways and event spaces are properly illuminated, so guests can see where they’re going at all times. To get the job done, you can purchase a set of eight LED walkway lights for around $200, plus the cable and transformers to set it all up.

Aesthetically speaking, you may want twinkle or other string lights to set the magical mood for your ceremony, too. These are generally fairly budget-friendly, priced around $17 to $20 for a string of around 200 LED lights, plus the cost of supplies, like hooks or other hanging equipment, if you are supplying these yourself. You may also need to pay for labor costs to have these supplied, hung, and set up for you.

### Venue Lighting

Speak with your [wedding venue](https://www.zola.com/wedding-vendors/search/wedding-venues) about lighting that may already be in place. Then ask your [venue coordinator](https://www.zola.com/expert-advice/a-wedding-coordinator-checklist) or wedding planner if they work with a lightning specialist who can supply you with a quote for your wedding day. Below are some examples of lighting you may want for an indoor or outdoor venue.

### Uplighting

Uplights add a pop of color and a dramatic effect to any ballroom or restaurant venue. Expect to pay between $600 and $2,000 for uplighting in a large ballroom. If you want to save some money, you can scale back, by choosing to feature uplights in certain areas, like the dance floor or wedding cake table.

### String Lighting

Having the right string lights for your big day can create the warm, festive, and romantic atmosphere you’re after. There are many different types of string lights, including twinkle lights, Edison bulbs, paper lanterns, and fairy lights. Most typically cost between $3 and $5 per linear foot, but you may need to pay more for the cost of installation and any extra equipment, like extension cords.

You may also want to install chandeliers for a romantic and glamorous look. Expect to pay between $150 and $500 for these, plus the cost of labor to install them.

### Gobo Light

A custom gobo light can project your names, initials, and/or wedding date onto the dance floor. These typically cost between $150 and $300. Your deejay may even offer a custom gobo light as part of their music package, or your venue or wedding coordinator may be able to set one up for you.

### Marquee Lights

Marquee lights/letters in your initials or another fun saying, like “XOXO” or “LOVE,” are a fun way to add some extra lighting to your event. They also make for great photo opps. For custom marquee letters, expect to spend between $50 and $300. If you’re on a tighter budget, you can also find recycled marquee lights on sites like Facebook Marketplace for around $25.

### Spot Lights

Your deejay or band may provide their own spotlights for your first dance or include dance floor lighting as part of their package, but if you or your venue needs to supply a spotlight, expect to pay between $30 and $100 for the evening.

### Other Lighting Costs

Other lights you may want—or need—include:

  * Texture lights: $50 to $200 per light fixture
  * Centerpiece lights: $10 to $30 per table
  * Pin spot lighting: $20 to $45 per table
  * Pendant lights: $15 to $25 each



### Labor Costs

Don’t forget to account for any additional costs associated with the labor of assembling, setting up, and taking down lights at your event. Your venue may require a lighting specialist to install custom lighting or even a specialized electrician to make your lighting vision come to life. Work with your venue and wedding coordinator to verify the labor costs and review all contracts with regards to lighting for your big day, so everything can shine on as planned.
