  * ### The perfect day

•Verified review

•Emily A.•Jan 27, 2025

From start to finish, the sales team and the food and beverage catering team was amazing. Erika from sales helped us plan and pay for our wedding and she was very attentive and explained everything in full detail. The food and beverage catering team was great and they checked on us and our guests throughout our time in the reception. The food was wonderful and the hall was so beautiful.
