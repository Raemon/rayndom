  * ### Perfect Fall Wedding 

•Verified review

•Marcella T.•Dec 17, 2025

Fairview Metropolitan was an absolute dream to work with for our wedding. From the very first interaction, the staff was professional, friendly, and made the entire planning process truly enjoyable. Angela and Trish in particular were so helpful and attentive - they even helped me with my dress before I walked down the aisle when it kept getting messed up. The venue itself was memorizing, with an elegant and peaceful atmosphere that felt absolutely gorgeous. The massive space was the perfect backdrop for our special day, and we couldn't have asked for a more stunning setting. I love Angela and Trish, and I hope I have the chance to work with them again in the future. Fairview Metropolitan truly helped make our wedding day one we'll never forget.

  * ### October 2025 Wedding

•Verified review

•Melissa L.•Oct 31, 2025

Angela was an absolute pleasure to work with for our wedding. Her communication was clear, thorough, and timely, and demonstrated a deep knowledge of the venue and wedding planning. She always answered our questions promptly and with professionalism. The Fairview Metropolitan team set up everything smoothly and seamlessly. Chairs and other furniture were moved without guests being bothered. Appetizers and drinks were delicious. Guests commented on how yummy everything was. The space itself is beautiful, spacious, and tranquil, providing a clean and undisturbed setting for our special day. The golfers and airplanes were present but that didn't bother us. We couldn't have asked for a better venue and staff to make our perfect wedding day!

  * ### Tour this venue now! 

•Verified review

•Carina•Sep 18, 2025

We had our wedding at Fairview Metropolitan, and it was everything we could have hoped for and more! The real star of the day was our incredible wedding coordinator, Trish. From the moment we started planning to the very last dance, she went above and beyond to make sure every detail was perfect. She kept us calm, handled everything behind the scenes, and made the entire experience so seamless that we were able to simply enjoy our wedding day. Trish is truly the reason we had our dream wedding, and we cannot thank her enough for the care, dedication, and heart she put into making it all happen. Our families and guests were blown away by how beautiful, organized, and smooth the entire celebration was. Everyone was so impressed with the venue, and we received endless compliments throughout the night. On top of that, the food was absolutely delicious — huge shout out to Chef Maria and staff. Fairview Metropolitan gave us the most unforgettable day, with a level of service and quality that far exceeded our expectations. The best part? It was affordable for the value we received. We couldn’t recommend this venue, and especially Trish, more highly for anyone planning their wedding.

  * ### Book Fairview Metro You won't regret it!!!

•Verified review

•Tara W.•Aug 1, 2025

I had my wedding here at Fairview Metropolitan and it was the MOST AMAZING DAY EVER! For starters Angela Muse helped us from start to finish on planning our day and every little detail in between! She was amazing to work with, she was clear, communicative, friendly and organized which is everything you want when you are planning your wedding! When I arrived at my reception I was blown away by the decor and how beautiful every detail was! Thank you so much Angela for all of your hard work and support in making my dream reception!!! The vendors that are connected to Fairview that I opted into having was DJ Keel and Ting at Montclair Florist. DJ Keel was a phenomenal MC and met with us ahead of time to get an idea of how we wanted our wedding MC'd as well as what we wanted our music to be like and let me tell you he achieved it!!! My guests were laughing, entertained and raving about the music all night! Thank you Dj Keel! I coordinated with Ting from Montclair Florist and although we did not talk much I have to say my bouquet and center pieces were the most beautiful flower arrangements I have ever seen! The flowers were stunning and she ran with the ideas I had and made it the most beautiful arrangement ever!! My guests were raving about the food and we were so supported by KeeKee our Banquet Manager! She checked in on us and made sure we were good throughout our reception! Book with Fairview you will not regret it the venue is beautiful and open, the tented pavilion is gorgeous, the food is delicious and the staff are phenomenal!!! Thank you Fairview for making the reception of my dreams!!!!
