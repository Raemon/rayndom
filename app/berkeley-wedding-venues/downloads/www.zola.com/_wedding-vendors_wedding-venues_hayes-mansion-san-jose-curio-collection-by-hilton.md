## About this venue

The Hayes Mansion is a luxurious wedding venue located in beautiful San Jose, California. Steeped in tradition and rich history, the historic estate has been creating memories for over a century. With lush, emerald green lawns accented by vibrant gardens, the once lavish private estate has been refurbished into a luxury hotel and resort. With 214 guest rooms, the types of event spaces that are offered include both indoor and uncovered outdoor settings, all with a classic and vintage style. Hayes Mansion is available for bridal showers, engagement parties, ceremonies, and wedding receptions. We also provide a private dining space for rehearsal dinners. The catering options include banquet libations, breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, and desserts. The talented culinary staff will ensure that every detail is in place so that you and your guest can enjoy the expansive menu options throughout the celebrations. We also accommodate outside caterers for ethnic cuisine.
