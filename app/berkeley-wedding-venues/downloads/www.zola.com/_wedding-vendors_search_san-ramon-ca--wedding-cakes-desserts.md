Amanda Nguyen founded the company in 2017, determined to push the cake industry towards a more modern aesthetic, more nuanced flavors, using technology to create a better customer experience, and ethical treatment of food industry workers.“We were so happy to have gone with Butter& for our wedding cake! The wedding cake sampler they have was helpful in choosing the flavor. The overall process of ordering, following up with questions and details, and delivery of the cake was flawless. They even had a cake tracker the day of the wedding which was awesome! All of our guests raved about the cake (and gluten free version too!) and it was truly perfect. From the taste to the visuals, we highly recommend Butter&!”Jessica H., 4 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/cb91e51a-1e8e-423c-9267-c2536f72ba79?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-cakes-desserts/butter)

Krumbs Cakes 5.0

  * Starts at $45 
  * Serves San Ramon, CA

"I live for the moment when my customers see their incredible edibles for the very first time. Nothing brings me more joy than watching their faces light up with great big smiles. The extreme satisfaction is what gets me every time. Knowing I make dreams come true is why I love what I do."“We're from San Francisco and were getting married in the city, but decided to venture across the bridge after striking out on other vendors due to price, size limitations (270 people_, or general availability. We feel so lucky that we came across Krumbs based on the A experience, from tasting to delivery. From the get-go, it felt like there was nothing they wouldn't do. One thing we truly hoped for was a true cake-tasting experience. In the post-COVID landscape, everything is "come buy cupcakes and let us know what you think." We went out to Krumbs and were so excited to be able to sit down and be treated to all of their cake, mousse, and frosting flavors, and even though we had only inquired about one flavor, we left with two. They were also super-flexible when it came to design and weighed in with their own opinions after learning about the wedding vibe, cake topper, etc. Their pricing was affordable but the experience felt premium in every way, from the tasting to delivery and putting the finishing touches at the venue. We were able to hand them off to our venue coordinator and they managed everything from there. We also had them do our sheet cake for the rest of the guests so everyone could have the same experience. We like them so much we went back to buy a birthday cake for my mother-in-law a few weeks later. SF is great but I feel like we found a gem in Krumb's and would recommend them to anyone.”Andy F., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-cakes-desserts/krumbs-cakes)

Two Chicks In The Mix

  * Starts at $5 per serving
  * Serves San Ramon, CA

The summer of 2013, Malaka approached her bestie since high school, Erica, with a crazy idea: let's start a business! Our love for pastries and food led us into the kitchen and from then on we were Two Chicks in the Mix. It was that very summer where we test baked items like our Lavender Cake and Mixed Berry Pie, which are staples on our menu today. With roots in South LA, we intend to bring a new approach to bakeries in our community. From sourcing California-made, organic ingredients to making everything from scratch, we aim to create an experience that feels and tastes thoughtfully and lovingly made.](/wedding-vendors/wedding-cakes-desserts/two-chicks-in-the-mix)

Our baker backed out 6 weeks before the wedding for health reasons. We had to scramble to find another baker with such short notice! Sienna was very responsive and made communication super easy. She not only committed to making our cake less than 6 weeks out, she made two custom flavors for us! We had very specific flavor combinations that are not your typical flavors. I wanted an ube cake with fudge and oreos. The groom wanted coconut cake with key lime filling. Sienna didn't bat an eye at these custom flavors and totally delivered! Both cakes were incredible and exactly what we wanted, and they were beautifully decorated!

BÁNH BAKERY 5.0

  * Serves San Ramon, CA

BÁNH BAKERY is a cookie-focused bakery, offering small-batch cookies inspired by nostalgic Asian flavors alongside beloved American classics. While “bánh” translates to “cake” in Vietnamese, it’s also a broad term used for many foods—from dumplings and pastries to sticky rice treats and baguettes. We chose the name for its openness and versatility, even though our offerings are exclusively cookies. Rooted in tradition and shaped by our experiences, we bake to honor family, build community, and create second chances—one thoughtfully crafted cookie at a time![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Bánh honors traditional Asian flavors with a new modern twist. They have perfected their sweetness level; not too much and just enough. I’ve ordered variety boxes and dozens of cookies for events such as corporate team offsites, birthdays, baby/bridal showers and bachelorette parties.

Besides my dress, I think the most compliments I received that night were for the desserts which I didn’t even make! Thank you, Elena for the BEAUTIFUL cake you made and for those scrumptious tiramisu tasting cups. I think I ate 3 of them before the party even started! The cake was tasty and so pretty, everyone wanted to take photos of it! Elena made the whole process of ordering a breeze. We talked over Zoom where I showed her the place (my fiancé’s parents’ backyard) and we discussed colors, flavors, and pricing. She had the cake delivered on time in a nice box, and made sure the caterers knew how to set it up and cut it into enough servings for everyone.

Sammycakes 4.3

  * Starts at $75 
  * Serves San Ramon, CA for additional fees

I started Sammycakes in 2014 with a simple ombré rosette cake. The idea of opening up my own bakery, after being inspired by my mother always baking for special occasions, has always been something I imagined for myself since childhood. Since then, I have been featured in coffee shops selling breakfast pastries and created some incredible cakes for exclusive weddings in the Napa Valley area.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Choosing Sammycakes for our wedding on June 27, 2025, at Viansa Winery Sonoma, CA, and our post-wedding event on June 28, 2025, at Brix Napa, CA, was one of the best decisions we made! As a destination bride, the thought of selecting a baker without in-person tastings or detailed discussions was daunting, but Sammycakes immediately put our fears at ease. She perfectly captured our vision, creating the most beautiful wedding cake and groom's cake imaginable. Beyond just being stunning, both cakes were incredibly delicious! We received so many compliments from our guests, with many saying it was some of the best cake they've ever had. The communication throughout the process was easy and clear, making what could have been a stressful experience into a smooth and enjoyable one. We're so glad we trusted Sammycakes with our special day. If you're looking for a baker who delivers on both artistry and taste, look no further!”Kayla M., 6 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/128dd59a-49ab-453c-b7c5-295828d3767c?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-cakes-desserts/sammycakes)

We take pride in our continuous exploration and refinement of flavors, with valuable input from our wonderful community. Your support has been instrumental in our journey, and we eagerly anticipate the opportunity to serve you. Thank you for being a part of our success, and we look forward to delighting your taste buds soon!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“I've enjoyed mochi donuts from other businesses but someone told me I had to try Mochata and I'm glad I took their word for it. Best mochi donuts hands down that I've had in a long time! I reached out to Erik to inquire about catering mini mochi donuts for my wedding in March 2024 and his customer service was on a whole other level. He was so personable and friendly that I just wanted to order just because of that (go small businesses go!). I asked if he had samples to try and he gladly made a batch and I ended up ordering 5 dozen mini donuts. Everyone at my wedding LOVED them. So much that I didn't even get to have any myself during reception! What stands out the most about Mochata's donuts is that the flavor is actually IN the donut itself. Not just the icing that we're all used to. And the texture? Exactly the way a mochi should taste. Flavors? ON POINT!! The toppings are very generous, especially the Cookies N Cream and Mint Oreo. My absolute favorites are Coconut Pandan, Ube and Strawberries N Cream and my husband always goes for the Mint Oreo. Now that it's post-wedding, I've been having cravings so I ordered more just for my family and I to enjoy. I haven't tried all the flavors yet but I have no doubt that they all taste delicious. I also recently got myself a Thai Horchata drink. I never thought about combining the two flavors together and it was super good! Now I feel like I need to try every flavor of that as well. Thank you Erik for being able to make my wedding day even more special!
