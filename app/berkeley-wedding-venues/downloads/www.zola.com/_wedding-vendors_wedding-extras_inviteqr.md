InviteQR was a fantastic addition to our wedding day. Their communication throughout the process was prompt, clear, and incredibly helpful. We used their service to create a custom QR code that allowed all of our guests to easily upload the photos they took during the event. This gave us a wonderful collection of memories from multiple perspectives that we'll cherish forever. The quality of their work was great, and the value they provided for the price was unbeatable. We highly recommend InviteQR to any couple looking for an easy way to gather all the special moments from their big day.

  * ### Creative and Easy to Use

•Arthur•Jun 17, 2025

My fiancee and I loved using InviteQR to add a fun touch to our wedding invitations. It was incredibly easy to use and nicely combined utility and creativity for our invitations. Very highly recommend for anyone looking to add an easily referenceable, aesthetic QR code to their invite!

  * ### Amazing and Easy!

•Verified review

•James T.•Jun 12, 2025

InviteQR provided an excellent experience for our wedding day. Their instructions were clear and easy, helping immensely while checking off another item on our impossibly long planning list. The quality of their work was top-tier, with a streamlined and unique impact that truly captured the essence of our special day. The QR codes they created gave our guests easy access to all the essential details while reflecting the theme of our day on the part of the invitation people engaged with most. We're thrilled with the service InviteQR delivered and highly recommend them to any couple planning their big day.

  * ### Easy, Fast, Beautiful

•Verified review

•Jerry F.•May 29, 2025

We wanted our guests to be able to RSVP by QR code, but we didn't want an ugly black and white square disrupting the beautiful green and sand colors of our invitation suite. InviteQR let us create a perfectly matching QR code that blended seamlessly with the rest of the invitation package. It's a cheap, easy, and overall no-brainer solution to make your QR code match the rest of your invitation design.
