We wanted a cinematic style to capture our day but we also weren’t familiar with the poses nor how to work with a photographer for a full 11 hours. Teddy made it super easy and great to work with him and ask him what we were hoping to get captured on our wedding day. He was communicative, on time, and open to going with the flow as changes came up with our itinerary due to unexpected rain. We got married at our church, took pictures at a nearby garden, and then we traveled 30 minutes to the reception. We definitely recommend him and hope others can have the great experience we had with him!”Itzel H., 8 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/4d5ed45b-0acd-47c7-bc19-98f5bd50ea64?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-videographers/lake-full-of-pictures)

  * Cinematic style

When I first started shooting lots of weddings, I would wake up the next day after a shoot and my wife would ask me how went. “It was insanely cool, and everybody there seemed like SUCH GOOD FOLK,” was a phrase I would almost always use to describe a somewhat ineffable feeling of being surrounded by GOODNESS. Goodness is often found at weddings, and it’s that goodness that we try to find with our cameras, microphones, lights, eyeballs and ears. That's how I came up with the name of my business. Meeting amazing people in beautiful places is what fuels my passion for wedding videography!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Having our wedding day filmed was one of the best gifts we could ask for. Mauricio is a true gem for creating such beautiful wedding videos and how he merges all the special moments with the right music, trust me you'll tear up when you see it for the first time.

Where to begin? We have been married on three separate occasions, but never divorced. Courthouse, traditional, and on the beach. In our home caffeine is more valuable than gold, namely to help us keep up with our kids. They’re demons, except I always hear about good deals with demons and our little ones only offer spilled orange juice. Our puppy is no better. Name Lucy (cute right?) after Lucifer, and two cats who are the only stable members of the household. The house is a zoo, but we wouldn’t have it any other way! Jokes aside, we adore our family. It’s as perfectly as imperfect as we could hope for and our journey is only in it’s prologue.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“If you are looking for professional videographers that make movie-like films that are both unique, emotional, and fun, then look no further!

Besides the fact that Jesse was so wonderful to work with from our first phone call to the day of our wedding, he is so kind and has amazing attention to detail. He caught everything on our video "wishlist" and gave us some of the best tips before the wedding. He asked for our vows, speeches, and ceremony script ahead of time and then incorporated video shots with special words as they are played. All around, incredible!

There’s SO many options and styles out there that it’s also daunting to commit to one. We found Cruzio Studios on The Knot and we are incredibly grateful we did. We were drawn to their journalistic style of capturing love between partners: intimate, natural (doesn’t look too posed), synergizes with the location, delicate, and sweet. After having phone calls with other vendors, we were most excited to work with Cruzio. Not only do they have an amazing portfolio (easily accessible on their beautiful website), but they have great packages to offer their clients. Our package came with an engagement shoot and the results were mind-blowing. I know that sounds hyperbolic, but my partner & I don’t show a lot of PDA and the Cruzio team captured our love so sweetly. When we got the photos and video short, we kept on saying, “That’s us!!” Given their portfolio, we trusted their expertise and artistic eye. Not only were they kind while providing clear directions and great ideas, but they’ll do their best to get the optimal shot. They’re immensely generous with their talents considering all the thought and detail they put into their product. Also, they’re really easy to talk to. We felt like we were just hanging out with friends who are very talented photo/videographers! Cruzio Studios definitely did not disappoint on our wedding day. I’m definitely a planner, so I had a list of group photos we wanted for our wedding day. The Cruzio team had that list with them and ensured we got the shots. They are so professional and stuck to our wedding day timeline with such grace. And although our venue spaces weren’t the biggest, they adapted. To that, my husband & I never felt like they were ever in the way or super noticeable. And, of course, their final products are amazing. They captured the excitement leading up our first look & ceremony and joyous celebration during the reception. Also, the romantics are simply so pretty and caught our love perfectly. It’s so lovely to look back at our special day through their talents and lenses. We consider ourselves fortunate to have had them in our wedding dream team. If you’d like a wedding photo/videographer who are fun & easy to work with, incredibly talented, and experts in their crafts, look no further. Thank you, Cruzio Studios, for everything!!”Steph P., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/4ee134c6-17e5-4d7d-b8a0-d42ca0e691ed?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-videographers/cruzio)

I’m Colin Pattison, owner and filmmaker at Featherstone Wedding Films. I film weddings because I believe in the power of marriage, and I have a passion for capturing special moments on film. I’ve helped countless couples create their ideal wedding film for over 10 years. My goal is to capture lasting memories through beautiful, personalized wedding films. From first consultation, to finished film, I’ll be with you every step of the way.“Colin was probably one of the easiest vendors to work with. We chatted on the phone to get to know him, sent him our deposit and that was that! We talked a bit leading up to the wedding, but he and my photographer communicated to get on the same page/ timeline so I didn’t have to stress much about that either. The day of, him and his team were wonderful all day. They themselves were professional, and all his gear was as well. One of the things I appreciated most about Colin was his ability to be everywhere to get footage, but he was secretive about it, so those that are shy on camera didn’t feel pressured. My videos I got were AMAZING. I don’t know how many times we have watched the videos together or how many I’ve watched it alone but, every time feels like the first. It’s beautiful work and truly captured our wedding day and our personalities. We also got raw footage from him that had us cackling. It’s awesome seeing the day again through both the finished product and the raw footage. Thank you Colin for everything. I highly recommend Colin to everyone!!”Aubrey G., 9 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/d109b045-b058-4538-8d42-2fbbe8366a5b?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-videographers/featherstone-wedding-films)
