## About this venue

We are Mendocino Magic an outdoor events destination and private campground. Home to some of the best stargazing in Northern California, Mendocino Magic also features the pristine Holland Reservoir- the largest private water holding in the North Coast region. Miles of trails wind throughout mountainous hillsides and scenic valleys. These former logging era pathways now lead guests around ponds, through manzanita groves and oak forests, to numerous campsites, weekend getaway cabins, furnished luxury canvas tents, and an exclusive and uniquely secluded woodsball paintball course. Guests can enjoy a traditional campout, with the option to add high-end amenities. There are cabins and facilities on site to host and cater to large groups for private events, corporate retreats, environmental education school outings, weddings, workshops, and seminars. We can’t wait to share it with you.
