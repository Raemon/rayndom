I am an elopement and wedding photographer based in Northern California, who shoots for the fun quirky weirdos who are unabashedly themselves. I capture the perfection that you are while having a laugh and (almost assuredly) crying along while you read your vows. My name is Katelyn and I want to meet you!

My goal is to have you enjoy your day, not feel like you are in an 8 hour photo shoot. I am here to help you feel comfortable, confident, safe and taken care of. I always have snacks available, will help research permits, will find the most amazing spaces for you and your elopement.

  * ### Katelyn is the Perfect Wedding Photographer! 

•Verified review

•Kevin Z.•Jan 8, 2025

We are beyond thrilled with our entire experience with Katelyn! From our first call, we knew she was the right choice for our wedding photographer. Katelyn was extremely professional but very easy to talk with and made the entire process very clear. She was available leading up to the day and helped us map out our timeline. The day itself was perfect. She made us feel comfortable and was flexible, while ensuring all of our key picture wants were met. She did location scouting beforehand and took us to multiple perfect locations to capture our venue (and us). The photos are beautiful and better than we could have hoped for! She turned them around quickly and her site is very easy to use. We could not recommend her enough and hope to use her for any future life events!

  * ### Katelyn is the best!

•Verified review

•N M.•Nov 1, 2023

We would 1000% percent recommend Katelyn! Choosing a wedding photographer felt daunting, especially since we wanted our day to reflect our unique story—simple, real, and close to nature. The thought of posing for pictures made us both nervous, but Katelyn has a calming presence. We wanted our photos to be genuine, mostly not staged, and Katelyn was the perfect fit. She didn't just take pictures; she captured our essence. And she was so patient, and dedicated, both during the wedding planning and during the day of (in addition to a very nice engagement photo-shoot!). From the get-go, Katelyn was all in. She spent time getting to know us, understanding that we were a bit camera-shy, and scouting out locations to get the best shots. She suggested poses that didn't feel like poses at all—they were just us, being us, with a little guidance. On the day of our wedding, Katelyn navigated our outdoor setting with professionalism. She blended into the background, all while snapping away and capturing our moments—moments we were too caught up in the day to see. Seeing our photos for the first time, we were blown away. They weren't just beautiful, they were authentically us. Katelyn took our quirky traits and tender looks and turned them into art, and captured a great party in amazing detail. There were a few unplanned moments during the party (the Horah, etc), that happened in a blink of an eye, and Katelyn managed to capture them perfectly! For couples looking for a photographer who will understand you and bring out the natural joy in your day, Katelyn is the one!

  * ### So Fantastic to Have Katelyn on Our Big Day!!!

•Verified review

•Erica K.•Sep 1, 2023

We are so incredibly grateful to have had Katelyn as our wedding photographer. Not only is she an extremely talented and professional photographer, she is an amazing human being that was so comforting to have throughout the wedding planning process and on the day of. She is simultaneously playful, flexible, and organic as well as organized and methodical throughout her photoshoots and has taken the best, most extensive set of photos of us as a couple to capture such an awesome moment in time. We had a wedding ceremony and reception with a ton of things going on and huge shot list that Katelyn executed flawlessly and went above and beyond to fully document our big day. Can't recommend her enough!!!

  * ### Book Katelyn!

## Frequently asked questions

6 Answers

Ask them a question

### Will you edit all our pictures?

I shoot a LOT during your day so initially I will edit down the photos and take out any shots that aren't useable. Think blinks, weird talking shots, misfires etc. All of the photos that I deliver are color corrected, edited and cropped if necessary.

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

My turnaround time varies by season. Typically, you’ll be able to view your photos online about 6-8 weeks after your wedding. You will be sent an online gallery to view and download the photos. I keep your engagement photos, sneak peek, and wedding photos in the same place so you have easy access to them!

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically couples reach out to me about a year in advance but please reach out for availability. I am more than happy to take on a last minute booking if I am available.

### Do you also offer video services?

At this time I do not offer video services but I am more than happy to recommend some amazing videographers that I love to work with!

### What’s your back-up plan if you can’t photograph our wedding as planned?

I have never had to cancel a booking but in the event that something out of my control happens, I have a network of photographers that I can reach out to and my second shooters are all capable to photograph solo. I will find someone comparable to myself to fill in for the day and will still handle the editing and delivery of the images.

### Do you have insurance?

Absolutely! Just let me know if your venue requires a certificate of liability, and I’ll send that over to them.
