•Verified review

•Ariana•Jul 29, 2025

Our wedding felt like a perfectly intimate escape, surrounded by nature and the warmth of people who genuinely cared. The venue itself was stunning—lush surroundings, and a layout that made every moment feel cozy, romantic, and uniquely ours. But what truly elevated the experience was the staff. They weren’t just accommodating—they were extraordinary. Every person on the team treated us and our guests with kindness, professionalism, and such genuine enthusiasm. They listened closely, adapted effortlessly to our special requests, and made sure everything flowed with ease. This venue blends breathtaking scenery with a deeply personal touch. If you’re looking for a place that not only delivers a beautiful setting but also makes you feel supported, heard, and at home, this is it. Thank you Little Hills!!!!

  * ### We love Little Hills!

•Verified review

•Carson B.•Jul 5, 2025

Our coordinator’s (Lindsey) wealth of experience was invaluable to us throughout the entire process, from our tour to the big day. Her knowledge of what works and what doesn’t helped to streamline our decision-making process and relieved us of a huge burden. We felt strongly that the Little Hills team had our backs and would do whatever they could to help us realize our vision. They did not disappoint!

  * ### Perfect Venue

•Verified review

•Michael & H.•Jun 26, 2025

Obviously going into wedding planning everything is overwhelming and seems to come at you fast, we toured a few venues but when touring with Lindsey it was so much more of a personal connection and care shown than any other venue. Lindsey and her team truly do focus on you and your vision and take the time to get to know you so they can create the perfect wedding day for you. The venue is the perfect mix of rustic and elegant, making you feel extremely comfortable and confident for the big day. Could not recommend it more!

## Frequently asked questions

11 Answers

Ask them a question

### What is the deposit and is it refundable?

Wedding deposits are 25% of the estimated total Payments can be made via check, ACH or Credit Card (CC processing fees apply). First Deposits are not refundable and are used as a retainer for reserving the date and admin costs associated with initial planning.

### Are dogs allowed?

While dogs are not typically allowed, we do make special exceptions upon request. We’ve happily welcomed many dogs to be part of wedding ceremonies and have occasionally permitted pets at picnics.

### Can you hold a date without a contract?

We offer a 7-day courtesy hold, allowing us to reserve your date on our booking calendar without requiring a deposit. This hold is complimentary for either 7 consecutive days or until another client expresses interest in the same date, whichever comes first. Once your date is placed on hold, we will provide you with a sample Reservation Contract for your review.

### What does the Venue Manager do?

The Venue Manager dedicates 15 hours to each client/event, which includes 9 hours of on-site management on the wedding day, 2 detailed planning meetings, and email/phone correspondence leading up to the event. (Additional hours can be purchased if needed). Your first planning meeting will be scheduled via Google Meet approximately six months before the wedding. On your wedding day, your Venue Manager will be your primary contact at Little Hills, assisting with vendor placement and communication, timeline coordination, and overseeing event staff. Additionally, we will handle the setup of all in-house rentals to ensure everything runs smoothly.

### Do we need a Day-Of-Coordinator

If you are having your ceremony at Little Hills, YES, you will need a coordinator. We do offer basic Ceremony Coordination services in-house which includes conducting the rehearsal, coordinating the ceremony, serving as liaison to bridal party and immediate family on the wedding day, and setting up the guest book table + the head table on the day of. If you prefer to have a more involved coordinator, we have several who we can recommend. You are also welcome to use someone outside of our preferred list with special approval.

### Do you allow outside catering?

Yes, we do allow outside catering for special circumstances such as cultural or more casual cuisine. We have a few recommended caterers who offer more specific menus (i.e. tacos, vegan, pizza, Indian Catering etc.). Our in-house chef is also ver flexible with menu options. If you choose to work with an outside caterer, we require the following: • COI with Palmdale Estates Events and EBRPD listed as additional insured. • Signed Venue/ Kitchen Care Waiver • $500 Refundable damage Deposit • Site visit 30 days prior to the event date.

### Do you allow outside vendors?

Yes, we do allow outside vendors, but we highly recommend using vendors from our preferred list. These vendors have established professional relationships with us, are excellent in their craft, and consistently provide exceptional service to our clients. They are familiar with Little Hills, which helps ensure a seamless event. If you choose to bring in an outside vendor, they will need to sign a Venue Care Waiver and provide a Certificate of Insurance (COI)

### What is the rental time?

Our standard rental is 8 hours, but you can rent the venue up to 12 hours or anything in between. We require a minimum of 2-hours before the ceremony/ guest arrival for set up which is part of the rental. We also need one hour at the end of the event for clean up. Music must cease by 10pm.

### Is there a Bridal Room?

Yes! We have a beautiful bridal room furnished with large mirrors, a beauty bar, emergency essentials, air conditioning, ample lighting, comfortable seating and direct access to the restrooms. This indoor space is accompanied by our newly built charming Bridal Brook-- a shaded cobblestone patio where the gals can sit in the fresh air or take photos. For the Groom, we have a well-equipped room with mirrors, a refrigerator, air conditioning, emergency supplies, and a private adjacent beer garden. Both rooms are available for the entire duration of your rental and can also be used to store personal items throughout the event.

### What if it rains on my wedding day?

Luckily our Tented Terrace reception area is tented with a vinyl, rain proof tent. Our venue team will take preventative action to eliminate water seeping into the tent via sandbags behind the walls. Unfortunately, the Golden Plateau’s ground cover doesn’t do so well in the rain and therefore the ceremony would have to take place on the Redwood Green which has a turf landscape. You will have to rent a canopy for this space if it is raining on your wedding day.

### Do you allow hard alcohol?

Per our specific ABC Licensing we do not allow hard alcohol, however, our distributer recently released a new line of “soft alcohol” which fall within our beer and wine license. They are 24% ABV and make for excellent signature drinks if this is something you’re cosidering. We have whiskey, vodka (Klir), gin, tequila (El Jinete), Le’Cello, Cafe Luna and more. Pricing to serve mixed beverages varies on quantity, types of drinks/ garnishes offered and duration of service. You may inquire about pricing with your event manager. Palmdale Estates Events may recommend that you use a third party bartending service.
