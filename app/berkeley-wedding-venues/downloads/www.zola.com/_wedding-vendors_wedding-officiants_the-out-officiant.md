Hola, I’m Ernesto (he/him/él), The Out Officiant! Ordained by the ULC, I began officiating in 2019 and bring heart, humor, and authenticity to every ceremony. As a gay Latino who’s been through wedding planning myself, I know how vital it is to feel seen and supported. I specialize in LGBTQ+, bilingual, and multicultural weddings, always inclusive, personalized, and stress-free. Based in El Cerrito, my fee varies by distance. Let’s create a ceremony that celebrates your love story!

I blend heart, humor, and high emotional IQ to create ceremonies that are as unique as the couples themselves. I specialize in inclusive ceremonies and bring cultural fluency, bilingual capabilities (English and Spanish), and a personal understanding of what it means to have your identity celebrated, not just tolerated. Whether it’s a queer, interfaith, or multicultural union, I make sure your love story is the star of the show.

**In three words:** Collaborative, Flexible, Thoughtful

  * ### Could not have picked a better officiant!

•Verified review

•Bri•Dec 17, 2025

We booked Ernesto about 3 months before our wedding and could not have had a better time. He was timely and attentive from the first inquiry. We had a great introductory call where it really felt like he was trying to get to know us and our relationship before asking about the logistics and we appreciated that he was genuinely excited for us. It felt more like a chat with a friend than a business inquiry every time we touched base and he still covered questions and logistics we would have never thought of. He was also consistent with communication. We had no idea how to get a license in our city and he did the research for us and helped guide us through each step and what was needed from us since we were traveling for the wedding. He was always quick to respond every time we had a question. He came to the rehearsal and ceremony early which made everything run smoothly and honestly gave us peace of mind. He also incorporated some humor in his speech which is what we wanted and appreciated. Not to mention he was super accommodating outside of the ceremony. So glad we found him on Zola, I could not recommend a better person to marry us!

  * ### Great Officiant for Personalized Script

•Verified review

•Crystal Y.•Sep 24, 2025

Ernesto was a pleasure to work with for our wedding. Even though we booked him just a month before the wedding, he was able to turn around a personalized script for our ceremony in a week, taking in our feedback and stories to craft a truly unique and meaningful script that was exactly what we envisioned. Highly recommend The Out Officiant to any couple looking for an easy, stress-free experience with their wedding officiant and at a great price.

  * ### The BEST Officiant!!

•Verified review

•Fahima•May 29, 2025

Ernesto is the best officiant! He met with us prior to see what we would like incorporated into the ceremony, he showed up last minute to our rehearsal after we forgot to tell him about it, and overall incorporated his humor/personality to make our ceremony truly special! Highly recommend him!

  * ### Helped Us Tie the Knot (Literally)

•Verified review

•Ashley•May 29, 2025

We had a wonderful ceremony with The Out Officiant. He was very responsive, took lots of feedback, and was a joy to have for the ceremony. And getting to know as he was able to capture our feelings for each other and he worked hard to make several things happen. For example, we wanted to physically tie a knot together since that was something that was happening in our relationship a lot and it was very sentimental. He actually crocheted the rope and then did a knot tying ceremony. Again we were very blessed to have him in our lives. He’s a great officiant.

## Frequently asked questions

8 Answers

Ask them a question

### What should the customer know about your pricing (e.g., discounts, fees)?

As The Out Officiant, I strive to offer fair, transparent pricing that reflects the personalized care, preparation, and presence I bring to every ceremony. My fees are based on the location of your ceremony and the overall time commitment. I proudly offer a 20% teacher discount, as a former teacher, I know firsthand how overworked and underpaid educators are, and I’m honored to support them. I also offer referral special pricing as a thank-you to couples and vendors who share The Out Officiant with others. Ceremony Only Within 25 miles: $350 25–50 miles: $450 50+ miles: Starting at $600 Rehearsal add-on available for an additional $100.

### What is your typical process for working with a new customer?

We’ll start with a free consultation (via phone, Zoom, or in person) to get to know each other. During this conversation, we’ll discuss your vision for the ceremony, any special requests, and my services. This is also a great opportunity for you to ask any questions about the process. After our consultation, I’ll send you a proposal outlining the services we discussed and a formal agreement to confirm all the details. This will include pricing, the ceremony structure, and any additional services like attending the rehearsal or travel considerations.

### What education and/or training do you have that relates to your work?

In addition to being ordained by the Universal Life Church, my background as a teacher and school leader has provided me with extensive experience in public speaking and guiding large groups. For over a decade, I’ve led classrooms, facilitated workshops, and presented to diverse audiences, which has made me comfortable speaking confidently and clearly in front of people.

### How did you get started doing this type of work?

It all started in Vegas—no, really! In 2018, some close friends asked me to officiate their wedding and I couldn’t say no. The rest is history!

### What types of customers have you worked with?

I’ve had the privilege of working with a wide range of couples, each with their own unique story and vision for their big day. I specialize in LGBTQ+ weddings, ensuring that queer couples feel fully seen and celebrated in their ceremonies. I’ve also worked with bilingual (Spanish-English) couples, incorporating both languages into their vows and readings, as well as interfaith and multicultural couples who wanted a ceremony that reflects their shared traditions.

### Describe a recent project you are fond of. How long did it take?

One of my recent projects that I'm particularly excited about is the launch of my real estate business. As I embark on this new journey, I see it as a wonderful opportunity to help couples not only celebrate their love through personalized ceremonies but also to assist them in finding the perfect home where they can begin their happily ever after. I love the idea of helping couples envision their future, whether it’s crafting a meaningful ceremony or guiding them through the exciting process of home buying. It’s about building a life together that reflects their dreams, and I’m here to support them every step of the way!

### What advice would you give a customer looking to hire a provider in your area of work?

When hiring an officiant, it’s important to find someone who not only aligns with your values but also makes you feel comfortable and supported. Look for someone who is willing to personalize the ceremony to reflect your unique relationship rather than offering a cookie-cutter approach. Make sure they’re open to any cultural, spiritual, or personal elements you want to include.

### What questions should customers think through before talking to professionals about their project?

Before reaching out to an officiant, it's helpful to reflect on a few key questions to ensure you find the right fit for your ceremony: 1) What is my vision for the ceremony? 2) What are my priorities? 3) What is my budget? 4) Do I have any specific requirements? 5) What’s the timeline for my wedding? 6) How do I want to feel during the ceremony? Taking the time to think through these questions will help you have a more productive conversation with potential officiants and ensure that your ceremony reflects your love story beautifully.
