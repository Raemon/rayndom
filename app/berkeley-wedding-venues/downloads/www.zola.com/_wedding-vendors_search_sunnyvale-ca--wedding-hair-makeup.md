From the jump, she was so sweet, professional, attentive, and extremely talented. Although I didn’t book a trial run, she absolutely killed it! She saw the vision and executed so well on all ends. The entire process was extremely smooth. Zayra also did hair and makeup for my mother and mother in law, both of which came out just as beautiful. Aside from the work itself, her level of communication was extremely appreciated throughout the entire process through and through. If I had a concern she was open to listening and adjusted as needed. This review has been a long time coming.

Hi, I’m Diana, Licensed Esthetician and Makeup Artist. My goal is to accentuate your natural beauty while making you feel amazing on your very special day. I got my start in the world of makeup artistry when the opportunity presented itself to have fun and makeover my friends, family and colleagues. Little did I know, that their positive feedback and encouragement would convince me to pursue this now passion of mine. I am a business woman, self-educated on everything beauty through hands-on experience and by attending some of the best seminars with successful, professional makeup artists, from across the country.“As an older bride, I wanted someone who understood the understated look I was going for. The result was just like she advertised-natural and bumped up. I looked like myself. I was concerned about looking overdone, but it was just right. Diana was great at getting clear about what was important to me during the trial and the execution was seamless on the day.”Brandy V., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/ae7cbe94-8efb-4294-8378-97da8662f827?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/anaya-beauty-co)

Kim Baker Beauty is all about helping people feel like their best self, inside and out. This is so much more than makeup. We don't take it lightly that we are the first people you are with on your wedding day. How we make you feel is our top priority.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“TL;DR: Kim Baker Beauty is fantastic and you should absolutely book them! When looking for a hair & makeup artist, as a queer couple, we were a little apprehensive about finding an artist who would be well-versed in hair & makeup for couples and weddings outside of heteronormative traditions. My partner was a little worried about finding someone who would "get it" in terms of their style--more minimal and masculine--and who wouldn't try to push them into doing a more feminine style. Kim and Audra both totally got it! Kim was super communicative throughout the whole process and was so great to work with. Due to unforeseen circumstances the week of our wedding, Kim couldn't make it--but she immediately organized one of her other artists, Audra, who did a truly superb job. My partner and I both got hair and makeup services. I had a more classic bridal look and my partner had more minimal makeup and their short hair styled. We both absolutely loved the way we looked and felt amazing on our wedding day! We wanted a calm, chill morning while getting ready for our wedding and Audra was lovely, so kind and easy to talk to, and had a very calm energy. Our hair and makeup lasted extremely well throughout the evening, even through hours of dancing! Kim and Audra are total pros and made us feel stunning on our wedding day. I can't recommend them highly enough!”Julia T., 3 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/kim-baker-beauty)

  * Serves Sunnyvale, CA

Hi there, I’m Lauren! I am a Bay Area makeup artist that has been in the beauty industry for 5+ years. My signature makeup style is "soft glam" which is suitable for any anyone between natural to glam brides. Working with me as your wedding makeup artist would not only include the makeup application itself but also around the clock email/ text communication from the very beginning of the booking process to the wedding day. My main priority is to ensure you have a smooth booking process with me and a stress-free wedding morning.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“I wanted to get Glam-Up for my best friend's birthday. Lauren responded super quickly after I submitted the request on her Instagram. I don't usually wear makeup and I didn't know exactly what I wanted so we discussed what type of makeup style and products that would look best and be the most compatible with my skin, hair, and outfit. She is very easy and so much fun to talk with and is very knowledgeable. She listened to what I roughly wanted and offered her advice in a considerate manner. On the day of the appointment, she was on time and kept to the schedule. She was incredibly professional, efficient, and accommodating. Everyone LOVED the result. I was OBSESSED with the look that she created. I got endless compliments on my look and people were constantly asking who the artist was. I highly recommend Lauren for any special occasions or if you just want to feel good! She definitely has a way to hype you up and make you feel gorgeous inside AND out!”Hieu, 2 years ago![](https://images.zola.com/bad28820-da91-4c83-a3d9-515605a55e44?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/lauren-m-mua)

Sayoki Studio was founded by Sammy Yoshikami in 2016 and is known for refined, detail-driven beauty services rooted in artistry and precision. A quadruple-certified cosmetic tattoo artist, Sammy is recognized for her hyper-realistic techniques and personalized approach, working one-on-one with every client. With over a decade of experience in the bridal industry, Sayoki Studio specializes in timeless, skin-focused makeup that enhances natural features and photographs beautifully. Each bridal look is thoughtfully customized to feel elevated, comfortable, and true to the individual—ensuring confidence from the first look to the final dance.“Sammy is truly the best wedding makeup artist in the Bay Area. I was hesitant to book a makeup artist because my skin tone is difficult to match, and contour often makes me look gray or ashy. Sammy’s expertise in color completely put me at ease—she knew exactly what shades and techniques would work best for my skin, and the result was flawless. It was the most beautiful I’ve ever felt. She genuinely listened to what I wanted, took the time to prep my skin properly before application, and made sure everything looked perfect. Beyond her talent, Sammy is incredibly kind, professional, and easy to work with, which made the entire experience stress-free on such an important day. I would book her again in a heartbeat and cannot recommend her enough to future brides.”Nicole M., 9 days ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/sayoki-studio)

From the moment I reached out to her, she was very responsive, thorough and professional. My biggest concern was not looking/feeling myself since I don't wear a lot of makeup. She took the time to listen and worked with me to understand my vision and make my makeup/hair vision come true. During the trial, she checked with me every step of the way to make sure I feel comfortable. Thao and her team were able to finish makeup and hair for myself, the moms, and 7 other bridesmaids on time.

Jireh Artistry

  * Serves Sunnyvale, CA

Susan created Jireh Artistry in 2016 after over a decade of experience in the Bridal Beauty Industry. Her vision was to create a brand known for their talent, quality of service and most importantly HAPPY Brides! We first began offering services in Northern California, where our studio location is based. In 2017 we expanded our services to Las Vegas and Hawaii (Oahu, Maui and Kauai). After discovering a love for travel and adventure, Susan decided to offer specialty services catering to Destination Brides! That’s pretty much our story in a nutshell but feel free to reach out to us if you would like to hear more!](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/jireh-artistry)
