## Frequently asked questions

3 Answers

Ask them a question

### Can we bring our own alcohol?

Yes, however all alcohol for the duration of every event must be served by a licensed bartender. We do not allow drinks of any kind to be served in individual glass bottles to guests. Aluminum cans are OK. Wine & Champagne bottles are allowed at table service, but not to be consumed by guests individually.

### Do you have on-site parking?

Yes, and for every big event we will always have our team members assist with parking and directing guests as they arrive to your event. Vendors and anyone helping with event set ups will also be guided to the event area. We also have reserved spots inside closer to our barn for any guests who would like more accessible parking, as well as a golf cart for those others who wish to be shuttled in after parking. We do not offer in-and-out privileges or self-parking.

### How many hours are included in our booking?

For wedding, we allow a total of 4 hours & 30 minutes for all reception only events and a total of 6 hours for an event with both a wedding ceremony & reception. All other extra hours that you would like to include to your event would be $200 each, with our cutoff being midnight. All of this is determined by your event's start time of course.
