We booked her to take our engagement and wedding photos and we were very happy with the results. Neither of us love getting our photo taken but she made the whole process easy and comfortable. She recommend a bunch of beautiful locations for our engagement shoot that were in our area and worked around our schedule. Our wedding photos were great (even got some with us and our dogs) and she got lots of amazing shots of our guests enjoying themselves. We highly recommend booking Carrie for your special day! Professional, efficient, and a wizard behind the lens.

Follow me on Instagram *vanessamontanophotography I’m Vanessa—Bay Area born and raised, living my dream under the California sun with a camera always close by. When I’m not documenting life’s beautiful moments, I’m likely in the kitchen testing new recipes, catching up with friends over a dirty martini, cruising with country music turned up, or spending time with my family. Photography isn’t just my work—it’s something I truly love. I feel incredibly grateful to witness and capture so many meaningful stories.“We are so happy we had the opportunity to have Vanessa capture our special day! The quality of her work is exceptional, with beautiful colors and candid moments filled with love.

With a background in shooting portraits, events, couples and food, getting to shoot all of the above makes weddings a dream for me. Not to mention I am a BIG hopeless romantic and I can't get enough of love. Which brings me here, to photograph your big day! I absolutely love connecting with my couples, learning about the two of you and what makes your story special to you.

Shawna GD Photography 5.0

  * Fine art style
  * Starts at $1,600 
  * Serves Berkeley, CA

I photograph intimate weddings and elopements with intention, emotion, and a little bit of edge. My approach is simple: your photos should feel like you. Real, raw and timeless, not stiff or performative. I'm here to catch the unplanned magic and the editorial moments that make your story look and feel as fabulous as you do.“I had the absolute privilege of having Shawna capture my engagement photos, and later, serve as my second shooter on my wedding day. I say “privilege” because I still can’t believe someone so kind, genuine, and sweet truly exists. When I first met Shawna and her husband Patrick for our engagement session, they made the entire experience so easy and fun, even though my husband and I are far from comfortable in front of a camera. They made the session completely about us, helping us feel relaxed and natural. The moment we finished, I knew there was no way I could imagine my wedding day without Shawna being a part of it. At the wedding, Shawna seamlessly collaborated with my main photographer. She was professional, detail-oriented, and fully committed to making sure our day was as perfect as it could be. But Shawna went beyond just photography, she truly got to know us as a couple, took the time to learn what mattered to us, and poured her passion not only into her work but into us as clients. On my wedding morning, I was having a really difficult time, but the second Shawna arrived, her smile and calming presence gave me comfort I can’t even put into words. She immediately asked, “How can I help?”… and she meant it. She jumped right in, kept me grounded, and reminded me to enjoy the moment. I will never regret choosing Shawna for my photos. Not only did I gain beautiful memories captured forever, but I also feel like I’ve gained a friend for life.”Patricia, 3 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/shawna-gd-photography)

Jessi Clare Photography 5.0

  * Fine art style
  * Serves Berkeley, CA

I love romance and I want to reflect that in my images. Aside from posed editorial type images, my couples do a lot of interaction with each other, allowing me to produce images that reflect true joy, love and emotions. I married my husband twice, not because we were divorced but because our first wedding was at a courthouse, and on 1st year anniversary, we renewed our vows in front of 100s of our family and friends. We have 2 beautiful daughters that keep us on our toes. And when I am not photographing weddings, I work as a nurse in the emergency room.“Jessi's talent is absolutely incredible and unmatched. Not only does she have an eye for beauty and perfect lighting, but she captures images that are genuine and breathtaking. She is very professional, very personable, and very patient which is an amazing combination for a photographer. We can't wait to use her for our pregnancy photos and family photos for years to come. Thank you Jessi!”Jessica and C., 5 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/jessi-clare-photography)

Photography transforms your memories into tangible pieces of art. As a photographer, I get to capture your most cherished moments, which throughout the years transform into gifts for your future generations. I love to capture the organic emotion throughout your wedding day: the smiles, laughs and happy tears, it brings me back to my middle school reportage days. I also love to art direct and get those more editorial portraits and details that all get layered together with my documentary images to create the tangible record of your love story.](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/adriana-klas-photography)

I have been a photographer for 8 years. Throughout my time as a photographer I’ve captured clothing, models, and memories. I shifted from corporate shootings to families and weddings because it gave me this warm fuzzy feeling when I edited my couples and families photos. Don’t be afraid to reach out to me and ask about my photography style, my editing style, or my favorite restaurant! I highly recommend scheduling a free consulting session!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Grace was a pleasure to work with during the wedding planning process. She was timely in her responses and upfront with pricing. On the day of the wedding, it felt like we were herding cats, but she remained professional and efficient. Even though we were running behind schedule with getting dressed, she managed to squeeze in a few dress shots and some first look photos. Grace remained patient even as some of our friends and family showed up late for photos! As we moved between locations, she made sure I was holding my dress in a way so that I wouldn’t fall on my face. She also helped my MOH bustle my dress after the ceremony (again, so I wouldn’t fall on my face). Grace was always cognizant of the lighting on location, and how it would affect photos. Her assistant, Joey, was lovely and accommodating as well. All in all, a wonderful experience!”Tina Y., a year ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/oury-memories)

Apollo Fotografie {Fine Art Wedding Photo & Video} 5.0

  * Fine art style
  * Starts at $3,775 
  * Serves Berkeley, CA
  * Offer

We’re Apollo Fotografie. When it comes to visual storytelling, we don’t miss a beat. We prioritize organization, punctuality, and beauty so your wedding day looks better than your dreams. At Apollo, inclusivity is one of our core values, and our couples come from all backgrounds. We know that not everyone is comfortable in front of the camera, and we’re here to help. All of our photographers use prompts and suggestions to encourage natural interactions for a less “scripted” feel.“We couldn’t be happier with our decision to have Apollo capture our wedding day. We searched for a lot of different photographers. I wanted someone who can capture good (aka hot) bridal portraits and party pictures, and they DELIVERED. Our photos turned out so dreamy, classic, and timeless. Like seriously--I want to post them everywhere! We’ve gotten so many compliments on them. There was a little change-up, as the photographer was switched from the owner to a lead photographer Jess, but honestly, it worked out perfectly because she was such a good sport the entire day, hyped us up so much, and made us feel so comfortable in front of the camera. That was not easy to do since we had what seemed like a million events that day. Overall they were just great to work with. We're so happy we found them. Would definitely recommend!”Annie L., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/9c3a2284-2e63-402d-ab3d-04c9398b7086?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/apollo-fotografie-fine-art-wedding-photo-video)

Fox & Fig Photography 5.0

  * Fine art style

  * Serves Berkeley, CA

Hello lovely! Let me introduce myself—I’m Sarah. Welcome to my little creative space—I hope you love it here & make yourself at home. My goal as your photographer is to put you at ease and therefore be able to capture your moments authentically and beautifully. As a film and digital photographer ("hybrid" if you will!), I take a big step back to capture your memories with intention, love, and honesty - my promise to you, is to treat your day as if it were my own. Film is my favorite medium to capture wedding days on, as I feel it brings back a level of authenticity, imperfection, and refined elegance that is irreplaceable.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“From the moment we booked Fox & Fig Photography for our wedding, their communication was phenomenal and they were always quick to respond to any questions we had. Their work is simply gorgeous - exactly the style we were looking for to capture our special day. On the wedding day, they made both my husband and I feel at ease, even though we are a bit awkward in front of the camera. They provided excellent guidance on posing and helped us look our best. Fox & Fig was incredibly supportive and patient with us as a nervous couple. We are thrilled with the sneak peeks of our photos and can’t wait for the whole product! I can NOT recommend Fox & Fig enough.”Maddie M., 2 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/3eb30975-26ff-475b-9666-ebac22c87259?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/fox-fig-photography)

Cassie Valente Photography 5.0

  * Fine art style
  * Starts at $9,750 
  * Serves Berkeley, CA

My name is Cassie and I am a hybrid film + digital photographer, completely fascinated by the human story and the parts of it that we all share. My aim is to tell the story of your love and laughter through images that are timeless and intentional. I believe in storytelling through details, emotional portraits, and finding those quiet moments in the midst of celebration. I love capturing real moments that help my couples remember how they felt on their wedding day, through the lens of my own airy and dreamy style.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“From the moment we started working with Cassie, it felt like we were reconnecting with an old friend. Cassie is so thoughtful, patient, and funny- and we got to experience that multiple times when we connected with her for our photography. We truly believe that her vision and personality is what makes her photos feel so authentic and filled with light love. As awkward people anxious about taking photos, we were so relieved how Cassie made us feel comfortable from the beginning of our engagement session. She was able to somehow fade into the background, while also guiding us and capturing genuine moments. We loved that photo session so much that we ended up hiring her for our welcome dinner as well! Cassie was so easy to work with leading up to the wedding, making sure to get a list of our important shots ahead of the wedding while working closely with our planner to make sure there was a clear schedule. This meant that we could be as present as possible on our wedding day. On the big day, Cassie honestly felt more like a part of the wedding rather than simply a vendor. She knew how to make everyone comfortable, made sure the bridesmaids and groomsmen were having fun, and made the day feel natural for us. We got all of the wedding photos we wanted, and managed to even be AHEAD of schedule so we got to spend more time at our cocktail hour!!! Cassie’s photos capture the full range of emotions on the wedding day, because she’s able to connect deeply with her couples and understand what is important to them. Her style was something we gravitated to as we wanted a photographer who would not simply chronicle our event, but also capture the small details and genuine emotions that we might miss during the day. For both the engagement shoot and our wedding weekend, Cassie promptly delivered sneak peek highlights within a couple of days, and the full album within her initial estimate (8 weeks). She managed to capture the full essence of the day. Everytime we look at those photos, they bring us right back to those moments and feelings. We are so lucky and thankful to have had Cassie as our photographer. Hire her for your wedding! You will not regret it!!”Kirsten, a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/4eeb82bc-6ff8-470d-b405-37e1d8ae85c9?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/cassie-valente-photography)

  * Serves Berkeley, CA

Luxury wedding photography in California and worldwide... You want your photos to be as unique as you are. You want photos that capture the intimacy and emotion of your day. I have spent the past decade developing my approach to wedding photography, learning how to be unobtrusive, when to take the lead, and when to take step back and anticipate the moment. The resulting experience is one that allows you to be in the moment. The resulting images are authentic, beautiful and timeless.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Roberta is nothing short of AMAZING. The quality of her work speaks for itself, but working with her is just as impressive! She's extremely personable, so easy to work with, and makes you feel right at home in front of the camera. She really takes the time to get to know her clients to provide the shots they desire most. Not to mention she can roll with the punches! Between the location for our engagement shoot being under maintenance, to my husband never being available for meetings, to an overly windy wedding day - none of it phased her and she was more than accommodating. We received all of our photos in what felt like no time at all and the website she uses for her album design and printing is extremely user friendly! We couldn't have picked a better photographer to capture our big day and plan to continue to use her for all our future photo needs :)”Stephanie & R., 5 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/roberta-nicole-photography)
