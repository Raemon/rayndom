“We had the wedding reception of our dreams this July! We were drawn to having our 110-person reception at D'Argenzio Winery for countless reasons including great price and a truly beautiful location. Breanna had excellent, understanding, and flexible communication with us for the entire year leading up to our wedding day. We rented the Terrazzo Patio and Tasting Room Lounge and had open seating for the guests so that they could choose to sit inside or outside! Everyone enjoyed the wine, Prosecco, beer, and soft drink offerings at the bar. We absolutely loved Cibo Rustico's catering of antipasto boards, salads, pasta, and chicken offerings. We also had a banda perform late into the night on the bocce ball court following dinner, speeches, and the first dance! You too can have the wedding you always dreamed of at D'Argenzio Winery!”Emma R., a year ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/d-argenzio-winery)

“The Gables Wine Country Inn was the perfect venue for our wedding. It had an intimate vibe and had such a variety of beautiful atmospheric additions too such as: a charming historic barn, redwood trees, winery, and Victorian building in the backdrop, it couldn't have been better. Pam & Larry (the owners and managers of Gables Wine Country Inn) were so kind when we came to them for a last minute wedding and were so flexible and adaptable with the things we wanted for our wedding. They were extremely helpful in giving us our perfect day: the decor was gorgeous, the venue amazing, food & drink was the best and our guests had a great time too. It was a very easy planning process and they were very easy going about our wishes so I highly recommend this venue for a wedding, it was a wonderful experience and they couldn't have made the stress of planning a wedding any easier. It was a beautiful day and we have wonderful memories and photos of it forever, I couldn't be happier with it!”Holly and J., 5 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-gables-wine-country-inn)

“Paradise Ridge was absolutely stunning for our wedding! Even though it rained all day unexpectedly, the venue was just breathtaking. The only thing I would definitely change is that they have ceremonies start at 6pm and receptions end at 11pm- I wish we would've either added the optional hour to go to midnight or rented the space out to start earlier since everyone was having a ton of fun and it felt like the dancing didn't last as long as some other weddings we've been to. The staff was professional and knowledgable, and we didn't have any problems day of. They also have chairs and tables for 150 people included, which was great when making the rental order. Overall, PRW was fantastic.”Shelby L., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/d4b50d18-12bf-48cb-a817-dece0c49021e?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/paradise-ridge-winery)
