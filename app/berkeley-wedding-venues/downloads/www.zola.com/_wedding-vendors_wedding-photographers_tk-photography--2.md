TK Photography is a wedding photography company based out of San Leandro, California. TK began her career as a designer but eventually decided to pursue a career in professional photography. Because of her experience as a designer, TK’s love of architecture, interior design, and graphics strongly influence her work behind the camera. The photographer has nearly a decade of photography experience. TK’s patience and calming personality make her easy to work with. Although TK Photography is based in Northern California, the photographer is willing to travel all around the world in order to work with her clients.

I make the experience the first priority and the beautiful images are just the bonus. I keep couples engaged, in the moment and give them a life time of memories to take with them afterwards. I follow them through important life stages like growing their families.

  * ### Wedding Photos 

•Verified review

•Shon A.•Dec 11, 2025

TK was our photographer, and once again, she delivered exceptional work. The photos she captured were absolutely amazing. This is our third time working with TK she photographed both of our engagement sessions prior to the wedding and each experience has been outstanding. If you’re looking for a photographer who is detail-oriented, reliable, and truly serious about her craft, this is the company you want.

Response from vendor•Dec 15, 2025

Spectacular wedding with doves release, harp player, and several choreographed dances. What else could a wedding photographer ask for? It was a delight and honor to be apart of a special day with two very deserving people.

  * ### Only Good Words! 

•Verified review

•Savannah•Nov 14, 2025

I was absolutely astonished with how beautiful the pictures came out (though not surprised as this is our second time working with Thoun and her assistant Toni)! I really wanted to go above and beyond with our photography for the wedding and she delivers far more than I could have ever hoped for!! She has a keen eye with setting us up in the perfect spots to capture the most of everything around us, especially the natural lighting coming through the trees! I love how both Thoun and Toni were able to help us with figuring out how to pose around certain situations and how helpful they were with handling my huge dress lol I have nothing but good words for these two and will always recommend them!!!

Response from vendor•Nov 15, 2025

Truly an amazing couple, with remarkable taste. Thank you for bringing us along your wedding journey. It was easy to capture so many stunning pictures with this fun, lighthearted couple throughout the forest.

  * ### Thoun is awesome! 

•Verified review

•Keilani F.•Jul 24, 2025

We had such a great experience working with Thoun for our engagement photos. She made everything feel easy and natural—there was no pressure to pose a certain way or act differently. She has a calm, thoughtful presence that helped us feel comfortable from the start, and the photos came out beautifully. We’re really grateful for the experience and would absolutely recommend her.

Response from vendor•Jul 25, 2025

You made the shoot effortless by being yourselves and knowing what you like. I had a great time capturing some really stunning photos. Thank you for introducing me to a new location.

  * ### Engagement Shoot

•Verified review

•Kidane M.•May 23, 2025

Thoun was an absolute pleasure to work with! A true professional who does whatever it takes to make your vision come to life! Thoun went above and beyond to make sure that our engagement pictures were exactly what we wanted and more. Her attention to detail and thoroughness to make sure that each photo is perfect really made this a great experience. Thoun really made my fiancè and I feel comfortable which really allowed us to relax and make the photoshoot as natural as possible. Her deep knowledge of photography was on full display as she did a great job making each shot look like a masterpiece. Thoun was able to edit our photos and get them back to us much faster than we expected, and the photos turned out amazing! If you are looking for an amazing photographer, look no further, Thoun is the one for the job!

## Frequently asked questions

8 Answers

Ask them a question

### Do you work with assistants or other photographers?

I offer packages that include a second shooter. Sometimes I bring an assistant for an Engagement Session, but there's no additional charge.

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically, couples book me about 13 months before their wedding date. I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible about my availability, even if you’re planning on a shorter time frame.

### Will you edit all our pictures?

Definitely. All final images will be edited for color, saturation, exposure, and sharpness to ensure they look beautiful. I also offer retouching services like blemish removal and teeth whitening for an additional charge.

### Do you also offer video services?

No, I prefer focusing on photography only, so you can get the best wedding pictures possible.

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

My turnaround time varies by season. Typically, you’ll be able to view your photos online about 4-6 weeks after your wedding. I typically send a "Sneak Peek" in a week or two after the wedding. Within this time, you can also expect to receive a link with high-resolution image files, so you can share the photos with your loved ones and order prints.

### How many pictures will we get?

You can expect about 500-1000 images for micro wedding (4hrs). 1500 images for 8 hours one shooter. 3000 images 8hrs 2 shooters. But keep in mind this estimate varies depending on your wedding package, number of guests, venue type, and other factors.

### Do you have insurance?

I can purchase liability insurance if the venue requires it and an additional charge would be applied. Average price is $75 Just let me know if your venue requires a certificate of liability, and I’ll send that over to them.

### What’s your back-up plan if you can’t photograph our wedding as planned?

In my 11 years of experience as a wedding photographer, I’ve never cancelled a booking. In the very rare event that I’m unable to photograph your wedding, I’ll make sure you’re covered by second shooter and reimburse you for one photographer if you booked for two, or issue a full refund and allow you to go with another photography company.
