## About this venue

Our venue is centered in the heart of the UC Berkeley Campus. Built in the 1950's, Alumni House has a cozy and warm atmosphere, ready to welcome all alumns, friends, and newcomers to campus. The event space consists of both indoor and an outdoor areas. The Toll Room is a large open space preserved in its original mid century modern aesthetic with a full wall of sliding glass doors. It opens on to the patio surrounded by mature trees that create a charming canopy decorated with string lights. Surrounded by towering red woods, and a trickling creek, you can have the best of both worlds: an outdoor space with the convenience of being close to the city. Our wedding package includes access to entire event space including an indoor event space, patio, and kitchen.
