“We had the absolute best experience with Fairview Laguna Seca! From the very beginning, Danielle was the reason we fell in love with the venue, her energy, warmth, and attention to detail made us feel so confident in our decision. When she transitioned out of her role, we were a little anxious, but then Melissa came in and completely blew us away. Melissa worked with us through the last 6 months of planning and was nothing short of incredible. She listened to every idea, every concern, and somehow made everything happen exactly how we envisioned it. She always made us feel heard, never overwhelmed, and her calm, organized energy was everything we needed. On the day of the wedding, she was a total rockstar. She kept everything running smoothly and still managed to check in with us, make us laugh, and reassure us that everything was under control. We honestly don't know what we would’ve done without her! Amber joined the team just days before the wedding, but you’d never know it. She was so on top of things and jumped right in like she had been with us the whole time. Matt was also amazing, he made sure the day flowed perfectly and kept everything on schedule without ever making us feel rushed. The food was delicious and there was so much of it, our guests are still talking about it! The bartending team was fast, friendly, and so easy to work with. Everyone from the Fairview Laguna Seca team went above and beyond to make our day feel special and stress-free. Our DJ, Ernesto, did an incredible job! He stuck to the vibe we wanted, played every request we had, and kept the dance floor going all night long. And the FLORALS … wow. D'Lily's absolutely nailed it. Every arrangement was stunning, fresh, and picture-perfect. They truly brought our vision to life. We can’t thank the entire Fairview Laguna Seca team enough. Our wedding was a dream, and it's all because of the amazing people who made it happen!”Andrea& Nayeli D., 9 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/5ac1b9a7-b06b-4e82-b0f3-4c1a7d71aa58?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/fairview-laguna-seca)

“The Bird Ranch is pure magic. From the moment we arrived, it felt like stepping into another world. It's serene, timeless, and has so much attention to detail. Every inch of the property is beautifully designed. Julie the owner has made it cozy with beautiful interiors and sprawling curated outdoor spaces. The presence of nature is so incredible (butterflies, birds, creek, etc.) We hosted our weekend here, and it was perfect. The property has an incredible balance of rustic charm and thoughtful modern touches. It's the kind of place that instantly makes everyone feel at ease. This place has so much soul. It’s not just a venue, it’s an experience. If you’re looking for a space that feels elevated but still grounded and deeply authentic, this is it!! I can’t recommend it enough.”Alexis, a month ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-bird-ranch-at-san-luis-creek)

“After extensive searching, we stumbled upon this place via family friend recommendation. It was perfect! The owners responded quickly to any questions and concerns we had. Not only was the venue GORGEOUS, but we, as well as the wedding party, were able to rent the venue the night before and the night of the wedding. It saved us a lot of stress because our wedding party was all in one place! This also allowed our vendors to set up earlier in the day.

![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“To begin describing the experience we had at Del Oro Valley is difficult to do! Because it was SO amazing. We had our wedding venue cancel on us 6 months before our wedding and it was an emotionally deflating experience. However we didn’t realize at the time it was a gift that landed us at the most magical venue full of people more aligned with everything we love and stand for. Del Oro valley saved our wedding and provided us with more than we could have ever asked for. They went above and beyond to provide us with a peak experience I’m certain we couldn’t have achieved elsewhere. They helped us produce a talent show at, provided camp counselors for games and community activation, provided a place with incredible sound for us to dance all night, catered delicious food for 110 people, and gave us lasting memories. This venue has it all. Gorgeous mountain outlooks at the amphitheater for our ceremony and a candlelit patio dinner. An A-frame cabin decked out with lights and an excellent sound system for dancing. There’s a huge pool at main camp near lodging for folks to relax at during the day, and lodging onsite for all your people to stay and connect over the weekend. Couldn’t recommend this venue more. Thank you Del Oro Valley for sharing one of the most memorable weekends with us!”Amanda & W., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/cc2b1f50-61fe-4953-8e10-33fe680a5b61?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/deloro-valley)

“The Reserve at Spanos Park was the perfect venue for our engagement party. Which was held on the Clubhouse patio. From the moment we first met with the staff, they were incredibly personable, outgoing, and kind. Rebecca, the wedding coordinator, was very attentive to our needs and made sure every detail was taken care of. The venue itself was absolutely beautiful and gorgeous, creating an intimate setting for our special day. The staff set up and broke down everything seamlessly, and the food was amazing. We're so grateful to the team at The Reserve at Spanos Park for helping to make our engagement party truly unforgettable.”Rachelle C., 8 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/98381ef1-7075-4f52-8ee8-63d5f91bf21f?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-reserve-at-spanos-park)

“I got married at Guglielmo Winery in Sept 2024 and had an absolutely amazing and unforgettable experience. I am so happy with our choice of this venue. Starting with the initial tour of the venue, the Event Director, Brianna, was incredibly sincere, friendly, and knowledgeable. We met with her a few times over the course of our wedding planning process, and she was so communicative and on top of things throughout the whole process. After planning a wedding, the best advice I can give to an engaged couple is to find vendors who are good communicators. There are vendors who will be slow to respond or not respond at all in the wedding planning process without multiple reminder emails, and it can add so much unneeded stress. From setting up the initial tour of the venue to our check-in meeting to our ceremony rehearsal two days before the event, I can’t say enough about how good Brianna was with her communication with us. Convenience for guests was an important factor for us, and the venue is easily accessible from the freeway and has easy parking across the street in a large high school parking lot. No winding roads or lost guests! And it has the ceremony area, cocktail hour, reception, and dance floor all in close proximity to one another. The lighting at night is absolutely beautiful with the string lights under a large canopy tent. And it felt so spacious and comfortable for our 160-person wedding. There are pricing packages to fit any number of guests, whether it be for a small intimate wedding for 50 guests or a large 300-person wedding. If you’re looking for an outdoor wedding venue, Guglielmo Winery is the place for you!”Ronald C., 6 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/guglielmo-winery)

## About wedding venues in Turlock, CA

### 

California offers an incredible 840 miles of coastline, 3,000+ wineries and ancient redwoods for your wedding day. When you choose the Golden State, you're getting exceptional natural lighting for your ceremony across diverse settings from Mediterranean coastal zones to alpine mountain backdrops. Each region has its own distinctive character that can perfectly match your vision.

### What Makes California Wedding Venues So Special?

Northern California's Napa Valley welcomes you with rolling vineyards and Spanish colonial architecture where intimate wine cave ceremonies create unforgettable moments. Head to Southern California and you'll find oceanfront venues like Duke's Malibu where you can exchange vows with the Pacific stretching out behind you while enjoying fresh coastal-inspired cuisine. Palm Springs offers dramatic desert venues with mountain backdrops and striking midcentury modern architecture that photographs beautifully.

### How Much Do Wedding Venues in California Cost?

Wedding venues in California typically run between $9,600 and $11,700 which aligns nicely with the national range of $6,500-$12,000. This represents about 18% of your total wedding budget. Your overall costs will vary based on guest count:
