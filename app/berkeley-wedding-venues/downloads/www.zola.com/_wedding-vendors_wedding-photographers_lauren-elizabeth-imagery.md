There is nothing more beautiful than a love story well told. Through the highs and lows of the past year of a pandemic, it is clear that love conquers all. The profound emotions, the small gestures and glances, the words of honesty and love shared are memories that will last a lifetime. I photograph weddings to highlight that connection, to ensure your feelings from that day can be looked back on and cherished forever.

You are not getting a photographer when you hire me, you are getting a friend (cue 'You Got a Friend in Me' OR 'Thank You for Being a Friend,' whichever you prefer). I am here to provide advice on the hue of bridesmaid gowns, or if the ceremony should be facing a certain direction. I am here for wedding day timelines, pep talks, and day-of meditative breathing exercises to help calm your jitters. I am here to make you feel beautiful and comfortable in front of the camera. I am here to capture your love, your connection, your spark, and your story.

  * ### Would definitely hire again!!!

•Verified review

•Shan M.•Jan 6, 2026

I hired Lauren for a more informal shoot with my family and would most definitely work with her again and again. She was quick to respond to all of our questions and made us feel at ease throughout the entire process. The quality of her work is stunning - we were amazed at how quickly and efficiently she was able to create a huge variety of beautiful shots with different people, "get the shot" and move on quickly since we had a bit of a short time and attention span due to kids. Lauren was also able to help direct the best color scheme, positioning of people and make it feel as natural as possible. Some of the candid photos she took are my absolute favorites. We were thrilled with the final photos, they looked EXACTLY as I was hoping they would look - and Lauren offered great value given her expertise and talent. Lauren truly exceeded our expectations, and we would highly recommend her to any couple!

  * ### Artistry and depth

•Verified review

•Tammy Hughes•Jan 15, 2025

Lauren Elizabeth Imagery is a dream to work with. I've shot many weddings with her over the years. Her communication style is relaxed, clear, humorous, efficient, and always positive. She puts everyone at ease throughout the day. Her images are distinctive, fresh, earthy, and emotional. She captures the story of a wedding in a way that feels ageless. Like a true artist, Lauren sees things in her clients (at weddings or portrait sessions) that others often miss. Additionally, Lauren gets along with everyone from all walks of life, from the smallest flower girls to grandparents, making her a joy to be around.

  * ### Lauren is a gem

•Verified review

•Monique & J.•May 28, 2021

Her ability to get exactly what you want and need whether it be for your big day, a birthday party, a portrait session or a family shoot. Lauren will make you feel Comfortable and full of life in all aspects of life. I have hired her for all my moments I needed captured and she has never disappointed me. Would recommend her over anyone.
