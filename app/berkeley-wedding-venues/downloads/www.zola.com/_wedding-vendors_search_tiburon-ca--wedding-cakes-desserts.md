Amanda Nguyen founded the company in 2017, determined to push the cake industry towards a more modern aesthetic, more nuanced flavors, using technology to create a better customer experience, and ethical treatment of food industry workers.“We were so happy to have gone with Butter& for our wedding cake! The wedding cake sampler they have was helpful in choosing the flavor. The overall process of ordering, following up with questions and details, and delivery of the cake was flawless. They even had a cake tracker the day of the wedding which was awesome! All of our guests raved about the cake (and gluten free version too!) and it was truly perfect.

Sammycakes 4.3

  * Starts at $75 
  * Serves Tiburon, CA

I started Sammycakes in 2014 with a simple ombré rosette cake. The idea of opening up my own bakery, after being inspired by my mother always baking for special occasions, has always been something I imagined for myself since childhood. Since then, I have been featured in coffee shops selling breakfast pastries and created some incredible cakes for exclusive weddings in the Napa Valley area.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Choosing Sammycakes for our wedding on June 27, 2025, at Viansa Winery Sonoma, CA, and our post-wedding event on June 28, 2025, at Brix Napa, CA, was one of the best decisions we made! As a destination bride, the thought of selecting a baker without in-person tastings or detailed discussions was daunting, but Sammycakes immediately put our fears at ease. She perfectly captured our vision, creating the most beautiful wedding cake and groom's cake imaginable. Beyond just being stunning, both cakes were incredibly delicious! We received so many compliments from our guests, with many saying it was some of the best cake they've ever had. The communication throughout the process was easy and clear, making what could have been a stressful experience into a smooth and enjoyable one. We're so glad we trusted Sammycakes with our special day. If you're looking for a baker who delivers on both artistry and taste, look no further!”Kayla M., 6 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/128dd59a-49ab-453c-b7c5-295828d3767c?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-cakes-desserts/sammycakes)

Renee is fast, efficient, and incredibly kind. Her work is meticulous, detail-oriented, and absolutely beautiful. Peaches Custom has worked with hundreds of themes and design requests from me, and she always delivers a 100/10 product.

Moxie's Frozen Yogurt Truck 5.0

  * Starts at $450 
  * Serves Tiburon, CA

I purchased Moxie’s Frozen Yogurt in 2019, not knowing the challenges ahead. From fire evacuations to pandemic shutdowns, we adapted, persevered, and came out stronger. My love for desserts began years earlier, decorating wedding cakes while raising my three sons. Later, I built a bookkeeping business, which led me to the perfect blend of skills and passion—owning Moxie’s. In 2022, we expanded with Moxie’s Frozen Yogurt Truck, serving six flavors, sorbet, and toppings at weddings and events. Family-run and community-focused, we take pride in creating desserts that bring people together.“Moxie's Frozen Yogurt Truck was an absolute delight to work! Their communication was awesome - they were responsive, flexible, and really went the extra mile to make sure our special day was a success. The quality of their work and the value they provided was superb. They donated to our non-profit and helped us be successful at our fundraiser, showcasing their commitment to supporting our community. This business is truly so supportive and helpful, and we're so grateful to have had them as part of our celebration.”Kim S., 3 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-cakes-desserts/moxie-s-frozen-yogurt-truck--2)

If you can’t already tell, we really, really love doughnuts. And it’s our mission to share that love with you, whether it’s in one of our shops, at one of our trucks, at your next event, or even at work. For us, it all started with learning the art of handcrafted doughnuts made from wholesome ingredients. Inspired by history, our recipes started with classic doughs from the 1920’s that we play with based on seasonality and the freshest local ingredients we can find. Our doughnuts are handmade with care, and are fresh every day, of course.](/wedding-vendors/wedding-cakes-desserts/johnny-doughnuts)

Natasha's Treats 5.0

Raised in Ukraine, I grew up loving the delectable European cakes my mother would bake from scratch.

Our baker backed out 6 weeks before the wedding for health reasons. We had to scramble to find another baker with such short notice! Sienna was very responsive and made communication super easy. She not only committed to making our cake less than 6 weeks out, she made two custom flavors for us! We had very specific flavor combinations that are not your typical flavors. I wanted an ube cake with fudge and oreos. The groom wanted coconut cake with key lime filling. Sienna didn't bat an eye at these custom flavors and totally delivered! Both cakes were incredible and exactly what we wanted, and they were beautifully decorated! The cakes were so important to both of us, and Sienna really saved the day!”Katie C., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/34ab2b46-31be-4cea-bc04-10f3e9847b63?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-cakes-desserts/sienna-s-sweets-shoppe)

And that's where it all began. From humble beginnings in Montreal to opening up shop in Danville and happily delivering carbs to our amazing clients. All made with wholesome ingredients and lots of love.“Negar was so easy to work with and made us an amazing cake for our wedding! I cannot stop thinking about how good it tasted and how well it fit into our overall theme. I think one of my groomsmen had 3 slices!

The design was elegant, clean, and refined — every detail looked flawless. It wasn’t just a cake, it was a centerpiece that had all our guests talking and taking photos before even tasting it! And the flavor… incredible. Moist, rich, and perfectly balanced — you could immediately taste the quality and craftsmanship. Many of our guests came back for a second slice and asked where we ordered it from. The delivery was on time, professional, and stress-free, which really matters on a wedding day.

Mochata is a home bakery located in Hercules, CA. Our passion lies in crafting exceptional baked mochi donuts and culturally-inspired horchatas. Every creation is meticulously prepared in-house, reflecting our unwavering commitment to quality. We take pride in our continuous exploration and refinement of flavors, with valuable input from our wonderful community. Your support has been instrumental in our journey, and we eagerly anticipate the opportunity to serve you. Thank you for being a part of our success, and we look forward to delighting your taste buds soon!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“I've enjoyed mochi donuts from other businesses but someone told me I had to try Mochata and I'm glad I took their word for it. Best mochi donuts hands down that I've had in a long time! I reached out to Erik to inquire about catering mini mochi donuts for my wedding in March 2024 and his customer service was on a whole other level. He was so personable and friendly that I just wanted to order just because of that (go small businesses go!). I asked if he had samples to try and he gladly made a batch and I ended up ordering 5 dozen mini donuts. Everyone at my wedding LOVED them. So much that I didn't even get to have any myself during reception! What stands out the most about Mochata's donuts is that the flavor is actually IN the donut itself. Not just the icing that we're all used to. And the texture? Exactly the way a mochi should taste. Flavors? ON POINT!! The toppings are very generous, especially the Cookies N Cream and Mint Oreo. My absolute favorites are Coconut Pandan, Ube and Strawberries N Cream and my husband always goes for the Mint Oreo. Now that it's post-wedding, I've been having cravings so I ordered more just for my family and I to enjoy. I haven't tried all the flavors yet but I have no doubt that they all taste delicious. I also recently got myself a Thai Horchata drink. I never thought about combining the two flavors together and it was super good! Now I feel like I need to try every flavor of that as well. Thank you Erik for being able to make my wedding day even more special!

I bought the Milk chocolate with crispy crepe and cinnamon and the signature Bonbon collection and can tell that the chocolates were amazing. I have been ordering since then and would definitely recommend the Strawberry and Cream bar. All of the chocolates in her selection are unique and I can tell that it is the best homemade chocolate I've ever had. Petrova Chocolates is the place to go for any event from a birthday party to a wedding. The owner, Betty is also very responsive and always makes sure that her clients are satisfied with their orders.”Before You Say I Do, 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-cakes-desserts/petrova-chocolates)
