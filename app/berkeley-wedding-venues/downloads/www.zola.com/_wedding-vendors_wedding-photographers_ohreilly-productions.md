AJ Reilly has been a professional photographer and cinematographer for over 8 years with an emphasis in weddings, creative fine art, and portraitures. He loves capturing the beauty of others and empowering people from behind the lens. He has mastered an array of lighting techniques to blend controlled and natural light for any style. His biggest accomplishment has been to work with thousands of people over the last decade and helping to tell a part of their story through digital media, with 2024 marking his 800th wedding.

OhReilly Productions aims to be an adaptable and dependable brand that brings one of your biggest life moments into focus with exceptional detail and creativity. No two weddings are alike, so not every wedding gallery should look the same. We work with you to blend our styles and creative eyes to curate a gallery that fits your vision of your day. We love finding the look for your gallery through getting to know you. Coaching and guidance is a big part of our services, and we work with you to develop poses to give you a step up in quality, right there in the moment, so that you're not feeling stiff, but relaxed throughout the day.

We couldn't be happier with our wedding photographer, AJ! He was an absolute pro, expertly capturing every moment despite WIND, weather, difficult guests, and me and my husband’s different skin tones, making sure we both looked our best. He handled everything with ease, made us feel super comfortable and taken care of, and he delivered absolutely stunning shots that exceeded all our expectations!

## Frequently asked questions

8 Answers

Ask them a question

### Do you also offer video services?

I do! I have the ability to film with a team as the lead cinematographer, or when I'm the lead photographer, I have associates that will capture your day with cinematic flair and beauty.

### Do you work with assistants or other photographers?

I work with a team of associate photographers that can shoot with me depending on the projects or can shoot in place of me when I have multiple bookings or am traveling for work. I also have several apprentices that I coach, teaching them professional skills valued in the wedding industry.

### Will you edit all our pictures?

Once I curate the best photos from your wedding or event, I personally edit the collection to bring the details off the screen or print. From color correction, to photoshopping that random guest that might have jumped into frame at the last minute, I deliver a clean, crisp library of images for you to enjoy your day all over with your loved ones.

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically, couples book me about 8-14 months before their wedding date, allowing for engagement sessions to be captured early on for Save the Dates and more. I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible about my availability, even if you’re planning on a shorter time frame. Last minute bookings are welcome, subject to availability of course.

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

My turnaround time varies by season. Typically, you’ll be able to view your photos online about 4-6 weeks after your wedding through your personal website I curate for you. You're able to share with your loved ones, download, create lists with your favorite images, and order prints right from the page to be delivered anywhere you like.

### Do you have insurance?

I do! Just let me know if your venue requires a certificate of liability, and I’ll send that over to them.

### What’s your back-up plan if you can’t photograph our wedding as planned?

In my 12 years of experience as a wedding photographer, I’ve never cancelled a booking. In the very rare event that I’m unable to photograph your wedding, I’ll make sure you’re covered by one of my associate photographers, who I have worked directly with to ensure the same level of quality is present even if I'm away!

### How many pictures will we get?

You can expect about 80 to 100 images per hour of photographing. But keep in mind this estimate varies depending on your wedding package, number of guests, venue type, and other factors. I don't deliver RAW files, and focus on delivering the best images after throughly curating your gallery.
