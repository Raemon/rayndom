  * ### Always a pleasure!

•Verified review

•Mike•Jul 17, 2024

We’ve had the pleasure of working with Sonya and the SDEPC team at multiple venues here in San Diego. Each event that we’ve been part of has been planned meticulously. When it comes to the day of the event, things go smoothly, timelines flow efficiently and both clients and vendors are always happy. My favorite thing that I’ve witnessed about Sonya is her ability to communicate and put her clients and vendors at ease with her event planning knowledge and “We can make it happen!” attitude.

Response from vendor•Jul 19, 2024

Thank you so much, Mike! We love working with you and your team! :) <3
