  * ### Magazine-worthy memories

•Verified review

•Kate•Oct 6, 2024

Words truly cannot express how unbelievable our experience with Purity Weddings. From our zoom calls to our engagement shoot to shooting our wedding during the hottest weekend of the year, Anna and Vitaly showed nothing but care, attention to detail, kindness, vision, creativity and talent. I truly do not think there are better wedding photographers and videographers. Within a week after our wedding, they provided us with a sneak peek of some of the most beautiful shots, including a stunning 1 minute film, that I’ve ever seen of me, my husband, and our friends and family. I watch the 1 minute film that Vitaly made us every single day. And I spend hours looking at Anna’s gorgeous photos. If I can give one piece of advice to any couple getting married it’s that you should invest in the best photo package you can with Purity Weddings. When all is said and done, all you’re left with is memories and photos, and there’s nobody better to capture the beauty of every single detail you spent so much time putting into your wedding. Thank you guys!!!!

  * ### Amazing Team!

•Verified review

•Jessica H.•Apr 2, 2024

Choosing Anna & Vitaly to document our wedding was the best decision we made in this process. They took the vision we had, and enhanced it even further. There are many photographers/videographers who can deliver solid content, but it really takes a special team to be able to capture a certain "mood" and "aesthetic." We truly appreciate their responsiveness and willingness to go the extra mile. The quality of their work really speaks for itself (especially when you have multiple friends who inquire about the team behind our wedding photos!)

## Frequently asked questions

6 Answers

Ask them a question

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically, couples book us about 9-18 months before their wedding date. We're a boutique photo and video team that doesn't outsource and handles all post-production in-house. We limit the number of weddings per year, so please make sure to contact us as early as possible.

### Will you edit all our pictures?

All our photographs are individually, gently retouched, making sure your wedding day looks flawless.

### Do you work with assistants or other photographers?

All our packages include multiple photographers and/or videographers.

### Do you also offer video services?

Yes, while we do provide separate photography and videography packages, our specialty is the combined Photo+Video packages. This option brings you a cohesive team familiar with each other's work style and preferences, from managing the day's timeline to navigating various lighting situations.

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

A sneak peek of several photographs and a film teaser will be ready within 3 business days of your wedding day, while all photographs and the wedding film will be ready in 6-12 weeks following your wedding.

### Do you have insurance?

We do! Just let us know if your venue requires a certificate of liability, and we’ll send that over to them. We also have a drone pilot license.
