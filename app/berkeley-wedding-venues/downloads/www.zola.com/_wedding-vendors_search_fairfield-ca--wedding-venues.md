![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“My husband and I just got married at Jefferson Street Mansion and it was the most perfect wedding we could have ever imagined - it exceeded our vision! The whole JSM team was so amazing to work with and made planning as stress-free as possible. We stuck to the planning timeline they provided in the planning binder (which was SO helpful to have) and had everything ready in time. Our guests all raved about what a fabulous wedding it was. We customized the venue quite a bit bringing in our own decor and personal touches and it did not feel cookie-cutter at all even though it is an all-inclusive venue. I am so happy we chose JSM!! The recommended vendors were all outstanding, the food was delicious, everything ran smoothly during the wedding and I didn't have to stress about a thing. The mansion, ceremony area, and reception tent are all BEAUTIFUL. I could not have asked for a more perfect day.”Alexandra H., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/1cb206fc-f347-4815-84a4-94dca8dc013d?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/jefferson-street-mansion-by-wedgewood-weddings)

“We had a wonderful wedding - the Wedgewood team helped us create a meaningful ceremony and reception. The pictures online do not do this place justice - you have to see it for yourself! The grounds are beautiful; we had our ceremony at the pavilion and our reception in the garden area / in their indoor hall area. The venue definitely felt like a fairy / cottage core dream to me! Wedgewood also vendors that work with them and provide really excellent services - florals, music, cakes. If you want to have an awesome wedding and reduce your stress, I would check this place out.”Rachael A., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/hacienda-de-las-flores-by-wedgewood-weddings)

The space itself was truly breathtaking, with its amazing new upgrades and beautiful views. However, there were a few details that weren't properly communicated to us, which led to a bit of a rocky start. Although my bridal party and I had lots to deal with prior to ceremony start, these issues were not something our guests would have seen/noticed. To their credit, the Wedgewood team acknowledged their mistakes and upgraded our bar package to make up for it. Overall, the venue was beautiful and the staff did their best to ensure our day went smoothly, despite the initial hiccups.

![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We recently had our wedding at Suisun Valley Inn, and overall, it was a beautiful and memorable experience. One of the biggest highlights was being able to use the venue for three full days, which gave us extra time to relax and connect with our bridal party and loved ones. That extended access truly made a difference in how special the weekend felt. However, there were a few challenges that did impact our plans. The event barn, which was a key part of our original vision, was unfortunately not finished in time for our wedding. While we understand this was out of the owner’s control, we were disappointed that we were not refunded the full 2,000 deposit, especially since the change affected nearly every aspect of our day. Additionally, when we arrived, we were surprised to find the vineyard had been plowed without any prior notice. This forced another last-minute adjustment to our setup so we wouldn’t be facing a dirt lot. It would have been really helpful to have been told about that in advance. Despite these hiccups, the venue itself has so much potential and charm, and we did have a lovely wedding. I just hope some of these experiences can help future couples plan better or spark a few improvements from the venue for the future.”Analisa R., 8 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/024bd0c3-3769-4479-be04-a31009a3418e?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/suisun-valley-inn-at-monroe-ranch)

## About wedding venues in Fairfield, CA

### 

California offers an incredible 840 miles of coastline, 3,000+ wineries and ancient redwoods for your wedding day. When you choose the Golden State, you're getting exceptional natural lighting for your ceremony across diverse settings from Mediterranean coastal zones to alpine mountain backdrops. Each region has its own distinctive character that can perfectly match your vision.

### What Makes California Wedding Venues So Special?

Northern California's Napa Valley welcomes you with rolling vineyards and Spanish colonial architecture where intimate wine cave ceremonies create unforgettable moments. Head to Southern California and you'll find oceanfront venues like Duke's Malibu where you can exchange vows with the Pacific stretching out behind you while enjoying fresh coastal-inspired cuisine. Palm Springs offers dramatic desert venues with mountain backdrops and striking midcentury modern architecture that photographs beautifully.

### How Much Do Wedding Venues in California Cost?

Wedding venues in California typically run between $9,600 and $11,700 which aligns nicely with the national range of $6,500-$12,000. This represents about 18% of your total wedding budget. Your overall costs will vary based on guest count:

  * 50 guests: $26,190
  * 100 guests: $43,692
  * 150 guests: $60,141
  * 200 guests: $74,836
  * 250 guests: $89,530

### Which California Venues Are Fully Accessible?

The Griffith House features wheelchair-accessible pathways throughout its Spanish-style grounds including the private ceremony lawn and separate preparation spaces for couples.

Accessibility options have improved greatly across California venues in recent years.

### When Should You Book Your California Wedding Venue?

October leads venue inquiries in California with couples typically booking venues about 13 months (400 days) before their wedding date. If you're dreaming of a Northern California wine country wedding during peak season you'll want to book up to 18 months in advance. Southern California venues offer more flexibility especially during winter months when you can still enjoy beautiful weather while potentially securing better rates.
