## Frequently asked questions

12 Answers

Ask them a question

### Do you have on-site parking?

Yes, we have a small lot of 14 parking spaces (1 reserved for ADA). Free street parking is available in the immediate area and additional contracted parking may be arranged upon request.

### Do you have accessible facilities?

Yes, the majority of our facilities are wheelchair accessible. We have ramps at the main and side entrances, plus accessible lodging, restrooms, and event spaces.

### How many hours are included in our booking?

Your reservation includes eight (8) hours from start to finish, including the time it takes to set up and clean up. Additional rental hours may be added at a rate of $300 per hour.

### Do we need to get insurance?

Yes, we require all bookings to obtain a certificate of liability insurance. This can be added to homeowner’s or renter's insurance, or we can suggest a vendor. Exact price depends on factors like type of event, event duration, number of guests, whether alcohol is served, etc.

### Do you collect a security deposit?

Yes, we collect a refundable damage and cleanliness deposit that ranges from $500–2,000 depending on the size and nature of the event.

### What is the "environmental stewardship fee?"

Urban Adamah is committed to operating our campus with as little negative environmental impact as possible. This 3% fee helps cover the cost of environmental projects on site and is added to the final rental fee. Using funds collected from our rental program, we installed enough solar panels on site to cover 100% of our annual electricity needs. We also completed a site-wide grey water system that diverts used shower and laundry water from the Camp Street Residence to our perennial plants. This system saves us more than 20,000 gallons of water per year. Thank you for helping us make a difference.

### Do you prohibit any items or decorations on the farm?

Glitter and confetti are not allowed at UA events due to the difficulty to clean up properly. Candles may be used for ceremonial purposes, only for the duration of those services and not for decorative purposes. No push-pins, thumbtacks, or nails are allowed. Any damage to site from non-approved adhesive methods will be deducted from security deposit.

### What does a Site Host do?

Site hosts are available to help with the execution and flow of your event. They may set up and break down furniture, maintain restrooms, greet guests, answer questions and act as a resource should a last minute need arise. They also ensure safe enjoyment of the site, provide direction in case of emergency, and make sure the site is properly closed at the conclusion of each event.

### What are food serving & catering options for my retreat?

You are welcome to self-cater, work with a caterer of your choice, or use one of Urban Adamah’s preferred caterers. If UA’s kitchen will be used, there is a kitchen use and cleaning fee, which varies depending on the usage details. Please note that UA’s kitchen is vegetarian kosher, so it NOT available for use if meat is being served other than kosher fish.

### How do you get to the farm?

We are located at the corner of Sixth Street and Harrison Street: 1151 Sixth Street, Berkeley, CA 94710. In a car: take I-580/I-80, exit at Gilman Street in Berkeley. Head east five blocks. Turn left onto Sixth Street Continue one block to the farm on the right. Via AC Transit: take the 72/72R/72M along San Pablo Avenue. Use the Harrison Street/Gilman Street stop. Continue west five blocks to Sixth Street Visit Actransit.org for more information. Via BART: the farm is a one and a half mile walk or car service ride from the North Berkeley station. Visit bart.gov for more information.

### Is there anything else we should know?

The farm is a special place, full of non-human life. The plants and animals on here are our friends, and they require delicate handling to be healthy. Please do not feed our farm friends or enter animal enclosures unless accompanied by an Urban Adamah staff member. Please do not pick from the fields or trees, as nearly everything we grow here on the farm is donated to people in our community who don’t have access to fresh food. In general, please remind your guests to be kind to our living friends on the farm, and don’t hesitate to send any specific questions our way!

### Can we bring our own alcohol?

Yes. When serving alcohol, we require the rental group to be fully responsible for ensuring that no alcohol is consumed by any guests younger than 21. You may not sell alcohol as part of your event.
