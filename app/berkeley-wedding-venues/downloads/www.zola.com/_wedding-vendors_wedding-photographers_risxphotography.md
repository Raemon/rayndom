Hi, I’m Ris a photographer with a passion for capturing love in its most genuine form. With eight years behind the lens and seven dedicated to portraits, I’ve spent the last year diving into the incredible world of weddings. My style is classic and true to life, focused on preserving real emotions and timeless moments. What I love most is how every couple brings their own story, energy, and spark, and getting to translate that into lasting images is what makes my work so meaningful.

I take pride in creating a comfortable and relaxed experience for every couple. From our first conversation to your final gallery, I’m intentional about making sure you feel seen, heard, and cared for. My approach combines technical skill with genuine connection, ensuring every image reflects you.

Ris was an absolute pleasure to work with for our wedding. From our first conversation, they were informative, clear and incredibly helpful in guiding us through the photography timeline and plan for the day. Their communication style put us at ease and made the process seamless. Ris’ work is truly personable - they went above and beyond to make sure we got all the shots we wanted, even helping to curate an efficient day-of timeline so we could maximize our time with guests at the cocktail hour. As an added bonus, the free engagement shoot they provided was so helpful for sending out save the dates and setting up framed photos at the wedding. We couldn't recommend Ris more highly!

## Frequently asked questions

6 Answers

Ask them a question

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically, couples book me about 13 months before their wedding date. I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible about my availability, even if you’re planning on a shorter time frame.

### Will you edit all our pictures?

Definitely. All final images will be edited for color, saturation, exposure, and sharpness to ensure they look beautiful. I also offer retouching services like blemish removal and teeth whitening for an additional charge.

### How many pictures will we get?

You can expect about 80 to 100 images per hour of photographing. But keep in mind this estimate varies depending on your wedding package, number of guests, venue type, and other factors.

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

My turnaround time varies by season. Typically, you’ll be able to view your photos online about 4-6 weeks after your wedding. Within this time, you can also expect to receive 20 sneak peek preview photos within 48 hours of “I Do”

### Do you also offer video services?

No, I prefer focusing on photography only, so you can get the best wedding pictures possible! Although I can recommend so amazing videographers that I have worked with in the past!

### Do you work with assistants or other photographers?

Yes, I’ll bring one assistant photographer depending on the size of your wedding. Don’t worry, this won’t cost you extra.
