Golden Bell Music 5.0

  * Band or Ensemble
  * Starts at $4,500 
  * Serves Pleasanton, CA
  * Offer

Golden Bell offers a unique musical blend that packs a high-energy punch! The DJ/live fusion band, or DJ/live band hybrid, is always anchored on a DJ set but supported by live musicians. With all the energy and hype of a live band and the flexibility of a DJ, you won’t have to decide between hiring a band or a DJ for your next event or wedding.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Okay, seriously, if you're planning an event and thinking about a band/dj hybrid, you have to look into Golden Bell Music. Our wedding on June 27, 2025, at Viansa Winery in Sonoma, CA, was everything we dreamed of and so much more, and honestly, a huge part of that credit goes directly to them. We spent 11 months planning every detail, and booking Golden Bell Music as one of our very first vendors was hands-down the best decision we made. The band/DJ hybrid concept? Pure genius! It absolutely delivers the best of both worlds, and they pulled it off flawlessly. But really, the biggest shout-out – and the core of this whole review – belongs to the phenomenal Marlon Aldana, our DJ and drummer. We first spotted him in action on Golden Bell's Instagram, and it was an instant "that's our guy!" moment. You can imagine our excitement when we found out he was available for our date! Working with Marlon from the very beginning was just an absolute pleasure. He wasn't just playing music; he was genuinely feeling the room, intuitively knowing when to let a song build or transition to keep the energy up. All of our "must-plays" were there, the do not-play was respected, and the dance floor never once emptied And talk about flexibility! We had a last-minute idea to add an extra instrument, and the Golden Bell team didn't blink. They jumped right in, helping us find the perfect addition without any issues. Plus, we had a separate violinist for our ceremony, and it was so impressive to see how effortlessly all the vendors collaborated. No drama, just smooth, professional teamwork, which really speaks volumes about Golden Bell's commitment to making your day seamless. Now, for the ultimate highlight: our after-party! We decided to do something a little different and host it in a wine cellar, and Marlon and his team elevated it beyond anything we could have imagined. When they brought in a fog machine, the entire atmosphere transformed. It wasn't just a party; it was an experience! That fog machine honestly MADE the party, turning the space into something truly epic. I genuinely can't picture it having the same incredible energy without it, so a massive thank you for that unexpected, perfect touch. And because we had a masquerade theme, I asked if the DJs would wear disco masks and they SAID YES and wore them the entire time, even after I told them they absolutely didn't have to for more than one song! It just created such an amazing vibe, and we've got the pictures to prove how much fun everyone had! There's just so much to appreciate about this incredible group. If you want your special day to be filled with fantastic music, seamless execution, and an unforgettable atmosphere, you absolutely have to choose Golden Bell Music. They truly are exceptional!”Kayla M., 6 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/2fc92b8c-1340-41e8-83ed-4977854aae22?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/golden-bell-music)

He worked flawlessly with me, my partner, and our wedding planner to pull off an incredibly fun reception. Richard did an initial call with my partner to discuss the general vibe we were looking for, and we knew immediately he would be a great fit for our wedding. Richard gave us a helpful questionnaire to fill out key songs and general musical interests (and do not play songs). Richard was also happy to jump on calls with us to talk through our questions and hopes for our big day. I especially appreciated that Richard was able to play some German songs for some guests who had flown in from Germany, as that got even some of our older relatives on the dance floor. People were partying all night thanks to Richard! Richard catered to our wide age range of guests, and even gave us a couple of bonus closing songs that were the perfect conclusion to the night. We could not have asked for a better DJ.”Chelsea P., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/4115ccdf-dcf7-4cb9-8ac6-65414450fe8a?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/all-ears-dj)

I’ve been playing weddings for over twelve years and I love my work! My services cover any or all aspects of wedding & receptions. I have found my life’s artistic calling in becoming flexible to every type of music my clients could desire. I learn to enjoy whatever my clients love and this resonance makes my job sustainable and ever-enjoyable. But, I do tend to request the ability to make choices for the dance-floor that rely on my years of dance-enhancing experience. I meet with my clients to determine what music they would love to hear and what music they do NOT want to hear.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We found Brandon through our wedding planner Christine Garrison of CMG Events. She suggested him because we were interested in having someone play acoustic guitar and singing during the wedding. After chatting with Brandon, we hired him to play the guitar for our ceremony, act as a wandering minstrel during the cocktail hour, and DJ the entire event. Our ceremony took place outdoors in an open lawn area. Brandon did a great job with setting up the sound. Everyone was able to hear both us and the officiant clearly. The acoustic rendition of Heartbeats (Jose Gonzalez) and Wildflowers (Tom Petty) he played for our processional and recessional were beautiful and really set the mood we were looking for. Brandon also did a great job DJing the event. He was able to take a small number of songs and expand the playlist to not only fit our tastes but keep the party hopping. We had expected that we would have minimal dancing and that our crowd would mostly just sit around chatting. However, Brandon was able to keep the energy up and the dance floor going throughout the night. It far exceeded our expectations and made the night really memorable. He was extremely professional throughout the planning process. We had several calls leading up to the wedding, and he made it easy to communicate what we were looking for in the event. We added songs to a few different playlists which he used as a jumping off point. He also provided suggestions for all the important moments (e.g., processionals, recessional, first dance, grand entrance). His contract and other documents were also clear and always sent promptly. On the day of Brandon arrived on time for set up and did a great job with all aspects (sound, DJing, acoustic performance, and lighting) of the event. He looked extremely professional and was communicative throughout the day, constantly checking in with the planner and us to make sure everything was going well. If he wasn’t sure about a song, he’d ask before playing it. Best of all, he was extremely reasonably priced. His assistant, Josh, was also very nice and did a great job.”Liz, 7 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/1cebf972-3bdf-4908-b3cd-3108b35f5bcb?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/the-celebration-dj)

He was an excellent MC & he truly helped us plan our program out. We had no idea what we wanted as far as a “program,” but he didn’t hesitate to help us create a nice little timeline for our reception! Ardi also took the time to meet with us Via zoom prior to the wedding, to plan out the timeline & also discuss music of course! He provided all the vibes & played us exactly what we wanted. Our guests LOVED the old r&b love songs during dinner, I loved seeing everyone’s faces when he’d play certain songs! The custom light add-ons are definitely worth it too!

NODJNOPARTY Entertainment | DJ TNT Turning Moments into Memories — One Beat at a Time With over 17 years of professional experience, DJ TNT is more than just a DJ—he’s a vibe curator, energy architect, and celebration expert. Trained by his late father, the legendary DJ TeddyB, music is in his DNA. Every beat he drops carries a legacy of passion, precision, and pure joy.“Trecee was our DJ for our outdoor wedding reception, and he was amazing! My husband and I were originally going to just play music from our phone, but I’m glad that we found and hired Trecee instead! With no coordinator and last minute changes before and on the day of our wedding, Trecee remained professional, flexible, and fun as our DJ and MC! He followed our song cue list wonderfully, and helped us remix our first dance songs just how we planned. He made announcements we had set on the schedule as well as additional ones requested. He also made funny comments, which totally added to the vibes. His music choices were just what we were looking for, and even with a request by my family to switch to slower songs, he did it seamlessly; Fun, hyped songs for the younger crowd and romantic songs for the elders. He arrived about 45 minutes before his contract hours started to set up and even gave us (bridal party) warnings and updates on getting behind or on track of schedule! (Which is very helpful as, again, we didn’t have a coordinator.) Overall, he is a great DJ & MC, and my now husband and I would highly recommend his services! I will post more pictures once available.”Midore Q., 4 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/341dab4a-cfbb-4dd1-9919-18e66626d0fc?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/nodjnoparty-entertainment)

The icing to our cake was the dance party. The biggest complaint I got from our guests were that their feet hurt from dancing all night! Even my mother in-law said every time she tried to sit down, the DJ was playin’ another hit. Every single guest complimented us on having such a dope DJ and we would recommend Zhaldee for any event! I’m looking forward to working with him on some more events at his new venue! Y’all should go check him out!!!”C-oNe T., 3 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/zhaldee-s-eats-beats)

When good isn’t good enough and your worst fear is getting that cheesy DJ that your guests don’t like or won’t remember, Sounds Elevated is here to help!“This review for Zeb (and the whole Sounds Elevated Team) is long overdue. Zeb is not only an incredible musician in his own right but plays the role of musical conductor with equal panache. A true “Jack of All Trades.” Some of the many hats he wore for our wedding include: -He played solo guitar for our ceremony -Lined up a jazz quartet for the happy hour -Setup the party lighting (party but classy) for the reception -Setup a photo booth for guests to take fun photos (a big hit btw) -DJ’d with a live accompaniment combo for the reception \- stayed up way later than we asked him to, and DJ our afterparty (which was a VERY different vibe than the reception). He was hustling for easily 10 hours straight. And every single element he contributed to the festivities was top tier. My older cousin, a professional musician for many years, was blown away by the level of talent. It’s been almost two years since the wedding and we still get compliments about the entertainment. He and his team went above and beyond. Easily the best “value” for anything we spent money on for the wedding. I strongly recommend meeting with Zeb and gearing his philosophy/approach to weddings/events.”Kelsey D., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/sounds-elevated)

The whole team, from the lead singers to the sound and light techs, was amazing to work with. Every step of the way they were courteous, on top of the details, and available to hop on a Zoom or respond to an email with our venue and our wedding planner. They took it upon themselves to make sure power and sound were all taken care of *and* they even tried to make sure we had tenting for the outdoor wedding (it wasn't even their job) just to take a load off of our plate. I'd hire this band again and again, and, if they'll do it for our 5 or 10 year wedding anniversary. Thanks!”Cat & J., 3 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/ruby-wedding-party-band)

Dj Airsun Aka Ersson Bartle. It’s not a party if people don’t dance. DJ Airsun has been putting people in the mood to groove at parties, events, and clubs since 2011. Airsun’s experience spinning for diverse groups with different tastes means the dancing at weddings and private parties is always a blast and always curated for the people of the hour. “Whether it’s Latin or country, or hip hop or electronic, getting to learn the different styles through new clients, there’s always something new.” Airsun is fluent in an open format, commanding popular music of all eras and styles, so guests of all ages want to get on up and shake it on down.“AJ Airsun did an absolutely wonderful job DJing our wedding and was lovely to work with from start to finish - I would absolutely recommend her to anyone! We wanted a dance party, with songs that get everyone up and moving and she definitely delivered. The setup was perfect, even with the ceremony and reception in two different places (one of which was an outdoor park - they tucked the setup behind a tree!), and included really tasteful and fun mood lighting. My husband even told me about a couple last second changes (adding a new song to the processional while we were all lined up ready to go, and wrapping up one of the dances a little early) that she executed perfectly in the moment. Our reception was at the Outdoor Art Club in Mill Valley - a historic building and small town that both have a lot of rules about sound levels, and it all went perfectly while still feeling like a high energy dance party. We can’t thank Ersson enough!”Christina B., 9 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/airsun-productions)

While Major has been described as talented, friendly, and a strong improviser by colleagues, matt writes his own original music and spends time perfecting classical excerpts for orchestral auditions. Major channels the energy of the California spirit into his music, and his aim is to bring people from different cultures together.“Matt performed for the ceremony and cocktail hour of our wedding and it was amazing! He came and played everything perfectly. It was exactly what we had in mind for our Wedding. He was also very fun and collaborative to work with! 10/10”Ron, 6 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/matt-major-violin)
