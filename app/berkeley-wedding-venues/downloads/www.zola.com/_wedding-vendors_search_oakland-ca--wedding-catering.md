Sabores Komali 5.0 Oakland, CA

  * Starts at $1,750 

We’re Cinthya and Maya, a married couple and co-founders of Sabores Komali, a catering company rooted in Mexican tradition and community. Chef Maya was born in Acapulco, Mexico, and has spent the last 25 years infusing her food with warmth, creativity, and cultura. Cinthya, raised in the Bay Area by Mexican immigrant parents, brings a deep love for community to our work. Sabores Komali is a celebration of Mexican identity through food. Named after the comal—a traditional griddle and symbol of home—our work is about more than meals. It’s our way of continuing the tradition of Mexican hospitality; full of love, generosity, and connection.“We hired Sabores Komali to cater my mom’s 60th birthday party and couldn’t be happier with the experience. From the start, they were incredibly easy to communicate and organize with, super professional and responsive. The food was so good! We had a mix of small bites and a taco bar. The shrimp ceviche, empanadas, and esquites were all huge hits with our guests. My whole family couldn’t stop talking about how delicious everything was. The taco bar was also delicious, with a variety of toppings and satisfying protein options that really made the meal feel curated to our taste. Everything ran smoothly, and we felt really well taken care of. You can feel the love and care Sabores Komali puts into their food and service. Highly recommend for any special event!”Stefanie L., 7 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/029f5326-f202-43ce-95dd-8038780282de?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-catering/sabores-komali)

Hiring them was single-handedly the best decision we made in our entire wedding planning process. We knew we wanted our food to be a highlight, not an afterthought, and the Americano team delivered a culinary experience that was beyond our wildest dreams. Our guests are still raving about it weeks later! From our very first inquiry, their catering manager (Beni) and team were an absolute dream to work with. They were responsive, incredibly organized, and genuinely excited about creating a menu that felt personal to us. They took our vision and elevated it with creative ideas, turning the tasting into one of our favorite pre-wedding memories. They made the entire process feel completely seamless and stress-free. Now, let's talk about the food on the wedding day. Show-stopping. We had the burrata with prosciutto and fig jam for a starter, and people were losing their minds over how fresh and flavorful it was. For mains, the slow-braised short rib literally melted in your mouth, and the sea bass was cooked to absolute perfection. It wasn't just "good wedding food"—it was exceptional food, period. The presentation was stunning, the ingredients were top-tier, and everything was served hot and flawlessly. Multiple guests—including our pickiest family members—pulled us aside to say it was the most delicious and memorable meal they had ever had at a wedding. Americano didn't just cater our wedding; they created an unforgettable experience that became a core memory of our celebration. They are worth every single penny and then some for the impact they will have on your day. Book them. You will be so, so happy you did!”Ferid K., 6 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/67264d27-dcc9-4151-a16a-9d70ee487046?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-catering/americano)

Nora Spanish Cuisine 3.3

  * Starts at $3,000 
  * Serves Oakland, CA

Ñora Cocina Española is a full service catering company, serving the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond. We strive to bring you the essence of the Spanish dining experience, taking care of the details to ensure the event is as seamless and stress-free as possible. Ñora can handle everything from menu planning (including vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options), event coordination, rentals, decorations, staffing and more! Our team of experts can help make any vision into a reality. Whether it’s a spectacular wedding of 200 guests or an intimate gathering for 20, no event is too large or small.“My husband and I are from different cultures. We have relatives who think paprika is spicy and friends who love more flavor. We wanted food that would be a crowd-pleaser for all our guests. We were also on a strict budget. Every other caterer wanted to charge way more for food that didn't sound all that exciting. I was so happy when I found Nora. We went with three paellas, tapas, and a grazing board. The paellas were a big hit, and everyone got to have a delicious meal. It was also a cool experience for our guests to see the paellas being cooked. Alexa, Emily, and the staff were great, but they are quite busy, so communication can be slow. Overall, it was a great experience and I would definitely recommend Nora for your event. I knocked down a star because their communication skills aren't the best, but they were flexible on all our menu requests and were very accommodating to our last-minute timeline.”Happy B., 10 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-catering/nora-spanish-cuisine)

YOOSHI SUSHI CATERING & EVENT PRODUCTION 5.0

  * Serves Oakland, CA

I had my first shot at managing a sushi restaurant when I took over an empty section of the family restaurant and introduced sushi to my customers. It was a challenge that I will never regret accepting. It was fun, a lot of fun! I had the opportunity to work with some really talented and creative chefs. I quickly learned that it’s not just about having fresh fish anymore. Sushi dining has transformed into a culture. A culture built by imagination and creativity. With the help of GD and the support of my family, I took all that experience and fused it with my imagination and created Yooshi Sushi Catering and Event Production.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“I’m speechless from the service I received from this amazing sushi company. I loved the food, designs, and service!! I would recommend this sushi over any other ones. Amazing job for my wedding. Everyone loved the food and I’m looking forward to hiring this amazing sushi and event production company again!!”Yehuda C., 5 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-catering/yooshi-sushi-catering-event-production)

Chef John Alvarez, raised in the Bay Area, discovered his passion for cooking early, earning the nickname “tortilla boy” at 12 while working in his family’s restaurant.

For our January 2025 wedding at the stunning Seymour Marine Center, we envisioned a customized buffet that reflected our love for both Asian and Italian cuisine. Chef Alvarez not only met, but exceeded our expectations. He crafted a truly unique and delicious menu that perfectly captured our favorite dishes, leaving our guests raving about the incredible flavors and variety. Beyond the exquisite food, the presentation was impeccable. The desserts, in particular, were a feast for the eyes and the palate – beautifully presented and utterly delicious. In fact, the food was so captivating that we were completely swept away in the moment and even forgot to take pictures! That’s a testament to how much we and our guests were enjoying the culinary experience. But what truly set Five Course Provisions apart was the five-star service. From the initial consultation to the wedding day itself, Chef Alvarez and his team were professional, attentive, and genuinely enthusiastic about making our day special. Their friendly demeanor and seamless execution allowed us to relax and fully enjoy our celebration.

We provide a true taste and experience of Hawai’i’s diverse culture and flavor using only locally sourced fish and ingredients. Our unlimited customizable toppings bar creates a fun and interactive experience for guests to select their own flavors suitable to every palate.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Yvette & Scott from Aloha Poke Bar were so upbeat and enthusiastic as they spoke to us about their product. I could tell right away when they spoke about their food that it was high quality - and that proved to be true after the first bite of their fresh, delicious poke. The fish was incredibly fresh and flavorful, and I just wanted to keep eating more. Aloha Poke Bar provided an amazing catering experience for our wedding, and I would highly recommend them to any couple looking for a top-notch poke option.”Alejandra & P., 6 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-catering/aloha-poke-bar)
