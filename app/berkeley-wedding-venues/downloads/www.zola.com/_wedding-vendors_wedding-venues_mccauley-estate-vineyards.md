## About this venue

McCauley Estate is an unexpected gem, located on the outskirts of Contra Costa County, in charming Brentwood. Surrounded by grapevines, well -tended landscaping and a beach like lagoon with fountains, this palatial, Tuscan style venue is ideal for any special event. The outdoor area offers a large arbor overlooking the water, flanked by two stately palm trees, surrounded by lush greenery and manicured lawns. The Grand Pavilion offers an indoor reception area, featuring rows of arched windows to view the abundance of roses and palm trees, custom lighting to match your event design; and an inviting patio beneath romantic, vintage strings of lights. McCauley Estate offers an elevated standard of professionalism and attention to detail, and package options that allow ample room for personalization
