  * ### Great venue to work with 

•Verified review

•Tim D.•May 22, 2025

Fortino Winery was an incredible venue for our wedding. From the very beginning, the event coordinators were extremely helpful, responsive. They were upfront and transparent about their pricing (very important!). They offered several beautiful options for our event, allowing us to have both an indoor and outdoor space (we chose to have the ceremony outside and reception inside). We initially worked with Dawn, who was filling in temporarily, but during the planning stages of our wedding, Bri took over as event coordinator. She went over every single detail of our wedding day with us and worked closely with our DJ to ensure our timeline and schedule were dialed in perfectly. On the day of, Bri was on top of everything, making sure every aspect of our ceremony and reception ran smoothly. The food and beverage selections were great, with delicious dinner, appetizer, and drink options (They have a good variety of delicious wines, and Italian food they make there in-house!). Bri and her team made sure that we as the bride and groom were taken care of on the day-of by providing us with champagne before the wedding, our own appetizers in the bridal room afterwards, and our dinner delivered directly to our table first before the other guests ate (so yes, we made sure we got to eat at our own wedding). Overall, we were very happy with our choice to have our wedding at Fortino Winery, and would definitely recommend it to others.

  * ### Naturally Beautiful 

•Verified review

•Brittany S.•Feb 24, 2025

Getting married at Fortino Winery was an easy decision, both when booking and in hindsight. This all inclusive style venue took the stress out of wedding planning and left me the more fun parts. I really appreciated getting to focus on design and personalizing the wedding day, rather than tending to things like finding table and chair rentals or tracking down linens. From beginning to end, the staff at Fortino Winery made the whole wedding process feel smooth, doable, and magical. My two absolute favorite features of this venue are the scenery and the food. First, the scenery: the redwood trees are absolutely beautiful, both in person and in photos. They provided a surreal backdrop and feel for our ceremony (and reception), and every time I see photos or videos from our day, I’m still in awe of the trees. Then on another side, you have rolling hills of the vineyard, golden and effortlessly beautiful. Our sweetheart table sat in front of the vineyard, and we took our bridal portraits there too. No matter where you look, the scenery is natural and inviting. We had about 200 guests, and everyone that I’ve heard from (including my husband and I) loved the food. We did a tasting beforehand of course, so I knew how good the food could be, but buffet style can be hit or miss. HOWEVER, believe me when I tell you, Fortino does not miss. Everything they served was great, even for an event this size. I’m not kidding, so many people went out of their way to tell me how impressed they were with the food. One thing that was more of a happy coincidence: I love that the winery is a place I can visit anytime. The first time my husband and I went back after the wedding, it was like reliving a really good dream. Getting to sip wine, walk around, and reminisce was so much fun. I hadn’t considered this before the wedding, but in retrospect, I’m really glad the venue we chose is easy to visit, and I can’t wait to do this for years to come. I also want to credit the staff for making the day of operations go so well. Any hiccup they encountered was handled swiftly, quietly, and confidently. Fortino gave me the gift of trusting them, and in turn, I was able to be present and enjoy everything. My wedding day at Fortino Winery was one of the happiest days of my life, and I’m very thankful for the role they played in making it so.

I had the pleasure of providing DJ services at Fortino Winery, and it was an absolutely fantastic experience! The venue's ambiance is perfect for any event, with its spacious layout, stunning lighting, and top-notch acoustics that enhance the overall vibe. The staff was incredibly friendly and professional, making coordination smooth and stress free. I truly enjoyed working with such a great team, and the guests were an energetic crowd, which made the night even more memorable. I highly recommend Fortino Winery for anyone looking for a venue that offers both style and seamless service for their next event.

Response from vendor•Feb 24, 2025
