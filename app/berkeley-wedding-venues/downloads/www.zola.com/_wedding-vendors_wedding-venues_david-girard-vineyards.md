•Verified review

•Andrey S.•Jul 4, 2025

David Girard Vineyards was an outstanding venue for our wedding. Their communication throughout the planning process was on point - they were incredibly responsive and helpful in ensuring every detail was exactly as we envisioned. The quality of their work and overall value was worth every penny. They ensured everything was set up according to our specific tastes and preferences, from the table settings to the lighting. The staff was attentive and professional, allowing us to fully enjoy our special day without any stress or hiccups. We are so grateful to the team at David Girard Vineyards for making our wedding day truly unforgettable.

  * ### March wedding at DG vineyards

•Verified review

•Kylie R.•Apr 3, 2025

Our recent wedding at DG vineyards was incredible. The views were stunning and I think choosing this venue contributed to my wedding planning being so stress free. Also while being 6 months pregnant I never had an issue with them. The wedding director Justin was outstanding and so helpful. You will have your dream wedding if you choose this venue! They were quick and responsive when needing items and asking for help. Very supportive and professional. No one will regret choosing this venue and it is quite high end, as well. Worth every cent

  * ### Highly recommend DGV! 

•Verified review

•Nina H.•Feb 19, 2025

We absolutely LOVED having our wedding at David Girard Vineyards! The location is absolutely stunning and the DGV team is amazing. They went above and beyond to make our day run smoothly. Highly recommend for a CA vineyard wedding!

  * ### Luxurious venue, excellent staff! 

•Verified review

•Emily H.•Dec 10, 2024

David Girard Vineyards was an absolute pleasure to work with for my couples’ wedding. Their communication style was quick, casual, and incredibly accommodating throughout the entire planning process. The quality of their work and overall value was outstanding - the venue was open, comfortable, and absolutely beautiful, with luxury views everywhere you looked. They went above and beyond to work with me and the couple to ensure that nothing slipped through the cracks. Having the golf cart transportation throughout the event was an absolute game changer as well as the on-site hands-on manager, Justin! The friendly, easy-to-work-with staff made the experience all the more enjoyable. I highly recommend David Girard Vineyards as a top-notch wedding venue option, and I hope to coordinate more weddings there soon!
