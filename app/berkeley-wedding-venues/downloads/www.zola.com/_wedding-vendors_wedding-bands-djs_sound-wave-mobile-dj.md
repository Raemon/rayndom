  * ### Amazing DJ - Highly Recommend!

•Verified review

•Maritza•Jan 5, 2026

We had Sound Wave Mobile DJ for our wedding this past November at Casa Bella (Sunol, CA) and we can't recommend him enough! They were one of several DJ's our venue had us choose from. What stood out about David in our search were package options within our budget, being bilingual with English & Spanish, and the many reviews that spoke to his ability to read the room and keep events fun for guests of all ages. We ended up choosing the Dream package with some extras, so he provided the processional/recessional music for the ceremony, served as our DJ/MC for the reception, and provided additional lighting and the photo-booth - and we were so happy with all of it! He was helpful and communicative from the moment we had reached out, answering our many questions in a clear and timely manner. Even when he had some personal things come up, David was transparent with us and assured us we would receive his excellent services. Whether it was my idea for a video to play during the father-daughter dance, or having a mariachi band play during the cocktail hour, or how to navigate the dances with my recently fractured foot - David really knows his stuff and was a great sounding board for ideas we had and situations that came up. He also did such a great job with the open dancing song choices with our multi-generational and multi-cultural group - most of our guests stayed all night long, and we got lots of compliments on the set! The photo-booth was also a big hit, both the main one in the reception and the digital/selfie one for cocktail hour. It's been wonderful to have those photos and the playlist to look back on. Overall, we could not have asked for a better DJ for our special day. If you're looking for your wedding DJ, I highly encourage you to check out Sound Wave Mobile DJ!

  * ### Wedding DJ and Emcee

David from Soundwave Mobile DJ did an awesome job as the DJ and emcee for my wedding at Sunol’s Casa Bella Event Center! He was very organized, flexible, and informative about what he needed to make everything run smoothly. We also used his photo booth, and everyone definitely had a blast! The music, energy, and flow of the night were perfect. I would highly recommend him to anyone looking for a great wedding DJ!

We booked David from Sound Wave Mobile DJ at our wedding at Sunol’s Casa Bella on October 4th, and he was absolutely amazing! David kept the energy high and the dance floor full. He read the crowd perfectly and made sure everyone — from our friends to our parents — had a great time. He was also super professional and easy to work with throughout the planning process. We got so many compliments from guests about how fun the music was! If you’re looking for a DJ who knows how to make your wedding unforgettable, I can’t recommend Sound Wave Mobile DJ and David enough.

Had the best time working with David and his wonderful wife for our wedding! We went with The Diamond Package which had many services and added some extras! Each service was 11/10: DJ/MC, Photobooth, boomerang photobooth, Moving Heads On Totems,12 Wireless Uplights, digital monogram, Retro Audio Guestbook, and Cloud Fog Guns! The Fog gums were beyond fun to use, great photo opp where we used in the end and for our send off! All photos that were not picked up from the photobooth were also kept safely for us in the end to collect !Also before closing up each photobooth, they made sure we had at least one photo taken! Now that is what i call amazing service because you get so caught being the show of the wedding and can forget to enjoy what you purchased!! When choosing a DJ, we looked a lot for personality and if the DJ can read the crowd. Our venue had us choose from a list of partners and we chose to work with soundwave a year before our wedding because of David's interaction with us. When speaking to him, you can tell he knows what he's doing and completely understands how budgets work for every couple, and he sure knows all the music to play for each age group. He was able to work with us giving us amazing promos too. David is also very professional and patient! We were pretty last minute in our choices and made some last minute changes as well and David was amazing made it all happen!! So if you're looking for a DJ with many services, go for Sound Wave Mobile DJ! You will not regret it!
