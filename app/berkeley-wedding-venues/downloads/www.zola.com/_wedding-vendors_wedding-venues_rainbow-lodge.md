  * ### The best wedding weekend

•Verified review

•Ashley M.•Aug 15, 2023

Rainbow Lodge is an amazing venue! When we booked Rainbow Lodge we got the property from Friday afternoon to Sunday afternoon and 60 of our guests got to stay with us. This allowed for more time with friends and family during our wedding weekend and our guests had the best time. The lodge has a wondering swimming hole, beautiful lawn and wonderfully kept grounds. The Lodge itself has so much character and getting the whole space for the weekend was so much fun! Emily made the booking process so easy and was there to answer all our questions while we planned our wedding weekend. We were able to host both the rehearsal and wedding at the Lodge. I recommend Rainbow Lodge to anyone, it was such a special venue!
