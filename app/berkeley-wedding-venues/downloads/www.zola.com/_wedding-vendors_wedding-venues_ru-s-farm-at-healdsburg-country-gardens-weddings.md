## About this venue

You are at such an exciting point in your life. And you are already dreaming of your special day ... Ru's Farm is a truly wonderful place that combines the very best of Sonoma’s wine country and farm lands ... rolling estate vineyards, amazing gardens and lawns, and an incredible barn built in 1902. Towering over it all is our 100-year old majestic cork oak tree, which really does add a special magic to the whole place. The barn, gardens, lawn, vineyards and farm buildings are all places where you can create your own magic. The garden has an abundance of plants and flowers including lavender, roses, rosemary, and sage - along with fruit + olive trees. The lawn looks out over the vineyards + is perfectly situated to watch the valley glow as the sun sets. There are even farm cottages to get ready in before your guests arrive. We are all about the details + providing you with a breathless backdrop. We know these are memories will last for a lifetime, we would be honored to host you.

  * ### the best of the best wine country venue

•Verified review

•becca k.•Nov 17, 2025

Ru's Farm was the perfect venue for our wedding. From the moment we first inquired, the staff was incredibly communicative, helpful, and supportive throughout the entire planning process. The venue itself was absolutely beautiful - the charming cottage, the stunning tree overlooking the vineyards that provided the perfect backdrop for our ceremony, and the elegantly rustic barn where we danced the night away. Ru's Farm struck the perfect balance of timeless elegance and modern style, and the beauty of the property truly speaks for itself. We couldn't recommend Ru's Farm more highly as the ideal setting for a truly special and unforgettable wedding day.

Ru's Farm is truly one of a kind—there’s nothing else like it. It perfectly captures the charm of wine country while also evoking the feel of a French and European backyard, making it both unique and timeless. We stayed at the on grounds Cottage which made getting ready and all events so easy. Kristen was an absolute pleasure to work with; she collaborated seamlessly with my planner and made the entire process so smooth. We couldn’t have imagined a better place to celebrate.

  * ### Wedding Magic in Healdsburg

•Verified review

•Allyson G.•Oct 15, 2025

We just had our wedding at ru's Farm and it was truly the best venue. The location and environment itself is pure magic. Guests walk in on a path of lavender, making it one of the best smelling weddings we have ever been to, the dining took place under a cover of trees adding the perfect twinkle of light as the sun was setting, and the barn is the perfect space for dancing! Like many wedding venues in the area, Sonoma County noise ordinances means ending a little earlier, but we really enjoyed having a long, relaxing dinner under the trees over a late night of dancing. Plus, ru's is just a couple of minutes from town and it was easy to get to a late night spot. Communication with the venue was clear and easy and everyone we worked with was amazing. We would definitely recommend trying to book the VRBO on the property for your wedding because that just added to the magic!

Response from vendor•Oct 16, 2025

Allyson! Your day was magic and ru's was so honored to be a part! Thank you for taking the time to share your experience - wow, we are so grateful! Couldn't be happier for you + wish you a lifetime of health, wealth, and happiness! Congratulations!!

  * ### Ru's Farm

•Verified review

•Eve Z.•Aug 12, 2024

We had a magical wedding at Ru's. 100% would go for Ru's again. We lucked out with the weather but regardless, there is a lot of shade for guests (especially in the ceremony/dinner areas). The lighting is incredible. The lush lavender and olive trees makes the setting feel fairy-tale like and unique. We loved that everything was spaced out enough but also close together -- giving a homey/backyard and also elevated feel. Guests commented on how much they loved it too. We appreciated that you can BYOB. Ru's does offer some items to borrow but we elected to rent items for a specific feel (also note that you will be required to rent kitchen items such as an oven unless your caterer provides that). The cottage is also clutch and super nice. Working with Lele and Kristen was super great too. Having a hard time finding drawbacks!
