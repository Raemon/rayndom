Get a quote

I am a nerd who loves to tell visual stories. I own more lenses than pairs of shoes and I always think about the quality of light no matter where I am. I started out as a Zoologist, photographing underwater life, moving on to commercial photography, then falling in love with weddings over 16 years ago. I am lucky enough to work together with my husband, Tucker. We pour their heart and souls into our work, capturing memories that can be passed down for generations to come, with our mad camera skills!
