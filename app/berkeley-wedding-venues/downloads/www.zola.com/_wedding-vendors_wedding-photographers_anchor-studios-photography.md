I’m Edgar, an HTX-raised native with Salvadorian roots. I am the owner, creative director, and lead photographer at Anchor Studios Photography. I'm a wedding and elopement photographer based out of Pittsburgh, PA! However, the stories I capture don't start and end there. I love to travel to capture stories all around the world.

My goal as your photographer is to capture your milestones as candidly as possible. This is why over the years, I've worked really hard to build a unique photography style that can tell your story in the most fun way!

  * ### Best photo team ever!!!

•Verified review

•Daniela E.•Jan 20

Anchor Studios Photography was an incredible partner for our wedding day. From the moment we first spoke with Edgar, his communication was on point, attentive, responsive, friendly, and professional. The quality of their work was simply amazing - their photos are timeless, professional, and extremely detailed oriented. We were especially impressed when another photographer had to cancel last minute, and Edgar stepped in seamlessly, presenting his services to us in a very prepared and professional manner. Throughout the day, the Anchor Studios team was flexible, punctual, caring, organized, knowledgeable, and had great time management, ensuring our wedding day went off without a hitch. We are thrilled with the beautiful, lasting memories they captured for us. We couldn’t have picked a better team and would recommend them to anybody without question.

## Frequently asked questions

10 Answers

Ask them a question

### What's your pricing?

You can find my pricing and add-ons on my Zola listing under PACKAGES. The packages on my Zola listing are DISCOUNTED from what you will find on my website. Talk to me and we can also see if I can form something more custom for you as well.

### How do we reserve our wedding date?

A 10% deposit & signed contract is required to get your wedding day on my calendar. The remainder of your balance is due two weeks before your wedding day.

### What sets you apart from other photographers?

With years of training under my belt, I know how to pose and guide clients to make them feel relaxed while looking their very best. I use natural lighting as often as possible and make sure my sessions are intimate & fun!

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically, couples book me about 12 to 4 months before their wedding date. I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible about my availability, even if you’re planning on a shorter time frame.

### Do you work with assistants or other photographers?

Good question! I usually shoot by myself. Contrary to popular belief, second shooters are not typically needed unless you'd like extra angles of the special moments or more pictures per hour of service. I do offer my second shooters as an add-on. If I am traveling from out of town, I will scout the region for other talented second shooters months before your wedding day. Believe me, I am very picky when it comes to reviewing portfolios of the shooters I select.

### How many pictures will we get?

You can expect about 80 to 100 EDITED images per hour of photography service. But keep in mind this estimate varies depending on your wedding package, number of guests, venue type, and other factors.

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

My turnaround time varies by season. I try to give you a few previews within 24 hours. The rest, you’ll be able to view online about 5-8 weeks after your wedding day. I deliver them through an online album with high-resolution image files. Through this link, you'll be able to share the photos with your loved ones and even order prints.

### Will you edit all our pictures?

Definitely. All final images will be edited for color, saturation, exposure, and sharpness to ensure they look beautiful!

### Do you also offer video services?

I do not offer videography services myself but I know lots of talented videographers I can recommend. I could also assist you in your search for one if needed.

### What’s your back-up plan if you can’t photograph our wedding as planned?

In my many years of shooting, I’ve never cancelled a booking. In the very rare event that I’m unable to photograph your wedding, I’ll make sure you’re covered by one of my colleagues or my contracted associate shooters (I have 20+ people I can reach out to if it happens). I’ll also provide you with a list of photographers from the many networking groups I’m in, so we can decide on the perfect replacement.
