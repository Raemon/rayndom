Meg's Ceremonies 5.0

  * Offers 8 ceremony types
  * Starts at $575 
  * Serves Davis, CA

Hello and Congratulations! I have the best job in the world because I get to tell your story and connect you to each other and your guests. I love to have fun! As a former nurse and teacher, I am sensitive to individual needs and I am very comfortable in front of people.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Meg’s Ceremonies was truly the perfect choice for our wedding officiant, and we feel so lucky to have found her. From the very beginning, Meg made us feel at ease. She was incredibly communicative, always open to feedback, and quick to respond to our messages—no matter how small the question or how last-minute the request. It felt like we had someone in our corner who genuinely cared about making our ceremony reflect us, and that kind of support meant the world during such a busy and emotional time. In the weeks leading up to the wedding, Meg guided us through the process with patience and kindness. She took the time to learn our story, listen to our ideas, and weave them together into something that felt both personal and polished. We never once felt rushed or pressured; instead, Meg created a space where we could be ourselves and trust that she would bring our vision to life. On the wedding day itself, Meg exceeded every expectation. Her attention to detail was impeccable, and her comedic timing was spot-on—she had our guests laughing, smiling, and tearing up in all the right moments. The way she told our story was heartfelt and hilarious, striking that perfect balance between romance and humor that we had hoped for. Our friends and family still talk about how much they enjoyed the ceremony, and we know that’s thanks to Meg’s talent and warmth. Beyond the ceremony, Meg went above and beyond to make the entire experience seamless. While we were busy mingling with family and taking photos, she quietly took care of signing the marriage license so we didn’t have to worry about a thing. She even surprised us with a sweet goodie bag and a personalized book that matched the pastel and floral theme of our wedding—a thoughtful touch that made us feel so seen and celebrated. Looking back, we couldn’t have asked for a better officiant. Meg brought joy, professionalism, and genuine heart to every step of the process. The value she provided was exceptional, but more importantly, she gave us memories we’ll cherish forever. If you’re looking for someone who is warm, professional, and truly gifted at what she does, we cannot recommend Meg’s Ceremonies enough. She will make your day not only beautiful, but unforgettable.”Victoria D., 2 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/7c2f2fc4-02ce-4be2-b7d5-d515e1559258?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-officiants/meg-s-ceremonies)

Hello! I’m Daniel and I’m honored to be considered for your big day! From my home in sunny Sacramento, California, I work with couples to make their ceremonies memorable, meaningful to them and engaging for guests. I guide my couples through the planning process of the ceremony from brainstorming symbols of unity to ordering a copy of your wedding certificate from the county.“We couldn’t be happier with our decision to have D officiate our wedding. From start to finish, he was warm, professional, and incredibly thoughtful. He guided us through the entire process with ease, taking the stress out of one of the most important parts of the day. On the big day, D delivered a ceremony that was truly perfect. He thoughtfully incorporated the religious elements we wanted in order to honor and respect my parents' beliefs, seamlessly blended two different cultures and languages, and added a few nerdy, personal touches that made it feel uniquely us. We’re so grateful to D for helping create such a meaningful and memorable moment. Highly recommend!”Esther T., 6 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-officiants/a-guy-in-a-vest)

Ceremonies For Sacred Days

  * Serves Davis, CA

I collaborate with the wedding couple to design and write a deeply personal custom wedding script and then coach their designated officiant to deliver it with ease and joy. After officiating over 600 ceremonies, I am now collaborating with couples to design and write their wedding ceremony and then coaching a friend or family member to deliver it with ease and joy. Over half the weddings in the United States are now performed by family or friends because it creates tremendous warmth and intimacy in the ceremony. However, asking someone to write and officiate a complete wedding ceremony can be overwhelming if they have never done it before.](/wedding-vendors/wedding-officiants/ceremonies-for-sacred-days)

Hi, I’m Yvonne — Lead Officiant - Founder, and your personal hype woman for one of the biggest moments of your life. I am Texas based and I’ve married over 400 couples, and no two love stories have ever been the same. I started officiating as a tribute to my sister, who passed away unexpectedly in 2023. She loved us all deeply and wholeheartedly, and celebrating life’s big moments without her was the hardest part of losing her. Helping couples honor their journey and love story has been my way of healing — one beautiful, heartfelt ceremony at a time. Whether your vows are traditional, bilingual, or totally outside the box, I’m here for it. ♥![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“One of the best vendors we could've booked for our wedding.

Your ceremony doesn't have to be "cookie cutter" or "run of the mill." I work with all my couples to present a ceremony that truly reflects your relationship. My goal is to ensure that you and your guests experience a meaningful and entertaining wedding ceremony to start your special day.“We hired Pamela to officiate our October wedding in Massachusetts after searching online for LGBTQ-friendly officiants, and she was absolutely amazing! From our very first meeting, we knew we had made the right choice. She was professional, experienced, reassuring, personable, and so easy to work with throughout the entire process. Pamela took the time to get to know us and crafted a ceremony that felt deeply personal and true to our love story, which was so special. Several of our guests commented on how captivating the ceremony was and were surprised to learn that we hadn’t known Pamela beforehand. She also guided us through the marriage license process and made it very easy and stress-free. We would highly recommend her to any engaged couple looking for a thoughtful, inclusive, and exceptional officiant.
