First off, I want to say thank you so much Louis and your team for all the hard work you put into our wedding on 10.18.2025. From the start, we were doing a lot of diy, and it was a lot of people’s first wedding, so we were a bit lost at times. Louis was helping everyone stay organized, have suggestions, and went above and beyond. He even poured the drinks for our sweetheart table and helped with setting up the dessert table, which was a huge help since I forgot about it last minute! The music was awesome, bartender and his wife were amazing and so much help along with the rest of the team, especially with any last minute changes(such as figuring out the champagne toast which I totally forgot to mention!). The food was absolutely delicious and the brisket had everyone talking! Photo Booth was a hit! They were so flexible with any change that was made, and Louis just held it together for our entire wedding. We appreciate you all soooo much!! Thank you! We will be recommending you to everyone we know!”Masha E., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/c5cc938d-5a21-4373-a02d-eeeef4428f97?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-catering/event-advantage-catering)

YOOSHI SUSHI CATERING & EVENT PRODUCTION 5.0

  * Serves Turlock, CA

I had my first shot at managing a sushi restaurant when I took over an empty section of the family restaurant and introduced sushi to my customers. It was a challenge that I will never regret accepting. It was fun, a lot of fun! I had the opportunity to work with some really talented and creative chefs. I quickly learned that it’s not just about having fresh fish anymore. Sushi dining has transformed into a culture. A culture built by imagination and creativity. With the help of GD and the support of my family, I took all that experience and fused it with my imagination and created Yooshi Sushi Catering and Event Production.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“I’m speechless from the service I received from this amazing sushi company.

Chef Alvarez not only met, but exceeded our expectations. He crafted a truly unique and delicious menu that perfectly captured our favorite dishes, leaving our guests raving about the incredible flavors and variety. Beyond the exquisite food, the presentation was impeccable. The desserts, in particular, were a feast for the eyes and the palate – beautifully presented and utterly delicious. In fact, the food was so captivating that we were completely swept away in the moment and even forgot to take pictures! That’s a testament to how much we and our guests were enjoying the culinary experience. But what truly set Five Course Provisions apart was the five-star service. From the initial consultation to the wedding day itself, Chef Alvarez and his team were professional, attentive, and genuinely enthusiastic about making our day special.

Notre Ferme 5.0

  * Starts at $760

Michelin star sober chef creating experiences through food sourcing food all from local farmers. Showcasing seasonality and community. I bring their products to life in the most honest way possible—doing the bare minimum to each ingredient to preserve its authenticity and integrity. I believe it’s just as much my job to educate my clients about the ingredients I use—where they’re from and how they’re cultivated—as it is to create delicious meals.“Allyson and her team are simply the best. Notre Fêrme catered our wedding (May ‘25) and to this day a ton of our guests still rave about the food and service! We cannot recommend them enough.”Zach G., 4 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-catering/notre-ferme)

I’m Monique, the owner of Board in SLO, a Central Coast based charcuterie and grazing company! I create beautifully curated boards, grazing tables, and my signature mobile charcuterie cart (Brieyoncé) for weddings, welcome parties, and special events. I’m all about bringing people together over GREAT cheese, good vibes, and beautiful food. Every board and grazing table is made with premium cheeses, meats, edible flowers, and seasonal ingredients that look as good as they taste. Whether you’re planning a cozy gathering or a big celebration, I love helping couples make their day feel extra special (and delicious).“100000/10 recommend Monique with board in SLO. Her charcuterie boards are not only beautiful but absolutely delicious. Monique’s work really elevates any event, and I can’t recommend her enough!”Kelsey, a month ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-catering/board-in-slo)

  * Starts at $1,250 
  * Serves Turlock, CA for additional fees

We pamper your tastebuds with authentic African Foods. To us, it’s more than just food, it’s a brand. It’s THE JOLAS KITCHEN BRAND. We have created a brand, with some amazing loyalty. Our aim is to take you back to the streets of Lagos with the Jolasjollof, and if you have never been to Lagos you can enjoy what the Nigerian party Jollof tastes like. It’s cooked with parboiled rice in a mixture of carefully selected peppers to give you that authentic taste of Nigerian Jollof. Looking forward to bringing our flavors to your next event!“Jolas Kitchen catered at our wedding on December 27th. I cannot say enough good things about Chef Jola, she was so communicative, and made excellent recommendations and suggestions, which was so helpful to me as a first time bride who had never planned such a large event before. We were absolutely blown away by the presentation, and the care and attentiveness of chef Jola and her team. I have never worked with such thoughtful and kind caterers, they really thought of everything and made the night such a wonderful and stress free experience for us. The food was absolutely amazing and our guests could not stop talking about how much they loved everything, from the Beef Suya (my personal favorite) to the Cole Slaw, to the Jollof and Meat Pies, and the Puff Puff. A lot of brides don’t eat much on their wedding day, but I cleaned my whole plate and even took some home with me. Highly recommend!”Kylie K., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/27388cd0-7451-48d0-b2e6-c0d4d5803f92?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-catering/jolas-kitchen-llc)
