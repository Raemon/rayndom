  * ### Wedding book

•Verified review

•Christine•Nov 19, 2025

Wonderful to have a keepsake of all of our wedding cards!

  * ### Super happy!

•Verified review

•Lilly•Nov 18, 2025

Super happy with how my two books turned out - we did one with our wedding cards & our first child’s baby shower cards! Not sure if there was a way to customize it more, but I found the artists to be helpful and make changes so promptly! These are on our coffee table and we can’t wait for guests to flip through them. A nice way to reach for the cards/re-read them then keep them all in a ziploc bag in your closet!

  * ### Great experience!

•Verified review

•Katie•Nov 17, 2025

Efficient service and a great product that allowed us to get rid of the stack of cards from our wedding that we didn’t know what to do with! Would recommend to others to have a nice keepsake that you can leave out for others to enjoy

  * ### Great Keepsake

•Verified review

•Christie W.•Nov 14, 2025

We submitted our wedding cards and speeches to Plum Print and they did a great job making it into a beautiful book. If you want your cards in one place, highly recommend using this service!
