I had an art gallery show and celebration of living. The staff was quick to reply to my emails and generous with their support. The day of the art exhibit the staff was helpful and kind. They kept an eye on me better than my own family, bringing me food and drinks. The food was good and I had 7 passed appetizers and a prime rib carving station. I was so happy and impressed with my choice of venue.”Joy D., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/5cd1e0a9-22b6-42eb-b0c2-d1c2b4ad89b0?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/san-ramon-by-wedgewood-weddings)

“We had the absolute best experience hosting our wedding here. Natasha Norman was incredible to work with through the entire planning process. She was clear on pricing, set our expectations well, was incredibly responsive, and helped coordinate the event on the day of the wedding. We asked for some extra time to set up the room and, since the room hadn't been booked the day before the event, she let us come in the day prior to get everything in order. Natasha spoke with our DJ and coordinated for his set-up, which was very helpful. The team setting up the event also did the perfect job of setting up the tables and outdoor chairs exactly as we'd asked. I changed my mind on the arch at the last minute, and they had no problem making the change. The wedding was incredible, our guests felt comfortable in their rooms and were pleased they could bring their dogs so they didn't have to hire a dog-sitter. Everyone was impressed by the view and by the fact that the sun was setting behind the sweetheart table in the Bayview Ballroom. I also want to give a shoutout to the banquet manager who made us feel at home, kindly brought us beverages as we were setting up, and took care of us throughout the stay. I’ve received at least half a dozen compliments on the qualify of the food served, and I felt the pricing was very reasonable – especially when compared to other hotels on the water nearby. I also loved that the hotel provided us a contingency plan if we needed to move our outdoor wedding to the indoors because of rain or anything else. We truly felt special and valued and would use this venue again in a heartbeat.”Lindsey M., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-doubletree-by-hilton-berkeley-marina)

Built in 1902 by the renowned architect Bernard Maybeck in traditional Arts and Crafts style, it's designed to create a cozy, intimate feeling. The crowning glory of the club is the three-story Great Hall. With its vaulted ceiling, massive stone fireplace, and stained-glass windows featuring heraldic crests of the great universities of the world, it's reminiscent of many a European cathedral. Light from the floor-to-ceiling windows warms the redwood paneling and suffuses the Hall in a golden glow. Two charming smaller spaces are also available for functions. The Heyns and Seaborg rooms (named respectively after a chancellor and a distinguished University Nobel Laureate) both have French doors leading to a private outdoor area with a garden view. The Faculty Club has been serving its members and guests for over 100 years and will do everything possible to make your event successful and enjoyable.Why you'll love this venue

“The Omni made an incredible first impression on us. It’s a beautiful & grand space, but there was something very comfortable about it at the same time. That’s mainly due to Jano Paredes, our event coordinator. He was so welcoming & genuinely passionate about creating a special event for us. We toured two other venues, Julia Morgan & Webster Hall. While these two venues are beautiful, there weren’t nearly as caring or appreciative of our business as the Omni. The Omni made the stressful planning process enjoyable (we planned it in about 3 months!) & they were understanding when we had last minute changes & requests. They were also very flexible throughout the wedding planning. They even swapped out some of the beer in their package so they could bring in brands we liked better. Amanda Maggard is amazing. She managed the accommodations for all the guests. Many of our guests also commented on how incredible the check-in was. It was rainy that weekend, so the Omni was quick to offer complimentary umbrellas. They even gave each guest a free drink voucher at the hotel bar! Amanda also made sure I had everything I needed to be comfortable in the Presidential Suite, complete with champagne, ice buckets, & several glasses for my visitors. It’s a lovely space to take getting-ready pictures. I was originally worried the grand ballroom wasn’t going to fit our vision & was torn on using the same space for the ceremony & reception (they have another room available if you’d prefer not to do this), but it was gorgeous! The spaces felt totally unique between the ceremony & the reception. The grand ballroom really provides a blank slate to create something beautiful & it can be difficult to appreciate when it’s completely empty. The mezzanine where the cocktail hour was held is beautiful & needs no additional decorations & the dim sum buffet was a huge hit. Guests loved the reception dinner menu. We went with a plated dinner selection of sea bass, chicken, or oyster mushrooms. The crab soup was delicious & by far the most popular. The passion fruit cheesecake was exceptional, but we also offered our guests a lovely Marjolaine cake slice. Later that evening, the Presidential suite where I initially got ready was transformed into our honeymoon suite. We were greeted with chocolate covered strawberries, champagne, & two custom Omni robes with our initials embroidered on them (my new initials since I was changing my name). It was so touching that it brought tears to our eyes. The Financial District was the optimal neighborhood to host our wedding. It was very safe & picturesque. We had a several family members nervous about coming to San Francisco because of the negative media coverage, but they all fell in love with the city by the end of the weekend. I know Webster Hall wouldn’t have given us the same treatment (they didn’t seem to care if they had our business or not). Julia Morgan was wonderful, but with the Omni, we just had a feeling we’d be in the best possible hands by people who genuinely cared, & we were right. Now, we love the Omni so much that we had Valentine’s Day at Monte’s two weeks after our wedding & the hotel surprised us with dessert & champagne, as well as a card signed by their staff congratulating us on our wedding. It’s a bar we now frequent because of the quality of service, food/drinks, & of course, our wonderful memories there. The Omni was the absolute best decision of our entire wedding.”Seana P., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/omni-hotel-san-francisco)

“We loved the idea of booking a reception venue that already had an incredible staff in-house. GAMH provided us with great care and kind but honest input every step of the way. The event coordinator (the fabulous Mandy!), audio, lighting, catering, servers, bar service, coat check…..was perfection because the team is their own and prideful for the space and its legendary music history. It was special to introduce so many out-of-town guests to this beautiful classic of a venue in the heart of our city and dance the night away. We’ll never forget it and will enjoy attending shows that much more forever.”Emily R., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/great-american-music-hall)

“We hosted our wedding at the Presidio Officers' Club and had truly the most special, incredible day of our lives. It was clean, well-organized, with delicious food and friendly staff. Not to mention, the planning team at the Presidio, through Wedgewood Weddings, was truly best-in-class. Wedgewood prepared us so well, providing a planning binder and step-by-step instructions. They checked in with us multiple times, providing walk-throughs, and answering every question extremely promptly. We especially loved our planner and day-of coordinator, Christian, who went out of his way to make everything so seamless. Christian taught us how to do our ceremony, including little details such as hand placement, went out of his way to accommodate a creative painting engagement, and provided private time for us newlyweds. He was perfect! So grateful to this beautiful venue and our wonderful team. We will treasure our experience with Wedgewood forever.”Natasha H., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/4ee55ad9-e863-4cba-a1fb-b459a421b4da?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/officers-club-at-the-presidio)

“Both my wife and I are from bay areas so it was important to get married by the water. I can’t stress enough how beautiful this venue is. It’s pretty much all inclusive, you can bring your own booze, vendors and decorations. It includes a stay in their fabulous inn which is 4 bedrooms. Our whole bridal party stayed and it was the best experience. We decided to book the night before too. You can even take pictures on the Marina docks right next to the property (for a small fee). The place itself is so dreamy, we used one lawn for our ceremony and one for lawn games and our cocktail tables. Watching the sunset from the reception space and the sparkly lights on both lawns was just sooo gorgeous. Now for the team, they went ABOVE and BEYOND to accommodate our requests and answer all my hundred questions and they were so flexible with us when we had to postpone for Covid twice. We are incredibly grateful for the team. They shared all their tips and tricks and made our wedding perfect. The coordination between the wedding venue and our planner was flawless. And best part was the seamless delivery of our late night snack, hot pretzels! And the space perfect accommodated a photo booth which everyone loved. We finally got married in September 2023! I highly recommend as a wedding venue 10/10.”Ashley (McCullough) T., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-lighthouse-glen-cove-marina)

“Having our wedding at The San Francisco Theological Seminary was one of the easiest and best decisions we made when planning for our wedding! As soon as we stepped foot on the campus, we knew it was the venue we’d been looking for. Working with the staff here (big thank you to Jeremiah Jenkins!!) was low stress and straightforward. Many other venues we looked at just didn’t feel right and felt overly complicated. The grounds were beautifully rich with history and architecture and more than we could have asked for in a wedding venue.”Heather H., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/bb5b98cb-d8fa-4d6a-8fec-561973d2b369?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/university-of-redlands-marin-campus)

“We had our wedding at Boundary Oak in May 2024, and I can’t say enough great things about our experience—especially working with Angelique. From our very first tour her professionalism, warmth, and attention to detail were top tier. We toured seven venues before choosing Boundary Oak, and it was the combination of stunning grounds and exceptional customer service that sealed the deal for us. Our initial food tasting was decent—typical wedding food—but a new head chef joined about six months before our wedding. The improvement was noticeable and really elevated our reception meal. Our guests raved about the food! If I had to give any constructive feedback, it would be regarding the bridal suite. While functional, it could definitely benefit from an upgrade. Adding a private bathroom and a lock on the door would make a huge difference in comfort and privacy for the bride on such an important day. Overall, we had a fantastic experience at Boundary Oak and are so grateful to Angelique and the entire team for helping make our day so special!”Kamika W., 8 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/526916a5-33b6-4a5d-b664-51c4f00afa12?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-clubhouse-at-boundary-oak)

![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“One word: Perfect. As someone who suffers from severe anxiety, I can honestly say I have never felt more at-ease and confident than while working with the Wedgewood Weddings Redwood Canyon team -- they always had our backs, kept us on track, and made us feel taken care of. From the first venue visit, during the planning meetings, all the way until the rehearsal and wedding day, the professionalism, clear communication, planning resources, and organized approach made for a seamless experience. We worked with Allison as our Wedding Planner and Coordinator and I firmly believe that she is one of the main reasons our wedding went as incredibly as it did. Redwood Canyon, provides a planning binder as soon as you sign that includes monthly checklists ahead of the wedding to help keep you organized in between planning meetings. It is also filled with valuable information about the wedding planning process, examples, vendor questions, and general guidelines. It helped us structure the planning process without losing the ability to truly personalize our event. Every meeting we had with the planning team was concise, direct, and organized -- it helped us stay on track throughout the process and gave us the opportunity to discuss ideas and ask for advice (which they are also more than happy to give via email). Super responsive and accommodating -- we were so impressed with how easy the process was. We also partnered with their recommended Bakery, DJ, and Florist as part of our vendor team, and the coordination between venue and vendors was absolutely seamless...by the time the week of the wedding rolled around all the main aspects were locked in and we knew the event was in good hands. The wedding day itself was perfect. Allison served as our Day-Of-Coordinator, and together with Jacoby (co-coordinator), Liv (banquet captain), Liz (banquet captain), and rest of the team (cooks, servers, bartenders) we had the most incredible wedding. We arrived at the agreed-upon time on the day of the wedding, and from that moment onwards, the Redwood Canyon team took over to deliver the best experience. They were organized, calm, kept us well hydrated and fed, and kept everything on track for us all night. We were able to confidently hand off the reins -- we didn't have to think of anything all day other than having a good time and enjoying our day as much as possible, trusting that all the logistics were in good hands. Overall, the venue itself was gorgeous. We had our ceremony in the Arbor Lawn, our Reception in the Grand Ballroom (we initially chose the venue primarily because of the dance floor), and rented out the Rose Room for the Cocktail Hour. Everything was included and beautifully decorated with all our desired personal touches, the food and drinks were delicious, and the planning and coordination services must be some of the best in the business. I can't imagine a more incredible experience than what we had and am so thankful for the Redwood Canyon team's care and professionalism -- especially Allison, who we were fortunate enough to work with from first meeting through the day-of. The wedding day went off without a hitch and I couldn't recommend the Redwood Canyon team more 3”Marina F., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/d5dda06b-10b8-4021-a2a3-f9a3854be326?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/redwood-canyon-by-wedgewood-weddings)

“Hiddenbrooke Hills was a gorgeous venue and the team at Wedgewood Weddings made our day absolutely memorable! I really wanted something that felt like a garden wedding and this place definitely delivered. We had a gorgeous garden ceremony but we were through the moon about the pavilion, it looked so elegant! The entire day was so fun and easy with the help of my Wedgewood Weddings coordinator and banquet captain who made sure my husband and I were taken care of the entire day. If there were issues, I wasn't aware because they were so on top of taking care of everything. Thank you so much Wedgewood Weddings for making our wedding day amazing!”Maria & J., 3 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/hiddenbrooke-hills-by-wedgewood-weddings)

“Fairview Crystal Springs was an absolute dream venue for our wedding! From the moment we first reached out, the team - especially Lindsey and Abbie - were incredibly responsive, quick to help, and went above and beyond to make our day magical. The venue itself is truly stunning, with beautiful grounds and an amazing crew that handled any issues we had with such care and ease. Everything felt seamless and the final result was absolutely breathtaking - I couldn't have asked for a better team or experience! The Fairview Crystal Springs team made our dream wedding a reality, and I would highly recommend them to any couple looking for an amazing venue with an even more amazing crew.”Angela M., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/923beb3e-2420-4342-83cd-2df8b3c79957?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/fairview-crystal-springs)

“The pricing on here is wrong. The venue fee alone is almost 30k. Then the food and beverage minimum is 50k but if you have 150 guests you will spend more like 80k. Plus there is a service fee of at least 13k. So BEFORE photographer, footwear, videographer, band, decor etc. you’re already at around 123k.”Jane, 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/stanly-ranch)

“We hosted an Anniversary Party at the Hall of the Above was nothing short of spectacular. From the moment we arrived, the energy was electric, the atmosphere elegant, and the celebration truly fitting for such a milestone event. I’ve been obsessed with the Hall opening, and it did not disappoint! We wanted to give our milestone anniversary recipients a wow-worthy experience, and the Hall delivered—blending historic charm with modern vibes in the best way possible. We couldn’t have asked for better hosts than Diane and Rod—their hospitality and attention to detail made the night seamless and special, right down to accommodating my light color change requests. We’re already looking forward to booking at Hall of the Above again!

“The communication from The Estate Yountville team was not the best, but when things went wrong, they did correct them promptly. I wish more of their team members were on the same page from all departments, but overall, the quality of their work and value was unbeatable. We wanted a 5-star wedding experience, and that's exactly what we got - it was perfection from the food to the service to the stunning venue space. Michelle drove us around the entire property in golf carts for photos all day, and they were so kind to take down the netting on the vineyard itself so our favorite part of the venue could shine. It was truly the perfect day, and I couldn't have asked for a better experience for the price.”Haven W., 4 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/45bc6052-ed46-4d24-b85c-0c267b78fcd3?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-estate-yountville)
