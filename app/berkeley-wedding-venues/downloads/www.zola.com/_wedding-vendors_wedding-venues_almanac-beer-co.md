•Verified review

•N B.•Nov 29, 2024

Almanac Beer Co. was the perfect venue for our wedding reception. From the moment we reached out, their communication was easy, efficient, and extremely organized - making the planning process a breeze. The space was large yet had a laid back and cozy vibe that our guests raved about. The staff was attentive and ensured everything ran smoothly so we could truly enjoy ourselves. We couldn't have asked for a better value or a more memorable wedding celebration at Almanac Beer Co.
