As your partner in the planning process, I'll help uncover goals and priorities, providing timelines and to-do lists that work without the overwhelm. I work closely with vendors and communicate the expectations for the wedding day so everyone is on the same page and can execute a seamless experience for couples and their guests.

Wedding planning has allowed me to combine my background in creative project management with my passion for customer service and experiences. I’ve been fortunate to work with amazing couples and collaborate with incredibly talented and passionate vendors, such as florists, photographers, caterers, and venues. Wedding production is a team sport, and I love bringing people together to create events and experiences that inspire, engage, and entertain!

  * ### Sam made our wedding the best day of our lives!!

•Verified review

•Yekaterina B.•Nov 29, 2024

We are so happy we had Sam planning our wedding! She was there to help, guide, and encourage every step of the way. I never felt overwhelmed or frustrated because I had her to lean on. I had a specific vision, but also a budget, and Sam helped me figure out how to make my dream wedding come to life within the constraints of money and space. On the day of the wedding, Sam made it absolutely seamless!! We didn't worry about a thing, and everything went incredibly well. We truly got to enjoy our wedding day without having to stress, coordinate, or do any last-minute things. We are SO grateful that we gave it all over to Sam. Can't wait for the vow renewal - we'll be hiring her again!

  * ### Samantha Gruwell Wedding Coordinator 

•Verified review

•Melanie G.•Nov 27, 2024

We had the most wonderful experience working with Samantha Gruwell for our Nov 2021 Deer Park Villa wedding. She did the month of coordination and it was the best decision we could have made. We were feeling overwhelmed with all of the details that still needed ironed out those last few weeks leading up the wedding, and Sam was so helpful in getting everything organized, and really put us at ease. She took control of communication with all our vendors (venue, photographer, caterer, DJ, florist) and ensured our special day had a well planned schedule that ran seamlessly. Sam was so hands-on throughout the entire process. We did multiple zoom calls to go over details and questions, and she did a walk through of the venue with us a few weeks prior. She helped us organize our rehearsal to ensure the ceremony had the right timing and flow. And she helped us perfectly execute it on the day of. She even stuck around through the very end of the evening and helped to dismantle some of the flowers and decor. Sam really put her heart and soul into ensuring our wedding day went flawlessly, and she’s also one of the kindest, most thoughtful people you’ll meet. Our wedding was an absolute dream, and we owe it all to Sam for making our dream a reality! Cannot recommend her enough for your wedding planning needs.
