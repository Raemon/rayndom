“Having our wedding at The San Francisco Theological Seminary was one of the easiest and best decisions we made when planning for our wedding! As soon as we stepped foot on the campus, we knew it was the venue we’d been looking for. Working with the staff here (big thank you to Jeremiah Jenkins!!) was low stress and straightforward. Many other venues we looked at just didn’t feel right and felt overly complicated. The grounds were beautifully rich with history and architecture and more than we could have asked for in a wedding venue.”Heather H., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/bb5b98cb-d8fa-4d6a-8fec-561973d2b369?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/university-of-redlands-marin-campus)

“We hosted an Anniversary Party at the Hall of the Above was nothing short of spectacular. From the moment we arrived, the energy was electric, the atmosphere elegant, and the celebration truly fitting for such a milestone event. I’ve been obsessed with the Hall opening, and it did not disappoint! We wanted to give our milestone anniversary recipients a wow-worthy experience, and the Hall delivered—blending historic charm with modern vibes in the best way possible.
