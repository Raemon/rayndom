## About this venue

Olympic Valley Stables is one of the most beautiful, untouched and historic pieces of property throughout North Lake Tahoe. With unobstructed views of the mountain and 4 acres of green & golden meadow, our location offers a unique rustic aesthetic that will bring you back into time. Once a fully operational riding stable with over 50 horses and ponies, we now use the property for events and weddings to maintain and restore its rich history for all to enjoy!

  * ### The perfect mountain venue

•Verified review

•Hannah•Dec 12, 2025

From the moment we toured Olympic Valley Stables, it just felt right. The setting, the openness, and the mountain backdrop immediately stood out, and we both knew this was where we wanted to get married. It is an incredibly beautiful venue and truly the perfect location for an outdoor mountain wedding. It had everything we were looking for in a venue and more. On the wedding day, the space was even more stunning than we remembered. Our guests could not stop talking about the views and how special the setting felt. There is something really calming and grounding about being surrounded by the mountains, and it made the entire day feel meaningful and unforgettable. One of the things we loved most about Olympic Valley Stables is how versatile the space is. It feels like a blank canvas in the best way, allowing you to make the day completely your own. Mich and Sarah were kind, welcoming, and patient. We were able to bring our vision to life while still letting the natural beauty of the venue shine through. We are so grateful we were able to get married here and cannot imagine a better place to have celebrated our wedding.

  * ### Wedding venue 

•Verified review

•Nina M.•Oct 7, 2025

We got married here in September and we are still in awe of our beautiful celebration! The stables was the perfect venue with stunning views and an intimate space that made our wedding day so special. Mich was so great to work with and all the vendors they connected us to were very professional. If we were doing it all again, we would pick the stables every time!

  * ### Magical & beautiful wedding venue

•Verified review

•Krista D.•Sep 9, 2025

We recently had our wedding at the Olympic valley stables and it was incredible. The venue offers lots of flexibility so it was awesome to create a day that felt unique to us, which included a shot-ski, beer donkeys, and a light up dance floor. The views from the venue are unlike anything else and every single one of your guests will tell you how beautiful it is. Yes it is all outside but with a few thoughtful touches we were able to keep every one warm through out the night. Mich was great to work with and really went above and beyond. If you are looking for a truly magical venue that you can make feel like yourself, I would highly recommend.

  * ### An absolute dream come true!

•Verified review

•Nataliya•Aug 8, 2025

Getting married at Olympic Stables was an absolute dream. The land feels sacred, grounded, and unlike any other venue in Tahoe. Mich went above and beyond to help us create a meaningful, personalized celebration. He was kind, flexible, and truly cared. It didn’t feel like just a rental of a venue—it felt like we were welcomed into something truly special. If you want a beautiful, soulful space with a team that honors your vision and the land, this is the place. Highly recommend!
