Our wedding took place at Orchard Creek Lodge on August 16, 2025. It was absolutely perfect and we owe it to Judi and the incredible team at To Have and To Hold Wedding Planning. From the very beginning, Judi was a dream to work with. She was endlessly patient, incredibly sweet, and always made us feel like our vision truly mattered. Throughout the entire planning process, Judi guided us with such grace and calm, even when we were overwhelmed with decisions. Her eye for detail is unmatched, every flower, every table setting, and every timeline detail was flawless. She anticipated things we never would have thought of and made sure the day ran seamlessly from start to finish. One of the highlights of our planning journey was our monthly check-in calls with Judi. My husband and I genuinely looked forward to them every time! She made each meeting fun, organized, and reassuring turning what could have been a stressful process into something we actually enjoyed. What stood out most was how genuinely caring and kind Judi was. She went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable, happy, and stress-free. We truly felt supported every step of the way, and it’s clear that she pours her heart into what she does. Our wedding day was everything we dreamed of and more, and we couldn’t have done it without her. Judi will always hold a special place in our hearts. she is the wedding planner every bride and groom deserves! Thank you, Judi, for making our special day unforgettable! The Fergusons!

•Verified review

•Yvonne R.•Nov 6, 2025

We recently had our wedding in October and hired Judi’s full wedding planning package for our 102-guest celebration. When we decided to host our wedding on a private property, we quickly realized how much coordination and attention to detail it would take to bring our vision to life. After our first consultation call with Judi to discuss day-of coordination, we immediately knew we wanted her on board for the full planning process. From the very beginning, Judi was a joy to work with — warm, attentive, and genuinely caring toward her couples. Throughout the year-long planning process, she guided us with her expertise, helped us make confident decisions, and connected us with amazing vendors who matched our style and budget. Judi kept us organized and on track every step of the way. When the wedding day finally arrived, she and her team went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly and looked exactly as we envisioned — it truly was the most magical day. We are so grateful to have had Judi as our planner. Our wedding wouldn’t have been the same without her!

  * ### Judi & her team made magic happen!

•Verified review

•Greg•Oct 1, 2024

Hiring Judi and her team (Sean & Shari) as our “All-Inclusive” wedding planner was the BEST decision we made during the entire wedding planning process! We were married on August 3rd, 2024, at a private residence estate in Sausalito, Ca. with 225 guests in attendance and we’re absolutely THRILLED with the amazing, “above and beyond” service and magical wedding experience Judi created and delivered! Being in our early 40’s, my wife and I have attended countless weddings of friends and family members over the years, and nearly all of them hired a wedding planner or coordinator to keep everything running smoothly and on-time. It was at one of these wedding where we had the pleasure of meeting Judi and her team, and it didn’t take us long to realize that their experience, talent, professionalism and execution stood FAR above the rest. Their commitment to every unique, elegant design detail, their ability to keep every element of the ceremony and reception seamlessly on-time, their warmth and kindness to everyone at the event, and the care and attention they provided to the newlyweds during the entire celebration was beyond compare. We knew then that when it came time to hire a wedding planner, Judi was the one we would choose. To Have & To Hold Wedding Planning navigated all the details and nuances of the entire wedding planning process perfectly! From her open, thoughtful, and helpful communication, creative ideas that made our event uniquely personal and told our love story, their tireless work ethic and ;awless execution of every timed element, to their sincere collaboration with all our vendors, our wedding day was EVERYTHING we dreamed of, and so much more and it is all because of Judi and her team. Hiring To Have & To Hold Wedding Planning will be the best decision you make!!
