![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We recently had our wedding at Suisun Valley Inn, and overall, it was a beautiful and memorable experience. One of the biggest highlights was being able to use the venue for three full days, which gave us extra time to relax and connect with our bridal party and loved ones. That extended access truly made a difference in how special the weekend felt. However, there were a few challenges that did impact our plans. The event barn, which was a key part of our original vision, was unfortunately not finished in time for our wedding. While we understand this was out of the owner’s control, we were disappointed that we were not refunded the full 2,000 deposit, especially since the change affected nearly every aspect of our day. Additionally, when we arrived, we were surprised to find the vineyard had been plowed without any prior notice. This forced another last-minute adjustment to our setup so we wouldn’t be facing a dirt lot. It would have been really helpful to have been told about that in advance. Despite these hiccups, the venue itself has so much potential and charm, and we did have a lovely wedding. I just hope some of these experiences can help future couples plan better or spark a few improvements from the venue for the future.”Analisa R., 8 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/024bd0c3-3769-4479-be04-a31009a3418e?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/suisun-valley-inn-at-monroe-ranch)

“Having our wedding at The San Francisco Theological Seminary was one of the easiest and best decisions we made when planning for our wedding! As soon as we stepped foot on the campus, we knew it was the venue we’d been looking for. Working with the staff here (big thank you to Jeremiah Jenkins!!) was low stress and straightforward. Many other venues we looked at just didn’t feel right and felt overly complicated. The grounds were beautifully rich with history and architecture and more than we could have asked for in a wedding venue.”Heather H., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/bb5b98cb-d8fa-4d6a-8fec-561973d2b369?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/university-of-redlands-marin-campus)

“We hosted our wedding at the Presidio Officers' Club and had truly the most special, incredible day of our lives. It was clean, well-organized, with delicious food and friendly staff. Not to mention, the planning team at the Presidio, through Wedgewood Weddings, was truly best-in-class. Wedgewood prepared us so well, providing a planning binder and step-by-step instructions. They checked in with us multiple times, providing walk-throughs, and answering every question extremely promptly. We especially loved our planner and day-of coordinator, Christian, who went out of his way to make everything so seamless. Christian taught us how to do our ceremony, including little details such as hand placement, went out of his way to accommodate a creative painting engagement, and provided private time for us newlyweds. He was perfect! So grateful to this beautiful venue and our wonderful team. We will treasure our experience with Wedgewood forever.”Natasha H., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/4ee55ad9-e863-4cba-a1fb-b459a421b4da?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/officers-club-at-the-presidio)

“We loved the idea of booking a reception venue that already had an incredible staff in-house. GAMH provided us with great care and kind but honest input every step of the way. The event coordinator (the fabulous Mandy!), audio, lighting, catering, servers, bar service, coat check…..was perfection because the team is their own and prideful for the space and its legendary music history. It was special to introduce so many out-of-town guests to this beautiful classic of a venue in the heart of our city and dance the night away. We’ll never forget it and will enjoy attending shows that much more forever.”Emily R., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/great-american-music-hall)

“We hosted an Anniversary Party at the Hall of the Above was nothing short of spectacular. From the moment we arrived, the energy was electric, the atmosphere elegant, and the celebration truly fitting for such a milestone event. I’ve been obsessed with the Hall opening, and it did not disappoint! We wanted to give our milestone anniversary recipients a wow-worthy experience, and the Hall delivered—blending historic charm with modern vibes in the best way possible.

“(Review for catering/events/venue service) I don’t have enough great words for Nicole and her team at Berkeley City Club. I planned my wedding entirely “remotely” from out of state and Nicole was always ready to answer my millions of questions and make sure everything was being planned to perfection. I had actually never seen the hotel in person, and I must say the architecture, foliage, vibes, etc are better and MORE stunning in person than in photos. Truly a breathtaking venue that transports you with its historic arches, details, etc. Wedding food is often lackluster in my experience, but I was thoroughly impressed by all of the plated dinner dishes we were served. My salmon was perfectly cooked and guests complimented their meals as well. They were also able to accommodate all gluten free food as I have celiac disease, which was the cherry on top. Additionally, a special shout out to the staff who worked the event day-of. Everyone was kind with bright smiles, and treated me and everything/everyone else with care.”Mariana S., 3 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/berkeley-city-club)

Built in 1902 by the renowned architect Bernard Maybeck in traditional Arts and Crafts style, it's designed to create a cozy, intimate feeling. The crowning glory of the club is the three-story Great Hall. With its vaulted ceiling, massive stone fireplace, and stained-glass windows featuring heraldic crests of the great universities of the world, it's reminiscent of many a European cathedral. Light from the floor-to-ceiling windows warms the redwood paneling and suffuses the Hall in a golden glow. Two charming smaller spaces are also available for functions. The Heyns and Seaborg rooms (named respectively after a chancellor and a distinguished University Nobel Laureate) both have French doors leading to a private outdoor area with a garden view. The Faculty Club has been serving its members and guests for over 100 years and will do everything possible to make your event successful and enjoyable.Why you'll love this venue

“We were looking for a beautiful low key venue for our wedding. The Lighthouse was by far even better than we imagined! We primarily worked with Maggie who was fantastic! She was very realistic when it came to helping us stay within our budget and gave us some excellent vendor recommendations accordingly. We had a few meetings with her along the way and she listened to what we wanted and helped us stay on task getting everything sorted out. She was super flexible and accommodating with us on the day of the wedding. Maggie and Alma were both there the day of the wedding and they were both busy making sure everything was running smoothly! In addition to how wonderful they are, this venue is the most beautiful! We used the outside and inside area. We heard from several of our guests that it was the most beautiful venue (and wedding ;) ) they had attended! We have the absolute best memories from this day and wouldn’t change a thing!”Rachel D., 3 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-lighthouse-glen-cove-marina)

“The Terrace Room was the perfect venue for our wedding day. From the very beginning, the staff, especially Candi and Bryon, were friendly, simple, quick, and incredibly helpful in planning our wedding all the way from Paris. They gave us great tips on vendors that really helped make our day magical. The venue itself is beautiful, with a lovely art deco style that felt elegant and unique. Our guests raved about the gorgeous space, the friendly staff (bar tenders, ...), and how well everything came together to make our wedding day truly perfect. We couldn't be happier with The Terrace Room and highly recommend it to any couple looking for a stunning, stress-free wedding experience.”Cécile E., a month ago![](https://images.zola.com/9768bad4-fae6-47f7-b78a-a75d617dee29?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-terrace-room)

Gardens are beautiful, perfect setting for 100 person event or smaller more intimate gatherings in the home. Affordable from every perspective, it is permitted to bring in your own beverages, catering and other vendors which saves a bunch! Most venues require the renters to use their vendors and buy their beverages which adds up to a lot, quickly. We used Wine Country Paella who were so amazing! Hidden gem, new management who are great to work with. Unlikely to be hidden for much longer.”Richard Lexington IV, 4 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-maysonnave-house)

“I rented the Tomales Town Hall for my fiftieth birthday. There was torrential rain outside but the hall was warm and cozy. We had an eight-piece band up on the stage and they sounded fantastic with the acoustics in the room. We had an area cleared up front for dancing and the small round tables in the back with tablecloths and electric candles on them. We served wine and beer from the bar.

“We loved working with our Hacienda De Las Flores team for our wedding! Johnny was our day of coordinator wand was wonderful. With our schedules being so busy we could not imagine planning this wedding without the WW team which for us took care of most things for us (food, decor, drinks, DJ). We appreciated the planning materials, binder, meetings which helped keep us on track. As my sister joked even if we did nothing, the wedding would still be great! We went with the recommended florist (A love is in bloom) and bakery (Old towne danville) and thought both were wonderful. We did chose our own Officiant and Photographer however. The venue is gorgeous and the weather thankfully cooperated for a beautiful early fall day. They were great about working with us and our decor ideas and playlist ideas. We loved our wedding! The only downside to be aware of is the noise ordinance which prevents use of microphones in the outdoor patio during reception (only pre-recorded sound/speech is ok). this was not ideal but we knew this was the case when we booked the venue because it is that gorgeous. We did speeches indoors in the dance hall which worked out fine though not ideal. We also had a tiny sound mishap during our grand entrance due to the pre-recorded nature of things but overall not a big deal. Overall think this venue is awesome and would recommend though of course depends on what's most important to you!”Vira F., 3 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/hacienda-de-las-flores-by-wedgewood-weddings)

“The Gables Wine Country Inn was the perfect venue for our wedding. It had an intimate vibe and had such a variety of beautiful atmospheric additions too such as: a charming historic barn, redwood trees, winery, and Victorian building in the backdrop, it couldn't have been better. Pam & Larry (the owners and managers of Gables Wine Country Inn) were so kind when we came to them for a last minute wedding and were so flexible and adaptable with the things we wanted for our wedding. They were extremely helpful in giving us our perfect day: the decor was gorgeous, the venue amazing, food & drink was the best and our guests had a great time too. It was a very easy planning process and they were very easy going about our wishes so I highly recommend this venue for a wedding, it was a wonderful experience and they couldn't have made the stress of planning a wedding any easier. It was a beautiful day and we have wonderful memories and photos of it forever, I couldn't be happier with it!”Holly and J., 5 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-gables-wine-country-inn)

“A family of 40 friends and relatives celebrated the life of a beloved family member who passed. Finca Montara helped find a bi-lingual non-denominational pastor, and a harpist for uplifting music. The comfortable antique pews and chairs added a lovely ambiance. Afterwards, we adjourned to the house for a buffet, toasts to the departed, and family unity. Altogether a wonderful experience! Highly recommended for weddings and renewal of vows as well as commemorations.”Barbara K., 5 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/finca-montara)

## About wedding venues in Fairfax, CA

### 

California offers an incredible 840 miles of coastline, 3,000+ wineries and ancient redwoods for your wedding day. When you choose the Golden State, you're getting exceptional natural lighting for your ceremony across diverse settings from Mediterranean coastal zones to alpine mountain backdrops. Each region has its own distinctive character that can perfectly match your vision.

### What Makes California Wedding Venues So Special?

Northern California's Napa Valley welcomes you with rolling vineyards and Spanish colonial architecture where intimate wine cave ceremonies create unforgettable moments. Head to Southern California and you'll find oceanfront venues like Duke's Malibu where you can exchange vows with the Pacific stretching out behind you while enjoying fresh coastal-inspired cuisine. Palm Springs offers dramatic desert venues with mountain backdrops and striking midcentury modern architecture that photographs beautifully.

### How Much Do Wedding Venues in California Cost?

Wedding venues in California typically run between $9,600 and $11,700 which aligns nicely with the national range of $6,500-$12,000. This represents about 18% of your total wedding budget. Your overall costs will vary based on guest count:

  * 50 guests: $26,190
  * 100 guests: $43,692
  * 150 guests: $60,141
  * 200 guests: $74,836
  * 250 guests: $89,530

Accessibility options have improved greatly across California venues in recent years.

### When Should You Book Your California Wedding Venue?

October leads venue inquiries in California with couples typically booking venues about 13 months (400 days) before their wedding date. If you're dreaming of a Northern California wine country wedding during peak season you'll want to book up to 18 months in advance. Southern California venues offer more flexibility especially during winter months when you can still enjoy beautiful weather while potentially securing better rates.
