![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We got married here in May of 2025, and I could not recommend this venue enough! This will likely be a long review, but if you are engaged and looking for a wedding venue, it is worth the read. Scribner Bend was the best option we could have chosen for our wedding, and I am so glad we did. Tldr: This venue works to save you money, has an attentive and detail oriented staff, and offers a lot to justify the price! The biggest standout was how committed the staff and team are to making sure you get the best value from your wedding. \- They cut fees without us asking (there was initially an outside vendor % fee that they changed to a flat price, or that %, whichever was lower) \- They worked with us to get what we wanted out of our wedding without additional costs (letting us substitute a red wine for sangria and a white wine for the sparkling almond without an upcharge, letting us know how to get a vegetarian option for our guests without having to pay for an additional main course, allowing us to bring in things that the venue doesn't provide at no extra cost, etc.) \- they allowed us to make changes to our headcount before making the final payment. The wedding industry is FULL of people who know they can throw in extra fees without repercussion, and Scribner bend is not like that at all. \- They honored the venue and catering price we signed under, even though we got married almost 2 years after signing. They did this without us asking. \- The venue also processed and sent the refund of our deposit by the time we got back from our honeymoon. Additionally, the staff and service overall was amazing. They remembered us by face every time we went into the tasting room, they were reachable with questions and had a wonderful response time(and I had a LOT of questions since I did not have a planner), and it was clear that they wanted to make the wedding process easy for us. Our wedding coordinator was extremely knowledgeable on everything (from venue details to the best time to call an uber back home), and she coordinated so well with Rain from Paesanos. She actually ran our wedding rehearsal better than full service planners i've seen at other weddings. The team offered well-planned options for day-of logistics, but were 100% on board with our updated vision for the day, and made it come to life at no extra cost. Scribner bend is also an easy venue to get married at. The grounds are naturally beautiful, so the only florals we bought were my bouquet to hold, and flowers for our tables. This saved us THOUSANDS of dollars. The venue is private (and the tasting rooms are closed by the time of the wedding) so you never run the risk of wedding crashers. The getting ready bungalow was HUGE. We were able to do florals and candles, have two make up artists, AND have private places to relax and get dressed without being overcrowded (and I had a huge wedding party). My husband loved the air stream as well, but I still still think the bungalow was better :). They had a good relationship with Celebrations party rentals, where my husband and I were able to customize our rentals, but still get them through Scribner Bend at a slightly lower cost (fewer fees!). I thought we were going to feel like the 11pm stop time was too early, but it actually made sure the party went until the very end, and allowed us time to say goodbye to our loved ones without feeling like we were missing any part of the evening. I would recommend Scribner bend 100 times over!”Alyssa K., 2 days ago![](https://images.zola.com/15783aa9-5ba3-4ce3-bfc8-cc75b80e159c?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/scribner-bend-vineyards)

![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“When my fiancé and I were looking for a venue for our wedding, we had a certain budget in mind that we didn't want to break and the price here was very reasonable for such a beautiful and unique venue. We also wanted a place that could hold a big wedding party in a fun town where all of the wedding party could explore before and after the event. So The Hanford Garden checked all of the boxes for us. Between the unique layout of the property and the lush greenery and flowers scattered all throughout, I pretty much knew right away it was going to be our venue when I first laid eyes upon it. We had the best time at our wedding and Sabrina (The owner) was very helpful and attentive with all of our needs before the big day, so we're very thankful for that. She even helped when one of my Groomsmen left his shoes at the venue by shipping them back to us haha All in all, its an amazing venue and the location is so nice out in Sutter Creek where you and your friends and family will have a great time during all of the festivities. Everything is within walking distance from hotels/venue/bars which is also a huge plus.”Jeremy, 6 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-hanford-garden)

## About wedding venues in Folsom, CA

### 

California offers an incredible 840 miles of coastline, 3,000+ wineries and ancient redwoods for your wedding day. When you choose the Golden State, you're getting exceptional natural lighting for your ceremony across diverse settings from Mediterranean coastal zones to alpine mountain backdrops. Each region has its own distinctive character that can perfectly match your vision.

### What Makes California Wedding Venues So Special?

Northern California's Napa Valley welcomes you with rolling vineyards and Spanish colonial architecture where intimate wine cave ceremonies create unforgettable moments. Head to Southern California and you'll find oceanfront venues like Duke's Malibu where you can exchange vows with the Pacific stretching out behind you while enjoying fresh coastal-inspired cuisine. Palm Springs offers dramatic desert venues with mountain backdrops and striking midcentury modern architecture that photographs beautifully.

### How Much Do Wedding Venues in California Cost?

Wedding venues in California typically run between $9,600 and $11,700 which aligns nicely with the national range of $6,500-$12,000. This represents about 18% of your total wedding budget. Your overall costs will vary based on guest count:

  * 50 guests: $26,190
  * 100 guests: $43,692
  * 150 guests: $60,141
  * 200 guests: $74,836
  * 250 guests: $89,530

Accessibility options have improved greatly across California venues in recent years.

### When Should You Book Your California Wedding Venue?

October leads venue inquiries in California with couples typically booking venues about 13 months (400 days) before their wedding date. If you're dreaming of a Northern California wine country wedding during peak season you'll want to book up to 18 months in advance. Southern California venues offer more flexibility especially during winter months when you can still enjoy beautiful weather while potentially securing better rates.
