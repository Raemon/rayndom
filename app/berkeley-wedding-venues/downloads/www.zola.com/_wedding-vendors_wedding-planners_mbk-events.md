Hi, I’m Morgan! Thank you so much for being here. I am the Owner and Lead Planner of MBK Events. Let’s get straight to it - I freaking love love and I love planning. I swear, celebrating love, planning events, and getting to meet new people is my specialty. While planning my own wedding, I realized that so many Brides are not enjoying the process - so, that's where I plan to step in! I officially launched my business in October of 2021 so I can help other brides execute, plan, style and enjoy the wedding planning process. It is the most magical time of your life so lets make sure it feels magical all the way to the big day!

I become friends with my clients first, their planner/coordinator second. Trust is extremely important, you're trusting me on one of the biggest days of your life! I have to get to know you both personally and professionally so I make sure your day goes as smoothly as possible!

  * ### Can't Recommend MBKE Enough!

•Verified review

•Caitie C.•Nov 21, 2025

I have a unique experience, in that Morgan was not just my wedding planner, but has been my best friend for 10 years. In addition to her being my wedding planner, she was also a bridesmaid in my wedding. I’ve always known she is incredible at what she does, but planning my wedding with her was truly the most special experience. Seeing her in action confirmed what I’ve always believed: she is exceptional. Morgan goes above and beyond in every way—she thinks of every detail and leaves nothing overlooked. Her organization, attention to detail, creativity, and dedication are unmatched. I am in awe of her and cannot recommend her highly enough. If you want someone who will make your day flawless and stress-free, Morgan is your girl.

  * ### Wedding planner of our dreams 

•Verified review

•Riley + T.•Nov 19, 2025

I don’t even know where to start, as this review could be an entire essay— to put it simply, Morgan is the best. And that is truly not an exaggeration. We scheduled our first call with Morgan before we had any plan for our wedding. There was no date, no venue, no idea of what the day would look like. The second we spoke to her, we knew we had to work with her, and that everything else would fall into place from there. She kept everything with all of our vendors organized and communicated with all of them so we didn’t have to stress about a thing. Any hiccup or challenging moment we had, she solved. She built the perfect timeline, kept everyone on track, and made the planning process feel way easier than we expected. People were constantly asking us how stressful wedding planning was, and it truly was not at all, because of Morgan. And then came the wedding day… with rain. But Morgan handled everything so beautifully. She pivoted, problem-solved, kept me calm, and made sure the day turned out 10x more beautiful than we could have imagined. Her and her team were always two steps ahead. Morgan made sure we could actually enjoy our wedding, and we did not have to manage any details that day. This was all amazing! But what I find truly so special about Morgan is all the things that I didn’t expect when working with a wedding planner. The things people don’t see… her calming me down as I cried minutes before the ceremony (because I was delusional and for some reason thought it wouldn’t rain), her reapplying my lipstick, holding my dress while I peed, putting deodorant on me midway through the night, keeping drinks in our hands, so we could spend time with our guests, making sure we actually sat down and ate, taking my extensions out when I was ready for my hair to go up, I could go on and on. During all of that she was managing every bump in the road that occurred- problems that Riley and I will never even know about because she handled them for us. And beyond all this, Morgan is truly the kindest person. We felt like we had a friend holding our hand through our entire planning process. We were sad when our monthly meetings came to an end; she was such an important part of our lives for over a year. She brings energy, fun, love, and thoughtfulness to everything she touches. We are so grateful to have met Morgan, the wedding planner, and the person.

  * ### The Darlings

•Verified review

•Ashley + I.•Nov 13, 2025

If you've started "shopping" for wedding vendors then you know it's something like a whirlwind of first dates and social media stalking. Our impressions of Morgan were positive from the start, with her standout Instagram page featuring an abundance of beautifully styled events, and a woman with a glowing smile going above and beyond for her clients. During our first meeting with Morgan, her bubbly energy and confidence left us with a gut feeling that she was the right person to guide us on this planning journey. She did not disappoint!!! Our monthly check-ins leading up to the big day were always intentional conversations, guided by encouragement, honesty and undeniable experience. That saying "you don't know what you don't know" seriously rang true. Even being a type A bride, doing research beforehand, creating my own spreadhseets, etc. I found myself appreciating, again and again, the ways that Morgan filled in the gaps. She anticipated all the things--the things we hadn't thought of--and had a solid recommendation and plan of action every step of the way. She was intentional, organized, communicative and a superstar liason in our meetings with other potential vendors too. She's the friend we didn't know we needed in the room helping us make the big decisions. The more we worked with Morgan the more grateful we were to have her on the team! Our wedding day was blissful and we have Morgan to thank for that. To put into words all of the ways she showed up for us, protected our peace and added joy to our day, would make for a super lengthy word count here. What we hope to express is that her thoughtful attention to details, take-care-of-business mindset and passion for what she does all came together to turn our dreams into reality. If you're looking for someone who will have your back 1,000%, give you their all with a baby in one hand (literally so happily giving one of our guests a break during the reception) and your lipgloss touch up in the other, and who will exceed all of your expectations, Morgan is your girl.

  * ### BEST COORDINATOR EVER!!!

•Verified review

•Ally•Oct 16, 2025

MBK Events was truly the heartbeat behind our wedding day. From the very beginning, Morgan kept us calm, confident and organized through every step of the planning process. She coordinated with our vendors flawlessly, ensured our timeline ran perfectly, and handled every little detail with so much care and precision, like it was her own wedding! On the day of the wedding, she was everywhere we needed her to be—quietly making sure everything went smoothly so we could simply be present and enjoy the moment with our friends and family. She came into the bridal suite and checked with me to make sure I was ok or if I needed anything. She made sure the groomsmen were on schedule and focused on what they needed to do. The rental company didn’t bring the right items and even forgot silverware and instead of bothering me with it or making me try to figure it out in the midst of photos, she handled it and made sure everything to delivered (That situation alone should make you want to hire her)! Through every aspect of the planning process, I knew Morgan had everything covered. She listened intently to our wishes and executed them perfectly! We are endlessly grateful for Morgan and the MBK team. Their professionalism, warmth, and genuine passion for what they do made our day unforgettable. They went above and beyond in every way, and we can’t imagine our wedding without them. If you’re looking for a planner who will treat your day with as much love and attention as you do, Morgan is the one! You will not regret hiring her!

## Frequently asked questions

3 Answers

Ask them a question

### Do you require a deposit upfront?

Yes, I do! It is a nonrefundable 25% deposit of the total contracted price due on the day you sign my contract. If the deposit is not paid within 24 hours, the contract is null and void and I am not contractually scheduled for your wedding day.

### Do you charge a travel and accommodation fee?

Yes! Hotel accommodations are required within 10-15 miles of venue in a safe location for any events located further than 40 miles from Sacramento, CA. Travel by car will be charged $0.75/mile round trip from Sacramento CA for any wedding deemed as destination (taking place beyond 40 miles).

### Do you do weddings alone or can you bring someone?

I have an assistant who works with me when I have weddings of 100 people or more. It helps the day and my own energy run high! She will be paid separately but will require a hot meal alongside of me.
