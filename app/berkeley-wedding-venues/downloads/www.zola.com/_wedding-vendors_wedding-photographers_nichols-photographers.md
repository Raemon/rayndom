We met while working at a kids summer camp in the Sierra Nevadas. Both coming from photography backgrounds, we realized that wedding photography was the perfect fit for us to be able to work together doing what we love. After marrying in Yosemite Valley, we started our business in 2006 and have since photographed hundreds of weddings together. We're an experienced team who understands the significance of capturing a once-in-a-lifetime event. Our goal is to document your wedding day story with artful intention, preserving these memories in a way that brings you back to the joy you felt on one of the most meaningful days of your life.

We're a husband and wife team with 15+ years of experience. Named a Top Photographer by Martha Stewart Weddings, our work has been featured in the wedding industry's top blogs and publications. We feel fortunate to work together doing what we love!
