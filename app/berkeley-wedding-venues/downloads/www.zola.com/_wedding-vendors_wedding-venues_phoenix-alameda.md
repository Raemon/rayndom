## About this venue

PHOENIX is a 6000 sq ft multi use art space, housing our main event space, lots of bonus spaces (gorgeous bridal room, catering space, lounge, art gallery art studios etc.) and our cozy and green outdoor patio area. Our space includes all furniture and is well styled in neutral tones, allowing you to add your own decor and style , but not requiring too much work at the same time! It is easily transformed to match your vision and we have a wide selection of in house decor rentals as well. PHOENIX is edgy, hip, artsy and modern. No dusty country club vibes, but a lively and vibrant space to dance the night away. Formal sit down weddings have ideally 50 guests or less, but we can host up to 125 guests if you are ok with a more casual 'sit where ever you'd like vibe' Our indoor / outdoor lounge and patio area allows for onsite cooking like a taco vendor, paella, BBQ or food truck. We have many great recommendations. Check our website for a virtual tour.

  * ### Best Wedding Afterparty Ever

•Verified review

•Tom and C.•Dec 17, 2024

We had our wedding at the Lake Temescal Beach house, and had to wrap up by early evening - so we needed an afterparty venue! Phoenix is right down the street and turned out to be a perfect fit. We rented their gallery space as well as the main space, which gave our guests the opportunity for some scenery change and conversation - and everyone stayed til we had to kick them out at midnight! Lighting, decor, size and shape of the space - all were totally perfect. Saskia was accommodating and eager to host us; she was enthusiastic about our plan and gave us great recommendations - how to set up the space, vendors to bring in (the taco truck was essential), and fun props and essentials for totally reasonable rental rates. We never felt pushed, upsold, or like we needed to shy away from the kind of party we wanted to have. We had a great DJ set and karaoke til midnight. Even our photographer who said he'd stay til nine was still dancing and partying when we gave everyone the boot. So fun. Highly recommend.

  * ### The Phoenix is so cute!! 

•Verified review

•Mara D.•Dec 6, 2024

I had a wonderful experience working with the team at Phoenix Alameda. Their communication style was friendly, warm, and creative, which made the planning process enjoyable. The quality of their work was excellent - the venue was artsy, clean, and offered great value for the cost. I would highly recommend Phoenix Alameda to any couple looking for a unique and memorable wedding venue.

  * ### Great Wedding/Rehearsal Venue!

•Verified review

•Natalie•Dec 6, 2024

We recently used the Phoenix as a rehearsal venue, and the experience was excellent from start to finish. The team was very helpful throughout the process, always available to answer questions and provide suggestions. On the day of the event, everything went perfectly, and our guests had an amazing time. The tables they provide are beautiful, so minimal decor was needed—an added bonus!

  * ### Great event space

•Verified review

•Clayton M.•Jul 5, 2024

I've shot several events at Phoenix. Each time the staff was very helpful, and there’s enough space to set up not only a Photo Booth for posed photos, but also tables for dinner as well as a floor for dancing. There’s also a nice little outdoor area off to the side. The real beauty of the space is that it is able to be changed to accommodate the needs of the specific event. While it's a co-working space 9-5 on weekdays, it can become whatever you need on the weekend! Big plus: it's very reasonably priced.
