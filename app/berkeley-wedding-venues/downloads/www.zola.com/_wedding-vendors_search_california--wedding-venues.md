They accommodated us and we had the ceremony outside on their property since there were no permits available for the grass area nearby. Suzy and Riley were incredible with their communication, planning and help throughout the process and we were blown away with the setup the day of the wedding...they far exceeded our expectations! The food was delicious and the whole setup turned out beautifully!. I highly recommend Malibu Farms!!!”Christina N., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/ba8c3171-bad2-4599-a6a8-039409b51836?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/malibu-farm-san-diego)

Desde el primer día que fuimos a conocer las instalaciones, el señor Gary fue muy atento y respetuoso, contestó a todas nuestras dudas. Tal vez nuestro evento fue algo fuera de lo común, a diferencia de los eventos de boda que se organizan aquí, nosotros contratamos el granero para el 25 de Diciembre para celebrar los 15 años de mi hija , sabemos que son días festivos donde la gente está con su familia , más sin embargo recibimos todo su apoyo para que el evento se hiciera realidad en este día tan especial , puedo decirles que fue una experiencia maravillosa, fue en evento de ensueño y de igual manera nos hospedamos en la casa, donde realmente nos sentimos como en nuestro hogar , sinceramente todas las instalaciones estuvieron limpias en todo momento, Gary estuvo al pendiente de si necesitábamos algo y al igual si la empresa que contratamos para la planeación necesitaban apoyo. Quiero animar a todos los papás que deseen hacerle su quinceañera a su hija, que consideren contratar los servicios de Suisun Valley Inn, ya que harán que su hija viva una experiencia única y de ensueño, no se arrepentirán. Sr Gary agradezco todas sus atenciones y muy pronto estaremos trabajando con usted para los 15 años de mi otra hija… Bendiciones”Fabiola M., 22 days ago![](https://images.zola.com/0dbc73ce-706c-4f4e-8b41-7324823426c8?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/suisun-valley-inn-at-monroe-ranch)

We knew during our tour that the Oviatt was the right venue for us. The size (for small-medium sized weddings), location, and character of the venue is really unparalleled. Then layer on top table and linen deal when you work with a preferred catering vendor and the Oviatt is the best deal in town! Gabe was very helpful during the touring and contracting phase. He communicates very clearly which made the process very smooth. There were no surprise charges at any point. The cost of everything was communicated very clearly upfront. Then, once we signed the contract, we worked with Lindsey, the director of events who supports the planning phase. Lindsey answered all of our questions in a timely and patient manner. She never hesitated to answer our questions, even when the answers to our questions were clearly outlined in the welcome packet! The event planning tools the team uses makes it incredibly easy to stay up on all of the planning details from floorplan to linen selections, to guest count - the tool handles it all with clear deadlines for each task. Finally, on the day of our wedding the Oviatt team executed the event so smoothly. Everything went off without a hitch! Our guests were so impressed by the venue. Quintessential LA rooftop vibe with art deco architecture. Such a treat. We would recommend the Oviatt to anybody looking to get married in the downtown area. The Oviatt is reasonably priced, the staff are incredibly professional and reliable, and are just nice people. We are forever grateful to the Oviatt staff for helping us have our perfect wedding!”Britney, 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/18c231fe-7151-4daa-ac54-f7fec1ea8fd1?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-oviatt-penthouse-event-deck)

Not only is it a spectacular location, but the staff is unfailingly kind, efficient, talented, and professional. I always assure my couples that their wedding will run smoothly because the onsite coordinators will have everything under control. As an officiant, I find it such a relief to know that these professionals will take charge of every aspect of the rehearsal, ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception. They are the best!”Minister M., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/06f2ccb3-99bd-4231-9b29-ac7efb56beb4?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-mountain-terrace)

From start to finish, everything was so organized and seamless. The team answered all of my questions quickly and thoroughly throughout the planning process, which really helped ease any stress. Everything was laid out and organized. You can tell they have good systems in place to ensure smooth planning. On the day of the wedding, Lauren (our coordinator) was an absolute angel. She was calm, collected, and brought such a positive, grounding energy that made a huge difference for me when I was feeling overwhelmed. She handled so many behind the scenes details that I didn’t even have to think about, and her communication throughout the process was amazing. Sierra, our banquet captain, was also incredible! She made sure the groom and I always had a drink in hand, checked in on us regularly, and went above and beyond to make sure we were enjoying every moment. And Isaac, our DJ did such a great job at accommodating our music style and requests. You can tell the whole team loves what they do. The venue itself is stunning. It's clean, beautifully maintained, and perfectly set up so that the ceremony and reception are close together. It made everything so convenient for our guests, who all raved about how beautiful the space was. We also got tons of compliments on the food from our buffet, it was delicious and a huge hit. If you’re considering this venue, I highly recommend it. We truly couldn’t have asked for a better experience or a better team to help us bring our wedding day to life.”Mika P., 6 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/44a7605c-2389-4a5c-b4aa-b40d08566f17?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/fallbrook-by-wedgewood-weddings)

It has an intimate feel, but still feels open and welcoming. The flowers were in bloom and the grass was very green. The coordination team did an amazing job accommodating all of our set-up requests and took great care of us on the day of. We are very pleased with everything and loved the preferred caterer and DJ that were part of the all-inclusive package. Overall we found this venue to be one of the more affordable options, especially given you bring in your own alcohol/drinks and can take home what’s leftover. This saved us at least 50/person. The surrounding area and city of Rancho Santa Fe are gorgeous. Parking was easy and all our guests loved the venue.”Ali D., 2 years ago![](https://images.zola.com/6b6933fc-25e6-4a90-932d-9530a7292e85?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-secret-garden-at-rancho-santa-fe)

They answered all questions I had throughout the process and were easily accessible. The Retreat was such a beautiful venue and they did such a great job. A lot of our guests said “it was the most beautiful wedding they’ve ever been to”. Super on top of it! I’m a little neurotic with planning in general and they followed instructions perfectly and even went above and beyond. Only issue - don’t get Tom as your DJ, or else you’ll be disappointed because he doesn’t do remixes or follows instructions diligently. He was good at making announcements, but as far as music goes, I would have been better off playing music off of my phone. They have a DJ that you’re required to use as part of the package because it’s in a residential neighborhood, but they do have other DJ’s aside from Tom. Otherwise everything else that WW did was fantastic.”Lauren T., 2 years ago![](https://images.zola.com/ed8e4b4f-a308-4afd-ae97-6195607551d2?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-retreat-by-wedgewood-weddings)

Not only are the grounds absolutely gorgeous, but their customer service was outstanding! Meilee set the tone as the venue coordinator, and we cannot begin to express the friendliness, professionalism, and over all care she gave us while we planned our wedding and asked her a thousand questions. She was there for us every step of the way and shared in our excitement of our wedding, she's the BEST! We would also like to give an extraordinary rating to Christopher who worked so hard all day and night of our wedding to make sure everyone had everything they needed. He was literally working nonstop and did it all with a smile. Robert at the hotel front desk was helpful and pleasant and made every accommodation he could to get us, and our guests settled into our rooms. Food, can't forget about the absolutely delicious food served at our wedding, and Enrique made sure to impress us with his coordination and talent with all of our tasty treats!

As someone who suffers from severe anxiety, I can honestly say I have never felt more at-ease and confident than while working with the Wedgewood Weddings Redwood Canyon team -- they always had our backs, kept us on track, and made us feel taken care of. From the first venue visit, during the planning meetings, all the way until the rehearsal and wedding day, the professionalism, clear communication, planning resources, and organized approach made for a seamless experience. We worked with Allison as our Wedding Planner and Coordinator and I firmly believe that she is one of the main reasons our wedding went as incredibly as it did. Redwood Canyon, provides a planning binder as soon as you sign that includes monthly checklists ahead of the wedding to help keep you organized in between planning meetings. It is also filled with valuable information about the wedding planning process, examples, vendor questions, and general guidelines. It helped us structure the planning process without losing the ability to truly personalize our event. Every meeting we had with the planning team was concise, direct, and organized -- it helped us stay on track throughout the process and gave us the opportunity to discuss ideas and ask for advice (which they are also more than happy to give via email). Super responsive and accommodating -- we were so impressed with how easy the process was. We also partnered with their recommended Bakery, DJ, and Florist as part of our vendor team, and the coordination between venue and vendors was absolutely seamless...by the time the week of the wedding rolled around all the main aspects were locked in and we knew the event was in good hands. The wedding day itself was perfect. Allison served as our Day-Of-Coordinator, and together with Jacoby (co-coordinator), Liv (banquet captain), Liz (banquet captain), and rest of the team (cooks, servers, bartenders) we had the most incredible wedding. We arrived at the agreed-upon time on the day of the wedding, and from that moment onwards, the Redwood Canyon team took over to deliver the best experience. They were organized, calm, kept us well hydrated and fed, and kept everything on track for us all night. We were able to confidently hand off the reins -- we didn't have to think of anything all day other than having a good time and enjoying our day as much as possible, trusting that all the logistics were in good hands. Overall, the venue itself was gorgeous. We had our ceremony in the Arbor Lawn, our Reception in the Grand Ballroom (we initially chose the venue primarily because of the dance floor), and rented out the Rose Room for the Cocktail Hour. Everything was included and beautifully decorated with all our desired personal touches, the food and drinks were delicious, and the planning and coordination services must be some of the best in the business. I can't imagine a more incredible experience than what we had and am so thankful for the Redwood Canyon team's care and professionalism -- especially Allison, who we were fortunate enough to work with from first meeting through the day-of. The wedding day went off without a hitch and I couldn't recommend the Redwood Canyon team more 3”Marina F., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/d5dda06b-10b8-4021-a2a3-f9a3854be326?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/redwood-canyon-by-wedgewood-weddings)

![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We held our wedding reception at Saratoga Springs in the Cathedral Grove region of the venue on a Saturday in October. After visiting them for a walkthrough, we booked this venue about a year and a few months in advance. This was the first venue we visited and we fell in love! We felt a great family-like vibe from the staff, starting with Jennifer who coordinated our initial booking and tour. Throughout our time preparing for this event, Olivia and Sam were extraordinary in their communication, response time, and knowledge of these events. They did a wonderful job in helping us understand what we needed vs. what we wanted and good decisions to make. They never tried to upsell us on more expensive options, always letting us know the best value for what we wanted. Throughout this process, we knew we had made the right choice in terms of staff. Scenically, Saratoga Springs is stunning! An outdoor venue with several different species of large trees like oaks and redwoods, many small creeks that run through and around the venue, and several amenities included such as lights that wrap around the trees, a firepit, and artificial turf that you can actually wear high heels on! We were in love with the scenery immediately because our reception was LOTR/Legend of Zelda themed and this was perfect for us. Throughout the actual event, the Saratoga Springs staff was excellent. They assisted us and our own day of wedding coordinators in running the event and making sure we had everything that they could provide. Our reception was during a brutal heat wave in the Bay Area, but Cathedral Grove had so many large trees that the shade they provided meant the floor never got hot and it felt more like 75 degrees which was SO essential for the comfort of ourselves and our guests. Everything was great, and we give the venue and their staff a 10/10. There was one glaring issue we want to address. The DJ we booked, Paul Dominguez, was a very nice man. He seemed to be on top of it, being in constant communication with us leading up to the event. We felt that he was going to do a great job. Yet, when it came time for the event, he made SEVERAL mistakes in what we asked him to do that we felt the need to address this situation and performance. He is part of the approved vendor list for DJs but we honestly feel Saratoga Springs needs to either reevaluate him or discuss this with him because literally everything else about the night was perfect for us, except him. Again, he is a nice guy and even provided cold sparklers for us for free which we really appreciated, but the lack of attention to detail in several aspects of this night was something we felt we needed to address here. Overall, Saratoga Springs is an excellent venue choice for a big event like a wedding/reception and we are happy to recommend anyone looking for a venue. We had an amazing experience for our reception and we are very satisfied with the staff and scenery of this venue.”Lillian, a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/8cb5acde-dfcf-4c0e-bc80-24ab53f619a2?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/saratoga-springs)

As the couple, we were always put first and asked throughout the day if we needed anything, which is super nice when you are busy with your guests. Our coordinator was Bre and she was so sweet and made sure that everyone (bridal party) knew what they were doing. Our DJ Kyon, was also so sweet and amazing about checking in with us on timing throughout the reception, and getting everyone on the dance floor. We really felt like we were put first. I can not recommend this place enough!! It is a beautiful venue. Everything is in one area so there are no long walks, or driving for guests. My grandfather was in a wheelchair and had an easy time getting around. I loved that I was able to text the venue at anytime so if I felt like something was amiss, it was easily handled and I would get the answers I needed, as well as the venue taking notes on requests I made.”Bailey G., 2 years ago![](https://images.zola.com/db1ca129-00cb-495c-a45c-eb8cb6c37b65?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/canopy-grove-by-wedgewood-weddings)

“I was just recently married in June of 2024 and I. Chose California Ranch Company as my wedding venue. I had visited many different wedding venues from packages, to total DIY, to garden scenery versus barn scenery, etc. It was a long process, but my husband and I decided to go with CRC during our first tour of the grounds. There a beautiful variety of nature, scenic outlooks, and character on this property and it’s paired with a comfortable farm style environment. The three most important factors for my wedding was allowing enough room for my guests to walk around without feeling restricted, a green/natural environment that photographs well, and a comfortable area where my guests can let loose and have fun. Oh and a barn. This venue checked all of my boxes out of the gate. I loved getting to see the horses and farm life on the property, many of which made an appearance in my photos. The packages were also very reasonable for someone wanting to save money with a DIY wedding but doesn’t want to start from the ground up. I had all my personal vendors chosen based on preference, but the venue was already set up to host guests. It was a perfect happy medium. I also want to make a point of noting how helpful and amazing the staff members are at CRC. It felt very warm and comfortable collaborating with the team and they went out of their way to make our jobs planning easier. Tracey was my personal coordinator and she made sure that my wedding day went through without a hitch.

The bonus was that the space came with rustic farm tables, chairs, basic lighting & string lights, bar, and pipe and drape. After looking for months - nowhere else in the city offered the value and the wow-factor that Seventh Place did. The staff was attentive, detailed, and thoughtful. Highly recommend to attended one of their open houses, or see if you can take a tour while an event is being setup, that way you can see the space in use. The staff provided sample floor plans for researching how best to use the layout effectively. Things to consider: no kitchen, but if your caterer can prep/heat elsewhere, a buffet style or cooked outside on mobile kitchen worked perfectly. The greenery/ivy is breathtaking on camera - but beware, certain times of year the ivy drips/rains droplets of sticky sap. Not an issue but be mindful of dresses/suits standing beneath it. Parking was easy, load in/out was very easy as well. The space was turn-key, with everything setup as requested when we arrived.”Evan & K., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/3e81da81-392e-4842-95ef-0bc3a1436c01?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/seventh-place)

“Bella Vista Estate Garden was the perfect venue for our wedding. From the moment we first spoke with Rima and Robert, their communication was amazing - they were always prompt to respond and so helpful in guiding us through the planning process. We didn’t know where to start with vendors and Rima was so helpful in suggesting vendors for bartending and everything else that we worked with on the wedding day. She is so organized and takes care of every detail - she took all of the stress out of the planning and her calm energy and professionalism was so greatly appreciated in planning this day. The venue itself is absolutely beautiful, with an elegant Italian villa feel that is both timeless and classic. Every detail was thoughtfully considered, and Rima and Robert were so caring and attentive that we didn't have to lift a finger on our wedding day. The end result was a dream wedding that exceeded all of our expectations. When we walked in on our wedding day I almost cried because it was more gorgeous than I could have ever imagined. It was truly everything and more to be able to celebrate such a special day in such a beautiful place. We are so grateful to Rima, Robert, and the entire Bella Vista team for creating such a special day for us.”Jennifer S., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/a5914950-ea24-49f0-a1b2-f905f5c571d8?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/norco-event-venue)

Planning a destination wedding was so seamless because of the all inclusive nature of the venue but also because of their amazing wedding producer Dayna! We had several helpful planning calls with Dayna and she was always so kind and helpful. She gave amazing directions and advice during planning and truly listened to our ideas and vision. On the day of, she and her team executed everything perfectly. I wasn’t stressed or worried on the day of because of her! Working with the provided vendors was a great experience. It was such a stress relief to know they could be trusted and worked at this venue before. We selected Flower Jubilee as our florist and Jean did an amazing job! Her arrangements and execution of our vision was spot on. Rossmoor pastries provided our delicious and beautiful cake and they worked with Dayna for the delivery and setup. Epic 1 DJ kept the party going and everyone got on the dance floor throughout the night. He also did a great job at executing the timeline and kept things running smoothly. Lastly, the catering by the Cliff restaurant was phenomenal. Andrew was so great to work with and really accommodating. During our tasting it was hard to select the meal because everything was so delicious. All of our guests raved about how beautiful and fun the wedding was and we couldn’t have asked for a better experience!”Mallory, 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/b1dbea0e-c4c2-4136-8415-fade3c214ecf?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/occasions-at-laguna-village)

Palm Springs offers dramatic desert venues with mountain backdrops and striking midcentury modern architecture that photographs beautifully.
