Located in Los Angeles, California, Alyssa Walker Photography is an accomplished wedding photography business. They specialize in numerous photographic styles to produce striking images but specialize in the candid photojournalist style. No matter the activity, photographer Alyssa Walker will highlight every moment from your walk down the aisle, to the minute you say "I do," to the fun & candid dancing shots during your celebration. Owner Alyssa Walker firmly believes that love is inclusive and no one should be denied the right to marry the one they love. Inclusivity and love are interchangeable.

Hi, my name's Alyssa. I'm a 27-year-old Fashion, Wedding + Engagement Photographer in Los Angeles. Originally from the Central Valley of California, I moved to SoCal and earned a degree in Commercial Photography. While I specialize in capturing organic candid moments, my career as a full-time fashion photographer helps me add a touch of vogue-like flair while working with my couples (I can't help myself - I want to give you some Pinterest-worthy photos!) Serving the Southern California area, I have 8+ years of weddings under my belt and look forward to capturing many more for years to come.

Alyssa Walker Photography was such a pleasure to work with! The communication was quick, and clear throughout the entire process, putting everyone at ease. The photos turned out absolutely stunning. Alyssa’s presence on the day made everything feel stress-free, and enjoyable. I would highly recommend Alyssa Walker Photography to any couple looking for an exceptional wedding photography experience.

  * ### We loved Alyssa!

•Verified review

•Reanna C.•May 19, 2023

Alyssa was an absolute joy to work with. She understood exactly what we were looking for with our photos and offered suggestions if we got a bit camera shy. Not only that but she was extremely punctual, informative, and knew exactly where she needed to be at all times. My husband and I would recommend her to anyone in SoCal who is planning on getting married, she was spectacular!
