  * ### Beautiful wedding thanks to Eventelier! 

•Verified review

•Or C.•May 16, 2025

Eventelier was an absolute pleasure to work with for our wedding! From the beginning, their communication was punctual, informative, and friendly. The quality of their work and overall value was exceptional - they were extremely flexible, understanding, and made the entire process easy. Dawn helped us brainstorm and coordinate our thoughts so that we could have our dream garden wedding exactly how we pictured it. She made the whole experience effortless and reduced my Bridezilla stress levels! Eventelier has the most high quality and stunning decor, from the big centerpieces on the tables to the finest details on the curtains. I highly recommend them for any and every type of wedding - they truly helped make our special day magical.

  * ### Exactly What I Was Looking For... and More!

•Verified review

•Tara•May 14, 2025

I searched everywhere and couldn’t find what I was looking for until I found Dawn. She immediately understood my vision, and together we created everything from scratch. The result was even better than I could have imagined. Dawn was an absolute dream to work with: talented, intuitive, and genuinely kind. I couldn’t recommend her more highly.

Response from vendor•May 15, 2025

Thanks so much for your review. It was a pleasure to create your decor for you guys! Wishing you lots of luck together.

  * ### Excellent experience

•Verified review

•Yaniv A.•May 14, 2025

I was struggling to find anything that felt truly unique for our event—everything out there looked the same. Then I found Dawn at Eventelier, and everything changed. She didn’t just offer options; she created them. We started completely from scratch, and she turned all my random ideas into something stunning and one-of-a-kind. I’d never seen anything like it before, and neither had our guests. Thank you! Our day was incredible and Dawn definitely contributed to it!

Response from vendor•May 14, 2025

Thanks so much. Loved working with you too
