![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“The team at Jefferson Street Mansion By Wedgewood Weddings was fantastic to work with throughout our entire wedding planning process. They communicated with us consistently and ensured all of our appointments were scheduled and completed as agreed. Everything about our wedding day was amazing - the food was delicious, the bar was great, and our guests raved about how fun the celebration was. The coordinator, Sophia, made sure our day went exactly according to plan and even put together a cute video for us. We also received a very personal thank you card from the venue, which made us feel so taken care of. The venue itself is absolutely beautiful, and the entire staff was incredibly sweet. We highly recommend Jefferson Street Mansion By Wedgewood Weddings for any couple looking for a stress-free, all-inclusive wedding experience.”Racquel A., 4 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/e050e7c8-f1dc-4328-baf1-e33c21d67bca?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/jefferson-street-mansion-by-wedgewood-weddings)

“(Review for catering/events/venue service) I don’t have enough great words for Nicole and her team at Berkeley City Club. I planned my wedding entirely “remotely” from out of state and Nicole was always ready to answer my millions of questions and make sure everything was being planned to perfection. I had actually never seen the hotel in person, and I must say the architecture, foliage, vibes, etc are better and MORE stunning in person than in photos. Truly a breathtaking venue that transports you with its historic arches, details, etc. Wedding food is often lackluster in my experience, but I was thoroughly impressed by all of the plated dinner dishes we were served. My salmon was perfectly cooked and guests complimented their meals as well. They were also able to accommodate all gluten free food as I have celiac disease, which was the cherry on top. Additionally, a special shout out to the staff who worked the event day-of. Everyone was kind with bright smiles, and treated me and everything/everyone else with care.”Mariana S., 3 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/berkeley-city-club)

Built in 1902 by the renowned architect Bernard Maybeck in traditional Arts and Crafts style, it's designed to create a cozy, intimate feeling. The crowning glory of the club is the three-story Great Hall. With its vaulted ceiling, massive stone fireplace, and stained-glass windows featuring heraldic crests of the great universities of the world, it's reminiscent of many a European cathedral. Light from the floor-to-ceiling windows warms the redwood paneling and suffuses the Hall in a golden glow. Two charming smaller spaces are also available for functions. The Heyns and Seaborg rooms (named respectively after a chancellor and a distinguished University Nobel Laureate) both have French doors leading to a private outdoor area with a garden view. The Faculty Club has been serving its members and guests for over 100 years and will do everything possible to make your event successful and enjoyable.Why you'll love this venue

“The Faculty Club was a pleasure to work with. They're very professional and have great insights into different setups and options. They worked with all our vendors and made sure all items we needed were provided. Setup and breakdown were also done in an efficient manner and very happy with our cocktail hour on the glade and dinner inside.”George H., 4 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-faculty-club)
