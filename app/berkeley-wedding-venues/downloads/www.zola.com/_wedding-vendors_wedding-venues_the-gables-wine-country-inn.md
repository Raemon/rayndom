  * ### Intimate & Romantic venue

•Verified review

•Holly and J.•Mar 10, 2021

The Gables Wine Country Inn was the perfect venue for our wedding. It had an intimate vibe and had such a variety of beautiful atmospheric additions too such as: a charming historic barn, redwood trees, winery, and Victorian building in the backdrop, it couldn't have been better. Pam & Larry (the owners and managers of Gables Wine Country Inn) were so kind when we came to them for a last minute wedding and were so flexible and adaptable with the things we wanted for our wedding. They were extremely helpful in giving us our perfect day: the decor was gorgeous, the venue amazing, food & drink was the best and our guests had a great time too. It was a very easy planning process and they were very easy going about our wishes so I highly recommend this venue for a wedding, it was a wonderful experience and they couldn't have made the stress of planning a wedding any easier. It was a beautiful day and we have wonderful memories and photos of it forever, I couldn't be happier with it!
