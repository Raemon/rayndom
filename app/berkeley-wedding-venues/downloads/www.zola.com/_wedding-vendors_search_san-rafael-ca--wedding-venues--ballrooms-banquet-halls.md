“Having our wedding at The San Francisco Theological Seminary was one of the easiest and best decisions we made when planning for our wedding! As soon as we stepped foot on the campus, we knew it was the venue we’d been looking for. Working with the staff here (big thank you to Jeremiah Jenkins!!) was low stress and straightforward. Many other venues we looked at just didn’t feel right and felt overly complicated. The grounds were beautifully rich with history and architecture and more than we could have asked for in a wedding venue.”Heather H., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/bb5b98cb-d8fa-4d6a-8fec-561973d2b369?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/university-of-redlands-marin-campus)

## About wedding venues in San Rafael, CA

### 

California offers an incredible 840 miles of coastline, 3,000+ wineries and ancient redwoods for your wedding day. When you choose the Golden State, you're getting exceptional natural lighting for your ceremony across diverse settings from Mediterranean coastal zones to alpine mountain backdrops. Each region has its own distinctive character that can perfectly match your vision.

### What Makes California Wedding Venues So Special?

Northern California's Napa Valley welcomes you with rolling vineyards and Spanish colonial architecture where intimate wine cave ceremonies create unforgettable moments. Head to Southern California and you'll find oceanfront venues like Duke's Malibu where you can exchange vows with the Pacific stretching out behind you while enjoying fresh coastal-inspired cuisine. Palm Springs offers dramatic desert venues with mountain backdrops and striking midcentury modern architecture that photographs beautifully.

### How Much Do Wedding Venues in California Cost?

Wedding venues in California typically run between $9,600 and $11,700 which aligns nicely with the national range of $6,500-$12,000. This represents about 18% of your total wedding budget. Your overall costs will vary based on guest count:

  * 50 guests: $26,190
  * 100 guests: $43,692
  * 150 guests: $60,141
  * 200 guests: $74,836
  * 250 guests: $89,530

Accessibility options have improved greatly across California venues in recent years.

### When Should You Book Your California Wedding Venue?

October leads venue inquiries in California with couples typically booking venues about 13 months (400 days) before their wedding date. If you're dreaming of a Northern California wine country wedding during peak season you'll want to book up to 18 months in advance. Southern California venues offer more flexibility especially during winter months when you can still enjoy beautiful weather while potentially securing better rates.
