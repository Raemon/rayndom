I had to review this place on more platforms because of how amazing it was! We truly cannot say enough amazing things about this venue and the team. The space itself is absolutely stunning—it felt magical the moment we walked in and somehow looked even more beautiful on our wedding day. The entire team was incredibly kind, attentive, and genuinely excited for us, but Kelly deserves a special shoutout. We absolutely loved her. She went above and beyond in every possible way—most memorably by framing one of our wedding photos and sending it home with us. That alone shows how much she truly cares. The food was incredible, and our guests are still talking about it. We were having so much fun dancing that we didn’t even finish our cake, and the team thoughtfully saved it for us, which meant so much at the end of the night. The pricing was also very budget friendly, and they truly work with you to make your vision happen within what you can afford, which made the planning process so much less stressful. Everyone is still telling us how beautiful and fun our wedding was, and it honestly means the world to us. Knowing that our guests felt the love, joy, and magic of the day makes our hearts so full. None of it would have been possible without this incredible team and Kelly, who put so much care into every detail. We will always be grateful for everything they did to make our wedding day unforgettable, and we cannot recommend this venue enough.”Linda H., 25 days ago![](https://images.zola.com/f17bb0aa-5396-44e7-bf78-029edea110f4?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/eagle-ridge-by-wedgewood-weddings)

### How Much Do Wedding Venues in Sunnyvale Typically Cost?

Wedding venues in Sunnyvale average $11,198 for a 150-guest celebration which takes up about 18% of your total budget. This pricing aligns nicely with what couples pay nationwide at $6,500 to $12,000.

The Griffith House features those gorgeous Spanish-style grounds with wheelchair-accessible pathways winding through garden settings ideal for outdoor ceremonies everyone can enjoy.

Treehouse Hotel Silicon Valley provides modern tech amenities that make hybrid events possible with their coordination and audiovisual services letting distant guests feel included. You'll find The Domain Hotel hosts lifecycle celebrations with facilities that partner with external AV providers to enhance remote guest experiences. While most venues in Sunnyvale offer Wi-Fi and basic streaming capabilities for simple broadcasts, creating truly interactive experiences where remote guests can participate meaningfully typically requires bringing in specialized AV and virtual event services to supplement what's available.

### What Booking Timeline Should Couples Follow?

Booking your dream venue in Sunnyvale requires planning ahead since most spaces need to be secured about 14 months (420 days) before your wedding date. November sees the highest number of venue inquiries so you might want to avoid that peak timing. This extended timeline reflects just how competitive the wedding market is especially when you're looking at popular venues or trying to secure prime weekend dates. Starting your venue search early gives you the best chance at landing your top choice.

Bar services typically run around $7,166 (11%) while photography requires about $5,001 (8%). Wedding planners average $5,076 (8%) and videography comes in at $4,523 (7%). Entertainment like bands or DJs costs around $1,785 (3%) while cakes and desserts take a smaller $858 (1%). Hair and makeup services round out the essentials at approximately $630 (1%) of your total budget.
