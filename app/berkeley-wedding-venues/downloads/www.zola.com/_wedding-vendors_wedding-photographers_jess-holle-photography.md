I'm Jess, a wedding and portrait photographer based in Sacramento, CA. I know the wedding planning process can be quite overwhelming, and that's why I'm here to help you at every step leading up to your special day. I take pride in making a comfortable environment while I take photos, so people can feel like their most confident, beautiful selves. I get the most satisfaction when couples see their photos for the first time and are amazed at how stunning they look. I love showcasing what I see through my lens and giving people the confidence they didn’t know they had!

Couples often describe their experience working with me as fun, easy, and memorable. Playing music, creating games, and guiding my couples with engaging poses are all things I do to set the atmosphere. I want you to walk away from our session feeling empowered and like you just made a friend. I’m here waiting for you to join me on my next adventure! I’ll grab my camera, and you show me your favorite place. I am so looking forward to getting to know you two more and hearing everything that you’re dreaming up for your big day! I encourage all couples to fill out my contact form on my website.

  * ### Highly Recommend Working with Jess!

•Verified review

•Bianca•Jul 7, 2025

Jess was so great to work with because she is easygoing and super sweet. She has a great eye for detail and can walk into any space and pick out the best spot for pictures. We used her for both our engagement photos as well as our wedding photos and are super happy with the results. She doesn't rush anything and also made us both feel comfortable in front of the camera. I highly recommend using her for her services and will definitely reach out in the future if we ever need professional photos! Thank you, Jess!

  * ### If you don't book Jess you are missing out!

•Verified review

•Kristin W.•Oct 28, 2024

Jess is AMAZING! Both my partner and I are not photogenic specifically with posing. Jess guided us through how to stand, where to look, and what to do with our hands so that we looked natural. She even has some silly questions to ask each other to make sure the laughing is natural in the photos. We got our preview for our wedding with 100 photos in six days! Thats right six days!! Our guest loved her as well and have complimented how great she was during the day. Not only was she our photographer, but she was also a cheerleader, bride helper, timeline planner and so much more. Jess thank you for everything, we can't wait to work with you again in the future!

  * ### Amazing Photographer! 

•Verified review

•Elissa Dunn•Oct 15, 2023

I have had the opportunity to work with Jess for a few events now, and each time it has been an absolute pleasure! Jess is so personable, easy to work/ communicate with, professional and extremely talented! Being a floral designer, so much time, energy, labor and love is put into the floral designs. Viewing the galleries from Jess for these events have made me so so happy! Jess has such a good eye, and the amount of detail she captures is truly amazing. It's hard to choose just a few photos since they literally are all so perfect! If you're in need of a photographer for your event, Jess is your girl!

•Natalie & J.•Oct 12, 2023

Jess was great to work with for our wedding! She was super clear and communicative and very supportive of our wishes for photography on our big day. She was realistic about our timeline and helpful in planning our order of events so that we could fit it all in. The photos came out SO GOOD! We had a pretty gray day out on the coast and, despite that, she managed to make it look just as lovely and magical as it felt! I can't recommend Jess enough. Super easy going, super talented photographer!

## Frequently asked questions

4 Answers

Ask them a question

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically, couples book me 1 year before their wedding date. I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible about my availability, even if you’re planning on a shorter time frame.

### How do you describe your photography style?

I like to describe my style as candid and authentic. I'm not the photographer that will have you stand there and smile at my camera. Instead, I utilize movement to tell a story and capture those genuine, authentic moments. Clients often come to me for my warm, earthy-style photos. My photos tend to be vivid, dreamy, and natural while also being bright but contrasted.

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

I spend a lot of time obsessing over your photos and making sure they’re perfect! I'll deliver the final gallery 6-8 weeks from the wedding. I'll send sneak peek photos I week after, so you have something to look at and share while I work on the rest!

### How many pictures will we receive?

You can expect about 80-120 images per hour of photography.
