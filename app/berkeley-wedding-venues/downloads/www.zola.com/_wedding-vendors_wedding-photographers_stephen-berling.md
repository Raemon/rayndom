HI, I’M STEPHEN——-A creative soul with a love for romance. I have always been creatively minded and had a deep love for true connection between humans, the unabashed real type of connection. I believe, at the end of the day, these true moments, even the smallest ones, are what mean the most. Weddings are filled with these tiny moments and the fact that I get to capture them, stop time and hand them onto you to be remembered forever means more than you may ever

I first fell in love with photography at an early age while diving into boxes searching for photos of my late father. I realized that a single photo contains so much. It preserves a moment when it has been long extinguished. A single photo can transcend you back in time making the memories almost tangible. For us, connection comes first. It's one of our main inspirations in this journey we're on and we absolutely love connecting with others who share the same outlook on life. We have fallen in love with documenting the love of our couples in real time.

Stephen and Morgan are the absolute most amazing people to work with. They did an incredible job and we couldn’t have asked for anything better. They captured our wedding perfectly and I highly recommend them for any photos you will ever need taken! We love them and so will you!
