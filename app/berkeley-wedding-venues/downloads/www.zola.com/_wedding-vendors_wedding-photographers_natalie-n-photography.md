  * ### Natalie is amazing! Highly recommend!

•Verified review

•Donna and J.•Aug 22, 2020

Natalie was so sweet and easy to work with - not to mention she loves dogs, and our nervous pooch fell in love with her. Natalie is really organized and helped us finalize a timeline which made our day smooth. She fixed boutonnieres, managed our massive family photo, and even drove my husband and I from our ceremony to the reception. Having our engagement session with her also prepped us a little for what to expect. She gave us direction, and made us feel more at ease. Our ceremony was at Old Mill Park, and our couple photos in the redwoods were dreamy. She has a great eye, and the photos really were magical and timeless, with just the right amount of moodiness. She brought along a 2nd photographer, and they both caught really fun candid moments of our family and friends. She also had our photos back to us so quickly. Natalie was just super thoughtful, warm, and flexible. I can't recommend her enough. Thank you, thank you, Natalie! <3

  * ### Amazing Wedding Photographer - Highly Recommend

•Verified review

•Andrea and W.•Aug 4, 2020

Natalie was an impressive wedding photographer. She had a lot of great ideas for engagement and first look locations. And when it rained on our wedding day, she was out scouting impromptu first look locations in the rain before our ceremony. We are very pleased with the final product, which included a wide array of shots. She even touched up a few photos after, per our request. Natalie is easy to work with, flexible, and fun! You should book her now!!

  * ### Absolutely recommend!!

•Verified review

•Emily Dreblow Rey•Jul 29, 2020

I've had the pleasure of working with Natalie for many years including my engagement party, team head shots and many work related projects. I love her ability to capture both the details and the emotion/connection of the moment. She's very gifted in bringing ease and authenticity to any setting to to evoke our natural way of being in her images. She's a very talented elopement wedding photographer with great versatility to also excel in corporate/commercial settings.
