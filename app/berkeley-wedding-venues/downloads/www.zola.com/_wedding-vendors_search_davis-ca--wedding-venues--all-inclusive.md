Everything went so smoothly from start to finish, which allowed us to fully enjoy every moment without stress. The venue itself is absolutely stunning, pictures don’t even do it justice. Our guests couldn’t stop complimenting how beautiful the estate was, and the food was excellent, exceeding all expectations. I honestly could not have planned a better day or a more seamlessly organized event. Wedgewood made the entire planning process so easy and stress-free. Our coordinator, and the entire day-of staff were wonderful, professional, kind, attentive, and truly on top of everything. I couldn’t have imagined a better wedding day, and I’m so grateful to the Winchester Estate and Wedgewood team for making it so perfect. Highly recommend to any couple looking for a beautiful venue and an effortless planning experience.”Jennifer M., 11 days ago![](https://images.zola.com/b3f2b268-2ea2-4f63-9215-88c4fa407884?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/winchester-estate-by-wedgewood-weddings)
