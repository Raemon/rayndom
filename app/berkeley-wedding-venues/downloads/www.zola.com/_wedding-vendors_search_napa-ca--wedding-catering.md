Toasted 5.0 Napa, CA

  * Starts at $85 

Noticing a distinct lack of authentic bagels in the Napa Valley, Toasted was created at the end of 2016 by Ariella Wolkowicz. Hoping to fill the bagel void in Napa, we offer a variety of gourmet bagels and cream cheeses. At Toasted, we focus on making high-quality bagels that people really enjoy. We believe that every bite of our delicious bagels can make you happy. Come join us and experience the joy of a well-made bagel.“Toasted catered and set up my daughter's bat mitzvah lunch, and Ariella and her team were perfect! Of course we knew the food would be fantastic, we love her bagels. She really worked we me to figure out how much food we would need- it was all a guess! And we had some left overs but not a lot. She was fantastic to work with and would 10/10 recommend Toasted.”Karen, 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/94c04be6-d769-4f4f-8024-db43f86e959d?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-catering/toasted--3)

Preferred Sonoma Caterers 5.0

  * Starts at $5,000 
  * Serves Napa, CA

Hi, Zola is not our platform; please contact us directly by searching for our website. Thanks! Preferred Sonoma Caterers was founded by Owner/Chef Amber Balshaw and her husband Jim over 25 years ago. Amber’s love of cooking always keeps her excited about food, and that excitement keeps her menus fresh and innovative. Amber has seen trends in food and design come and go (and sometimes come again) over her years planning weddings and other events. She loves to help couples brainstorm new ideas and knows how an event should flow to get everything just right.“We booked with PSC because when we did our tasting we talked to Amber. She told us that she knew the farmers who were growing the vegetables that they were using in their dishes. The food was great with several options. They were easy to work with when it came to the specifics I wanted. The food was even better at the wedding than I remembered at the tasting. The garnishes and details were beautiful and elegant. All my guest commented on how good the food was. Thank you PSC staff for everything!”Jeanne H., 3 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-catering/preferred-sonoma-caterers)

Sally Tomatoes 5.0

  * Serves Napa, CA

Gerard and Bill, had already been working together in the restaurant industry for more than 15 years when they decided to go into business together. They wanted to create a restaurant with all the best attributes of their previous experiences, one where they could focus on making a difference to people in their biggest life moments and a stronger focus on community service and philanthropy. In 2007 they moved in to the green community of SOMO Village, taking over the enormous kitchen to support catering orders and then seizing an opportunity to use the adjoining space for a restaurant.“This was the perfect wedding venue for us!! They helped take so much stress off of the day and made me feel so comfortable going into my wedding day. They answered every question I had, no matter how small & minor it was. The day of went so smoothly because they helped with so much! They set everything and catered it with such good food. I’ve recommended them to almost everybody who needs an event space for any type of event.”Harley T., 7 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/2e14be40-ec2a-401f-934e-b6514cb5dea9?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-catering/sally-tomatoes)

El Coqui Puerto Rican Cuisine 5.0

  * Serves Napa, CA

El Coqui has been bringing the flavors of Puerto Rico to Sonoma County Since 2009. Jackie was born in the Bronx and raised in Queens NY by her Grandmother who would take her back to Puerto Rico every summer. El Coqui has been recognized by the Press Democrat and the North Bay Bohemian as "Best Latin Restaurant" in Sonoma County year after year. We were featured on Food Network, Check Please Bay Area and won the Gold Medal at the Sonoma County Harvest Fair.“El Coqui catered our wedding and Jackie and Tina were beyond professional and helpful through every step of the way, from the tasting up to the big day. I sincerely appreciated how much they went above and beyond the call of duty with their kindness. The food was amazing, we received lots of "best food at a wedding ever" compliments, and as a bonus, we had a lot of wonderful leftovers for the rest of the week. I can't recommend the restaurant and the food enough - be sure to consider them for your next wedding if you really want to impress your family, friends and guests.”Stephen and R., 3 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-catering/el-coqui-puerto-rican-cuisine)

YOOSHI SUSHI CATERING & EVENT PRODUCTION 5.0

  * Serves Napa, CA

I had my first shot at managing a sushi restaurant when I took over an empty section of the family restaurant and introduced sushi to my customers. It was a challenge that I will never regret accepting. It was fun, a lot of fun! I had the opportunity to work with some really talented and creative chefs. I quickly learned that it’s not just about having fresh fish anymore. Sushi dining has transformed into a culture. A culture built by imagination and creativity. With the help of GD and the support of my family, I took all that experience and fused it with my imagination and created Yooshi Sushi Catering and Event Production.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Yooshi Sushi were a great choice for a sushi bar for our wedding. The display was stunning and we received compliments about how good the sushi was throughout the night and weeks following the wedding. It's been 3 weeks and we still have guests talking about how good the food was. The price breakdown on their website makes planning easy and the owner, Farzad was very kind and made the process easy. Big plus that they are certified Kosher, which took care of providing food for our Kosher observant guests. Highly recommend, you will not be disappointed.”Michelle I., 7 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-catering/yooshi-sushi-catering-event-production)

From the very beginning, their communication was seamless and professional. They listened carefully to all my needs and provided thoughtful suggestions that made the entire process stress-free. The team at Glad Mouf truly went above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect for my special day. The food was absolutely incredible! The oxtail was tender and flavorful, cooked to perfection with a rich, savory sauce that had just the right amount of seasoning. Every bite was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The crab fried rice was another standout—packed with juicy crab meat and a delicious combination of flavors. It was the perfect balance of savory and just the right amount of richness. I’ve had many versions of crab fried rice, but this one was top-tier. As for the overall experience, the quality and value of their work were exceptional. The portions were generous, and the food was served fresh and hot, even though they were catering to a large crowd. Our guests couldn't stop talking about how amazing the food was. Glad Mouf’s dedication to their craft really shone through, and they contributed to making my wedding day even more memorable. If you’re looking for top-notch BBQ and seafood, I highly recommend Glad Mouf. They will elevate any event with their great food and excellent service!”Sakinah P., a year ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-catering/glad-mouf)

It’s our way of continuing the tradition of Mexican hospitality; full of love, generosity, and connection.“We hired Sabores Komali to cater my mom’s 60th birthday party and couldn’t be happier with the experience. From the start, they were incredibly easy to communicate and organize with, super professional and responsive. The food was so good! We had a mix of small bites and a taco bar. The shrimp ceviche, empanadas, and esquites were all huge hits with our guests. My whole family couldn’t stop talking about how delicious everything was. The taco bar was also delicious, with a variety of toppings and satisfying protein options that really made the meal feel curated to our taste.
