“We hosted our October 2023 Wedding Reception at The Tech Interactive and I highly recommend it to anybody who is looking for a unique (and literally interactive) venue. It was so much fun and our guests had a great time! We rented the entire lower level and they kept the galleries and exhibits open so our guests could play with them throughout the night! They were a hit during cocktail hour as well as for taking breaks from the dance floor (although we still always had plenty of people on the dance floor!) Our event was mostly adults with a handful of younger relatives, and everyone had a great time. The exhibits at The Tech Interactive are perfect for quick and fun interactions no matter how interested (or not interested) any individual guest was in science/technology. Our engineer friends had a great time with the Cyber Detectives activities, while even our least technically-inclined guests enjoyed playing around with things like the Jet Pack Chair and Solve For Earth. This was truly best of both worlds, as we didn't have to give up any of the "traditional" wedding elements to make room for the fun of the exhibits - our tables and decorations were set up beautifully, we still had appetizers and an open bar, and like I mentioned above, there were still always plenty of people on the dance floor! We actually didn't even need to decorate as much as we might have with a more "traditional" venue either, as the existing colors, lighting, and layout of The Tech make for a strong baseline to build from. Our primary contact was Lolita and she was extremely helpful and pleasant to work with. She was there with us every step of the way, from our initial tour to our reception itself. She made sure to consider exactly what we were looking for to make our wedding special and was extremely organized and great and communicating with us as well as our other vendors. She created a great layout based on our table count, dance floor size, and the space the caterer needed, and she and her team went above and beyond and worked with our caterer and coordinator to help set everything up between the public close time and the start of our event so that everything was perfect when our guests got there. They even let us customize the exterior lighting color of the building during our event. The physical location of The Tech Interactive is fantastic as well - right in downtown San Jose within walking distance of tons of hotels and two parking garages where The Tech validates. The city closed off Market Street right in front of The Tech relatively last minute for a public city event, but Lolita was on top of it and worked with us and our shuttle company to arrange for pickup and a smooth experience for our guests. In summary: If you're looking to do something unique with your wedding or event, I can't recommend The Tech Interactive enough. Lolita was fantastic to work with and our guests couldn't stop saying how it was one of the most fun weddings they had ever been to.”Steve W., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-tech-interactive)

“As a vendor, we love working at Club Auto Sport. Its unique theme and combination of indoor space and large outdoor patio make it easy to create different vignettes, especially when there is a cocktail hour that needs its own space. The venue is home to a collection of classic exotic cars and tons of racing memorabilia, lovingly displayed. The owners take such good care of the venue, and strive to provide a great experience from start to finish. Club Auto Sport is truly a great partner!”Tony Caters, 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/club-auto-sport)
