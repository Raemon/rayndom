•Verified review

•Martha•Apr 29, 2025

From the moment we first reached out to Polizzi Studios, their communication was amazing, professional, and fun. They were extremely responsive and helpful in planning all the photography details for our wedding day. On the day of, the team from Polizzi Studios was incredibly precise with all the poses, ensuring we got beautiful, natural-looking shots. The final edited photos were delivered on time and the quality was truly amazing - they captured all the special moments of our day perfectly. We could not be happier with the value and quality of service provided by Polizzi Studios, and we highly recommend them to any couple planning their wedding.
