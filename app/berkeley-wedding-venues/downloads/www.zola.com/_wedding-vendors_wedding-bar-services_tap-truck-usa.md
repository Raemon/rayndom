Tap Truck USA was an excellent choice for our wedding bar services and beverages. From our first interaction, their communication was clear, informative, and they were incredibly easy to talk to, making the planning process a breeze. On the day of, the quality of their work was top-notch - their attention to detail was impressive, and they moved quickly to ensure our guests were taken care of. The bartender was particularly noteworthy, making sure to save two special drinks for my husband and I at the end of the night. He had a fun, relaxed demeanor that was a perfect fit for our wedding celebration. We couldn't have asked for a better bar service provider to help make our special day so memorable.
