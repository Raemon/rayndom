Hello Brides! 💍✨ My name is Mandi, the artist behind the brush at MakeupbyMandiP I’m a local makeup artist based in Nevada County and I travel all throughout Northern California. I’m a licensed cosmetologist with over 15 years of experience specializing in wedding and special event makeup. I’m all about soft, natural glam and most importantly, helping my brides feel like the most beautiful, confident versions of themselves on their big day. I truly love what I do and feel so honored every time I get to be part of such a special moment. I can’t wait to connect with you and be part of your wedding journey 🤍✨“Mandi is the best!! I’ve used her throughout the years for important events & we have become friends through it all… actually literally within the first 5 minutes of when I met her! She is the most beautiful person inside and out! At my wedding, we had a wide range of young girls to women, 7 in total, and she had the perfect look for each one of them!! I’ve had so many people reach out to her after she saw the bridesmaids and mom’s makeup, from 20 years old to 55! My wedding went so smoothly and so much of it was because of her. I’ve never felt more beautiful than that day. When you’re booking with Mandi, you’re getting more than a makeup artist! 11/10!!!”Mady, 16 days ago![](https://images.zola.com/6363a402-f8be-461f-9bed-de52422cbb64?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/makeup-by-mandi-p)

Hi, I’m Maddie, a Northern California makeup artist specializing in timeless, natural glam for brides who want to look and feel like themselves on their wedding day — just a little more elevated ✨ My goal is to bring that vibe while creating a look that lasts all day (and night!) and photographs beautifully. Every bride has her own version of “glam,” and I love bringing that vision to life in a way that feels effortless and true to you. Whether it’s your big day or a special event, I’m here to help you feel confident, radiant, and ready for every unforgettable moment. 🤍![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Maddie worked with me leading up to my wedding and helped me find my lash extension style as well as makeup trial. I don’t have a lot of experience with makeup so I showed her pictures I liked on other people and she recreated the looks so well! On my wedding day, she showed up on time, did multiple of my bridesmaids makeup, brought all the good vibes, and did my makeup flawlessly. She listened to the feedback I had after my trial to create my ideal bridal makeup and I couldn’t be happier with the finished look. If you’re thinking about booking Maddie for your professional makeup, then this is your sign! She made the getting ready process easy and stress free.

The face beater- Tanya 5.0

  * Team of 3
  * Starts at $1,400 
  * Serves Davis, CA

I fell in love with makeup in 2013, and have since then made moves to elevate and educate myself in this industry. I have beat hundreds of faces over the years, and have gained skills and practices to keep up with trends. I would love to service you in your upcoming special occasion, so please, send me a message!“Tanya was an absolute dream to work with for my wedding day beauty needs, and I honestly don’t know what I would have done without her. From the very first interaction, she made me feel comfortable and cared for. She was open to feedback, quick to respond to all of my questions, and always made me feel like my concerns truly mattered. That kind of attentiveness is rare, and it immediately gave me confidence that I was in the best hands. Her work was nothing short of fantastic. The quality of her artistry was top-tier, especially considering her very reasonable price point. But what really stood out was the way Tanya went above and beyond. She surprised us by doing my grandmother’s makeup at no additional charge, even though it wasn’t part of the original plan. That small act of kindness meant so much to me and my family. My grandmother can be a bit particular, and many people struggle to work with her, but Tanya approached her with patience, gentleness, and genuine warmth. The result was stunning—my grandmother looked radiant and felt so special, which added another layer of joy to the day. On a personal level, Tanya made me feel beautiful in a way I hadn’t expected. As a plus-sized bride, I had some initial worries about how I would look and whether I’d feel confident in front of everyone. Tanya instantly put those fears to rest. Her sweet and funny personality made me feel at ease. By the time she finished, I felt not only gorgeous but also completely myself—comfortable, happy, and ready to shine. She didn’t just connect with me, either. Tanya got along wonderfully with the entire wedding party, bringing laughter and lightness to what could have been a stressful morning. She created such a positive, fun atmosphere that set the tone for the rest of the day. Her talent, professionalism, kindness, and heart made all the difference. I cannot recommend her highly enough—if you’re looking for someone who will not only make you look beautiful but also make you feel beautiful, Tanya is the one.”Victoria D., 2 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/4aa14213-24a3-4cea-8fa4-00c3f16e777a?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-hair-makeup/the-face-beater-tanya)

I absolutely love getting to be a part of such a big day for so many amazing couples!

This has been my calling and my passion for as long as I remember. But really the best part is getting to meet so many amazing women and helping them create memories that will last a lifetime.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Lauren was amazing!
