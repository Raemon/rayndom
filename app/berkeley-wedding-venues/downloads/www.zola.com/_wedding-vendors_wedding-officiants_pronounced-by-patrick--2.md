Hello there! I'm Patrick, a professional wedding officiant based in Paso Robles, California...Our little drinking town, with a farming problem...but I do travel! I take absolute delight in helping make your wedding ceremony just as you envisioned it. After all, it's your special day! In addition to working as an officiant, I'm also the owner of a distillery in Paso Robles, a voice-over specialist, and I have a multiple-subject teaching credential. That's right, the booze making officiant!

As someone deeply passionate about love and commitment, I've been fortunate to stand alongside countless couples as they embark on one of the most remarkable journeys of their lives - marriage. What sets me apart is my unwavering commitment to creating ceremonies that are uniquely tailored to each couple. I work closely with you to design an experience that perfectly reflects your love story and shared values. I take pride in my belief that love knows no boundaries.

**In three words:** Collaborative, Fun, Positive

  * ### 5/5 Experience with Patrick

•Verified review

•Preston P.•Jun 22, 2025

Patrick absolutely deserves the 5/5 stars - he did an absolutely incredible job officiating our wedding! We recommend him to anyone who is looking for someone who can command a crowd well (not always common in officiants) and bring a dash of humor to the ceremony while saying on-tone The feedback from our guests about the ceremony & Patrick's role in it was resoundingly positive As an added bonus, Patrick himself is an incredibly funny and genuine person, and I'm happy to have gotten to know him through the process Thank you again Patrick for doing an outstanding job Preston & Caroline

Response from vendor•Jun 22, 2025

I absolutely loved walking down the aisle with Caroline and Preston! You two rocked my world from the moment you walked into my distillery. It makes officiating a wedding so much fun when we hit it off the way we did, it's genuinely special. Not to mention, getting to be at the best wedding venue on the central coast! The love in the air that day was unmatched. You're an amazing couple, and you had a spectacular group of people supporting you on your big day. The reason your wedding was flawless is because of the intention and emotion you put into this life on a daily basis. It was genuinely splendid meeting you both, and I can't wait for our next reunion! Cheers!

  * ### Our Favorite Wedding Vendor! 

•Verified review

•Hannah F.•Apr 14, 2025

Patrick is an amazing wedding officant. We had no idea we would be making a lifelong friend when we hired him as our wedding officant after finding him online. He will start your wedding off on a high note with his lovely speech he gives. We recieved lots of compliments on our ceremony thanks to him. He has broad experience in public speaking and is a very charismatic man. Cheers to Patrick! Thanks for making our wedding the perfect day.

Response from vendor•Apr 14, 2025

You two mean so much to me. I love that we met and became buddies. Your vows literally made me cry, like everyone else in the crowd! I love officiating weddings because I get to work with people like you. Thank you for making my gig beautiful, loving, and a good time! You’re my pals forever.

Patrick did a wonderful job at our wedding. He talked us through all the steps leading up to it, helped my husband coordinate a sweet surprise and had the perfect energy to engage our guests and help tell our story. I highly recommend Patrick!

Response from vendor•Apr 11, 2025

Katie! You rock my world! I loved being a part of your special day. That was a beautiful ceremony in a beautiful place! One to remember. Next time you’re in Paso Robles, the libations at my distillery are on me! Thank you!

  * ### He’s the man 

•Verified review

•Baylee and C.•Apr 10, 2025

Patrick is amazing! He made everything so enjoyable and easy. He definitely kept things fun but still professional, both in first meeting him and on the day of the ceremony/during the ceremony. It was all super detailed to us as a couple. He's a really good dude inside and out. Very respectful too. We love this guy!

Response from vendor•Apr 11, 2025

Baylee and Christian rock my world! I loved being a part of your special day! You’re so much fun, and what an amazing venue for a beautiful day. Don’t be strangers at my little booze factory! ❤️
