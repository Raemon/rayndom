We began as a concession company providing cotton candy at sporting events. In the fall of 2021, we extended our brand by starting our own manufacturing plant. Sweet Buckets was born as an option for customers and businesses to purchase Cotton Candy and Gourmet popcorns direct from our company.

We not only deliver a high-quality product, but deliver a memorable experience with a custom label tailored to match any wedding theme! Close your eyes and transport yourself back to those carefree days when that sweet, warm, toasted smell of kettle corn surrounded your sense. The utter delight you felt at the sight of that colorful cloud that dissolved as soon as it touched your tongue. A smile creeps across your face and memories flood in. You grab a fist-full of that buttery goodness and pop some kernels into your mouth. Let us help you create new memories while remembering the old along side friends and family!

  * ### Yum Yum, So Good!

•Verified review

•Jen M.•Oct 4, 2024

Treats are amazing and delicious. I over-ordered for my wedding and Leshia was sweet to help me correct the numbers and get everything shipped to me timely. She was instrumental in getting a custom label made to go on our cotton candy and popcorn containers. Thank you for everything!

  * ### A Raving Success

•Verified review

•Shaye W.•Oct 3, 2024

Sweet Buckets was an amazing choice for our wedding desserts. Their communication throughout the planning process was effective, polite, and quick. The quality of their work was perfect - the flavors of popcorn we chose were yummy, unique, and absolutely delightful. Our guests raved about it even weeks later, which was a fun nod to how my husband and I first met. We couldn't have asked for a better vendor to help make our special day even sweeter!

  * ### The popcorn was a HIT!

•Verified review

•Lyndsey C.•May 26, 2024

We had our wedding reception at a brewery and wanted some easy to eat sweet and salty snacks. These popcorn flavors were delicious, they sent us flavors to try before we decided. We chose 4 flavors and they shipped them right to our house. The popcorn buckets had our cute custom labels which they designed for us and looked PERFECT! We had tons of compliments on the popcorn. We ordered plenty and people were grabbing them to take home at the end of the night. A perfect snack after a few beers. Theu were very fast with the samples and the order too!
