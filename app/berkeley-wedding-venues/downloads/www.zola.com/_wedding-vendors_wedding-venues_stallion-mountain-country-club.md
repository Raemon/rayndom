  * ### Stallion Mountain Magic

•Verified review

•Cecily W.•Dec 21, 2025

The team at Stallion Mountain by Wedgewood Weddings made our wedding planning experience everything we hoped it would be. From our first interactions with our planning coordinators to the attentive banquet staff, every team member was friendly, professional, and efficient. The venue's modern interior and scenic mountain backdrop immediately caught our attention, and we were thrilled with its quality and affordability. We were impressed with the all-inclusive style as the florist, photographer, and other recommended vendors seamlessly worked together to bring our vision to life. We wouldn't have changed a thing about our wedding day, thanks to the magic makers at Stallion Mountain!

  * ### September Wedding

•Verified review

•Mae•Dec 15, 2025

Our wedding at Wedgewood Weddings Las Vegas on September 29, 2025, was truly everything we dreamed of and more. From the very beginning, the entire team made us feel supported, understood, and genuinely cared for. One person who deserves the biggest spotlight is Maci, our end-of-day wedding coordinator. She was nothing but helpful, hands-on, and incredibly attentive. From rehearsal day to the wedding day, she made sure we were calm, informed, and fully supported. I never once felt lost or stressed because Maci was always two steps ahead, anticipating our needs and taking care of every detail. We also want to recognize our Sales & Planning Team, Maci, Codie, Bianca, and Cristina, who guided us throughout the entire planning process. They were always patient, responsive, and organized, and they made wedding planning feel so much easier. Every question, every update, every concern, they handled it with professionalism and kindness. On the wedding day, we were blessed with an amazing team! Rachel, the Banquet Captain stayed by my side minutes before I walked down the aisle until the very last minute of the night. Her presence was calming, supportive, and reassuring. She made sure we were taken care of every moment. Constantine, our Bartender not only did he keep the drinks flowing, but he was also hilarious and kept the energy fun all night. Ann from ACS Florals brought our floral vision to life beautifully. Every arrangement was stunning. Our DJ, Ulisses kept the vibe alive, read the room perfectly, and made the dance floor so much fun. Overall, Wedgewood Weddings Las Vegas delivered an unforgettable experience. The staff was organized, kind, and truly dedicated to making our day perfect. We walked away with the most precious memories thanks to an amazing team who genuinely cared. We couldn’t have asked for a better wedding day.

  * ### A Perfect Wedding

•Verified review

•Allison C.•Dec 6, 2025

Our wedding at Stallion Mountain by Wedgewood was truly everything we dreamed of and more, and that’s thanks to the incredible team who supported us every step of the way. From the very beginning, the Sales and Planning Team: Cristina, Bianca, and Codie made the entire process feel effortless. They were responsive, knowledgeable, and genuinely invested in bringing our vision to life. Every detail was thoughtfully planned, and their guidance kept us organized and stress-free. On the big day, Cristina, our day of coordinator, was an absolute superstar. She handled everything with calm confidence, kept the timeline running smoothly, and made sure we felt taken care of from start to finish. We can’t imagine the day without her. A huge thank you to Rachel, our amazing banquet captain, who ensured the reception ran flawlessly. Her professionalism and warm energy were felt throughout the night. The banquet staff: Nataly, Jenniffer, and Carlos were outstanding. They were attentive, friendly, and made our guests feel welcome and well cared for. We received so many compliments about how wonderful the service was. The food was incredible, thanks to Chef Andrew, who crafted a delicious meal that our guests are still raving about. And of course, the drinks were flowing thanks to our fantastic bartenders, Constantine and Connor. They kept the bar moving, mixed great cocktails, and added so much fun to the celebration. Overall, Stallion Mountain by Wedgewood exceeded our expectations in every way. Their team made our wedding feel seamless, joyful, and truly unforgettable. We couldn’t be more grateful and would recommend them wholeheartedly to any couple looking for the perfect venue and a team that genuinely cares.
