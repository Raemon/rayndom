This is where we were introduced to Sandra and we couldn’t have hit more of a home run with her as our wedding planner. We didn’t fully understand what it took to plan a wedding and I can confidently say we would’ve been completely lost without Sandra. She is detail oriented, creative, proactive, and was able to give us our dream wedding through a collaborative year long planning. Sandra was always available and alleviated all of the stress that goes into planing a wedding. My wife and I had bits and pieces of a vision we had for our big day which Sandra was able to bring to life. Sandra coordinated with our vendors, created a schedule, and made our big day stress free. We loved that we were able to enjoy the day and spend time with our guests because of how well planned and timely everything was. Our guests raved about the little details, food, and amazing night of partying. Truly a night that we will never forget and we wouldn’t have been able to do it without Sandra and her team. Pairing the most perfect venue with the most amazing planner made for a dream wedding. We would highly recommend utilizing LWTD for your big day.

They made me so happy because they were absolutely perfect, and I credit that entirely to Amanda’s dedication and collaboration with Emporio, the preferred floral vendor at Hard Rock Los Cabos. Florals were the wedding detail I cared about the most, and they also caused me the most worry. They hold such a special place in my heart because I believe they truly accentuate the beauty of a wedding. From the moment Amanda stepped in, she eased all my anxieties. She was dedicated, focused, and meticulous in her attention to detail. She was assertive in communicating my needs to the vendor, efficient in coordinating every step, proactive in addressing potential challenges, and direct in making sure my vision was honored exactly as I imagined. Her strong and trusted relationship with Emporio made all the difference. They clearly respect and value her, which ensured flawless execution and also saved me thousands of dollars. That kind of value comes from her experience, credibility, and deep commitment to her clients. Because of Amanda, my my most treasured design element was in the very best hands. If you have the opportunity to work with her, I recommend it wholeheartedly. She is worth every penny and more.”Anastasia L., 5 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/4d1f1f9a-16a4-4225-b0fc-e7b88ac1c1cf?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/amanda-antonetti-events)

From the very beginning, I said my part in the planning was done & I was handing it off to her. I wanted to just enjoy and take in all of the moments of my wedding & not be bothered by the details or hiccups. Her communication style was attentive, prompt, and she was easy to communicate with. I only had to explain things once & she took it from there. She was always quick to respond to our questions and keep us updated on the planning process. On the day of the wedding, Krysta’s detail-oriented approach was evident. Any issues that arose were handled completely by the Krysta before I even found out. She was always there, so I never had to go searching for her. Her commitment to ensuring our special day went off without a hitch was greatly appreciated, and we are so glad we didn’t try to do this without her.

AWE Planner 5.0

  * Offers 5 services

  * Serves San Ramon, CA

As the founder of AWE Planner, you might wonder: How did she become a planner? How many events do we coordinate each year? What inspires us about this work? For founder Jenn Greel, becoming a wedding and event planner was a natural path. Her journey began with bartending private events, and planning gatherings for friends, which eventually spared the idea of launching her own planning business. From our first wedding fair to signing our first client-who happened to be a coworker at the time-AWE Planner was built from scratch. With every event we've learned, grown, and harnessed our experiences to shape the outstanding team we are today.“Jenn is amazing! We booked her "A Little Bit of Help" package but truly got so much more than advertised. From the start, she helped us stay on track with booking vendors, planning logistics, and did a walk through of our venues to help us create our dream wedding. She also helped us research vendors within our price range (I highly recommend the taqueria she connected us with in the area!). Jenn was available at all times via text and email, which made the planning process feel effortless. She has an extensive inventory of décor items that we were able to borrow, including table signs, centerpiece vases, sign easels, photo frames, a gift card box, and more. On top of that, she is an expert florist who brought our vision to life through stunning church arrangements, bouquets, and centerpieces. On the wedding day, Jenn was calm, level-headed, and quick on her feet. She seamlessly managed our large and lively Asian family during a long photography session and kept everyone happy. She also created a detailed timeline, coordinated with all our vendors, and kept everything running smoothly. Thanks to her, we truly felt like guests at our own wedding -- something we didn't think was possible. If you want a coordinator who is organized, creative, professional, and genuinely invested in making your day perfect, Jenn is the one.”Rachel L., 5 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/15f0dd95-c35d-489c-8c89-186d02c4f049?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/awe-planner)

She also helped a ton with planning the full schedule for the day and had a good sense of how long each thing would take.

As your partner in the planning process, I'll help uncover goals and priorities, providing timelines and to-do lists that work without the overwhelm. I work closely with vendors and communicate the expectations for the wedding day so everyone is on the same page and can execute a seamless experience for couples and their guests.“We had the most wonderful experience working with Samantha Gruwell for our Nov 2021 Deer Park Villa wedding. She did the month of coordination and it was the best decision we could have made. We were feeling overwhelmed with all of the details that still needed ironed out those last few weeks leading up the wedding, and Sam was so helpful in getting everything organized, and really put us at ease. She took control of communication with all our vendors (venue, photographer, caterer, DJ, florist) and ensured our special day had a well planned schedule that ran seamlessly. Sam was so hands-on throughout the entire process. We did multiple zoom calls to go over details and questions, and she did a walk through of the venue with us a few weeks prior. She helped us organize our rehearsal to ensure the ceremony had the right timing and flow. And she helped us perfectly execute it on the day of. She even stuck around through the very end of the evening and helped to dismantle some of the flowers and decor. Sam really put her heart and soul into ensuring our wedding day went flawlessly, and she’s also one of the kindest, most thoughtful people you’ll meet. Our wedding was an absolute dream, and we owe it all to Sam for making our dream a reality!

I was born and raised in a beautiful valley in Western Colorado. I prefer living in small towns, but I like visiting big cities and finding all the best restaurants. Even though I spent most of my life in the west, I am enjoying the opportunity of living in new places.

From the start, Mikelle demonstrated active listening, respect, and responsiveness, ensuring our vision was brought to life.

2 Friends Events was established in 2010 by...2 Friends! Lindsey and I met as co-maids of honor in our friend Wendi's wedding. We loved working together, so we decided to take a chance and start our own event planning company. Lindsay has since retired to be with her family and I now run 2 Friends Events with the help of my amazing team.“There is no question that choosing 2 Friends Events as our wedding planner was the best decision we made throughout the process. (And of course, we made a lot of other smart and delightful decisions thanks to the 2FE team!) From our first call through the week after our wedding, Nichole and her team provided us constant support, seamless logistics and research, and brought so much joy to the planning process. As our planner, Nichole listened, helped keep us focused on what we said was important to us, and was always five steps ahead with her proactivity and organization. And my goodness, did she bring our vision to life! Everything from it being colorful and vibrant to finding an ADA friendly venue to incorporating our dog and favorite beverage Spindrift to herding us all on the wedding day (no strong feat!). Last but not least, each person we interacted with was just kind and a good human being. When we had a family crisis the weeks leading up to the wedding, she immediately helped pull together contingency plans. We couldn’t have been more grateful for everything they did for us. Thank you, Nichole and team! Trust us, you won’t regret choosing 2 Friends Events.”Marie and D., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/2-friends-events)
