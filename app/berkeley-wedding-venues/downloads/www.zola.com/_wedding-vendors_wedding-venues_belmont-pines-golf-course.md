From the moment we booked Belmont Pines Golf Course for our wedding, the communication with their team was efficient, thorough, and open. Courtney VanLeuven, the venue coordinator, listened intently to all of our needs and desires for our daughter's special day and handled every detail seamlessly. The venue itself was clean, natural, and beautifully maintained, providing the perfect backdrop for our wedding celebration. The Belmont Pines staff went above and beyond to ensure our day ran smoothly, offering full-service support from start to finish. We are so grateful for their thoughtful and attentive service, which allowed us to fully enjoy our wedding without a single worry. We highly recommend Belmont Pines Golf Course to any couple seeking a stress-free, gorgeous wedding experience.

Belmont Pines Golf Course was the perfect venue for our event. From the start, Courtney was incredibly responsive, clear in her communication, and showed genuine compassion and accommodation throughout the planning process. Courtney, and the staff, went above and beyond to support us and ensure every detail was taken care of. She made us feel so cared for and truly made the day easier for us and our families. The flexibility they offered with planning, along with the ability to utilize both the outdoor and indoor spaces, allowed us to have the beautiful, seamless event we had envisioned.

I recently attended a wedding at Belmont Pines, and it was one of the most well run and beautiful events I've been to. The setting was absolutely gorgeous - lush greens, perfect views, and a peaceful atmosphere. Everything from the ceremony to the reception flowed smoothly, and the staff attentive without being intrusive. You could tell the couple were relaxed and genuinely happy. It was an honor to be part of such a special day in such a perfect setting!
