![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Callippe Preserve Golf Course was an absolute dream venue for our wedding! From the moment we first reached out, Morgan Chandler and her team were friendly, responsive, and kind throughout the entire planning process. They went above and beyond to ensure our special day was gorgeous and professional in every way. When we encountered a few bumps along the way, they took care of it right away without any fuss. The staff at the venue was incredible as well! Setting up all of our decor, serving dinner and everything in between took so much stress off of my plate and I will always be so grateful! The venue itself was breathtaking, and our guests raved about the beautiful scenery and fantastic service. We are so grateful to the Callippe Preserve team for helping to make our wedding day truly unforgettable.”Becky M., 8 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/339d6ce2-6d53-45b9-b59f-da575c2c7c18?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/callippe-preserve-golf-course)
