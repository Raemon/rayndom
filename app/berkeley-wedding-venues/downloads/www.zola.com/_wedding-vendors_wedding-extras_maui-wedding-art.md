  * ### Amazing! 

•Verified review

•Kennedy F.•Dec 14, 2025

We were beyond lucky to have Ariel as part of our wedding day! Watching him work during the reception was incredibly special for both us and our guests. We originally found Ariel while searching for something truly unique for guest gifts and asked if he would be able to commission small individual canvases for each of our guests to take home as their own one-of-a-kind piece of art from the day, along with three larger paintings for us to begin our art collection. Not only did Ariel embrace the idea, but he also offered several thoughtful options and took the time to hop on a call to walk us through everything. Once we finalized our vision, he kept us informed every step of the way, sending examples as he worked—which only made us more excited leading up to the wedding. On the wedding day itself, it was incredible to watch Ariel live painting and interacting with our guests throughout the reception. We received so many compliments on both him and his work, and we’re still getting photos from guests as they hang their pieces in their own homes. Ariel was also so gracious in taking personal requests throughout the day, which truly went above and beyond. Ariel was a joy to work with and was kind, professional, and genuinely passionate about his craft, exactly the kind of person you want as part of your wedding day! For anyone considering a live artist, we truly cannot recommend Ariel enough!

Response from vendor•Dec 15, 2025

Mahalo so much, Kennedy. Reading this truly made my day. Working with you was incredibly inspiring. Your vision for personalized guest paintings and beginning your own art collection was thoughtful, meaningful, and genuinely exciting from an artistic standpoint. This kind of collaboration is a dream for any artist who loves customizing the experience to reflect a couple’s story, and I honestly wish more couples felt empowered to bring ideas like this to life. What stayed with me most was how many guests shared their emotional connection to the paintings. Knowing that each piece represented real places around Four Seasons Hualalai, and that those locations already held memories of engagements, past weddings, and love stories on the Big Island, gave the work so much depth and heart. That shared sense of place and history made the experience feel truly special. Thank you for your trust, your openness, and the warmth you and your guests showed me throughout the day. It was an honor to be part of your celebration and to create something that will live on in so many homes. Wishing you both a lifetime filled with love, art, and beautiful memories. Me ke aloha, Ariel

## Frequently asked questions

11 Answers

Ask them a question

### What is a live wedding painting?

A live wedding painting is a unique form of art where I create a painting of your wedding scene in real-time during the event. It captures the atmosphere, emotions, and special moments, providing both entertainment for your guests and a lasting keepsake for you.

### Can I choose the moment to be painted?

Absolutely! Whether it's your first kiss, first dance, ceremony, or any other special moment, I work with you to decide which scene you'd like immortalized on canvas. We can also discuss incorporating multiple moments into one painting if desired.

### Can guests be included in the painting?

Yes, guests can be included. Typically, I focus on the couple and key elements of the scene, but I can add specific guests upon request. We'll discuss this beforehand to ensure everyone's captured as you'd like.

### What materials do you use?

Materials I Use Live Wedding Paintings (Oil on Canvas) I paint with oil on gallery-wrapped, pre-gessoed canvas for rich color and timeless depth. Watercolor Portraits Soft washes using professional watercolors on cold-pressed paper for an elegant touch. Guest Portraits on Canvas (Acrylic) Bold acrylics on canvas—fast-drying and vibrant, perfect for take-home art. Sketch Drawings Simple, expressive pencil and ink marker sketches on quality drawing paper.

### How long does it take to complete the painting?

I paint live at your wedding, bringing the scene to life with vibrant brushstrokes as your guests watch the magic unfold. Before I leave the venue, the painting is already virtually finished and ready to be admired. After the event, I take the piece back to my studio where I refine the details, enhance the portrait quality, and ensure everything looks its absolute best. I also apply a protective varnish, allow it to dry properly, and carefully pack and ship the final artwork to you. This process ensures not only a stunning finished piece, but also the most professional and convenient service possible, so you can simply enjoy your celebration.

### What is the cost of a live wedding painting?

My live wedding painting packages range from $1,700 to $5,400, depending on the canvas size, level of detail, and amount of studio refinement. Each package includes live painting on-site, a personalized consultation, and professional finishing in my studio. Travel fees apply for events outside of Maui. I offer a variety of options — from expressive alla prima pieces to luxurious, museum-quality heirlooms. Let’s connect to create a quote that fits your vision and ensures a one-of-a-kind keepsake of your day.

### Do you travel for weddings?

Yes, I travel for weddings across Hawaii and beyond. Travel fees will be included in your custom quote based on the event location.

### How do we book your services?

To book, please contact me to check availability. Once confirmed, a 50% deposit and signed contract are required to secure your date. The remaining balance is due two weeks before the event.

### How far in advance should we book?

I recommend booking as early as possible — ideally 12 to 18 months in advance — especially for popular dates during peak wedding season. This helps secure your spot and gives us plenty of time to plan something truly special. That said, if your date is coming up soon, don’t hesitate to reach out! I occasionally have last-minute openings and would love to check availability for you. Whether you're planning ahead or just around the corner, I’m here to help make your day unforgettable.

### How do we book your services?

To book, please contact me to check availability. Once confirmed, a 50% deposit is required to secure your date. The remaining balance is due two weeks before the event.

### Do you offer framing or prints?

While framing isn't included, I can recommend local framers or provide guidance on framing options. Additionally, I offer high-quality prints of your painting upon request.
