Weddings by Katherine Marchand 5.0

  * Editorial style
  * Starts at $4,000 
  * Serves Berkeley, CA

I'm Katherine, a wedding photographer based in Oakland, CA. With over a decade of experience and features in Vogue, Brides, The New York Times, and more, I know how to create wedding photos that don’t just look stunning — they feel like you. No trendy filters, no forced poses, just authentic moments that reflect who you are. I believe the best moments aren’t staged. They unfold naturally, in the quiet glances, the belly laughs, and those unspoken connections shared with your loved ones. My goal is to capture those raw, in-between moments that truly make your wedding day yours!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Hiring Katherine was hands down the best decision we made for our wedding. Every single aspect of working with her was perfect: from the first phone consultation to engagement photos, rehearsal dinner, wedding, and every call, email, and question in between. Katherine makes you feel like you're talking to an old friend from the moment you meet her- she is warm, fun, funny, kind, and just knows how to put you at ease in front of the camera. We had a clear vision of what we wanted for our photos and she beyond exceeded our expectations. Every time I look through our photo gallery (which she delivered SO quickly) I find a new favorite, even 1.5 years after our wedding. She truly captured the feeling of being there from the intimate setting of our rehearsal dinner to the rowdy wedding reception. I cannot thank Katherine enough for being such a large part of making our wedding perfect!”Rachel, a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/e788559f-3c80-4af0-b0a7-414d25915db1?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/weddings-by-katherine-marchand)

From the very first interaction, EJ & Sarah's communication was exceptional. They made us feel comfortable and confident every step of the way, ensuring that every detail was covered and that our vision was understood. Their organizational skills were impeccable, leaving us stress-free and able to enjoy our big day. On the wedding day, their team was phenomenal. They were everywhere, capturing every special moment, yet they were so discreet that we barely noticed their presence. Their creativity and attention to detail were evident in every shot. The candid moments especially, were some of our favorites. When we received the teaser film and the photos, Meredith and I were left speechless. The quality and artistry of their work are beyond words. Every shot, every frame was beautifully, bringing out the emotions and joy of the day in a way that we will cherish forever. Their passion and dedication were clear in every aspect, from the carefully planned photo setups to the spontaneous video moments they were able to capture. EJ & Sarah are not just talented professionals; they are wonderful people who genuinely care about making your wedding day as special as it can be. We have recommended their services to everyone we know who is looking to capture their special day. They are a dream team, and we couldn't have asked for a better experience.

Connie Leal Photography 5.0

  * Editorial style
  * Starts at $2,200 
  * Serves Berkeley, CA

My name is Connie and I have been shooting weddings and portraits for over 15years. The goal for me is to give my client an heirloom of their wedding day to pass down to generations to come. As a young kid, I remember staring at my parents black and white wedding photos for a long time. It captivated me. I am very lucky to have those memories and that is what I want for my clients. I love capturing beautiful imagery through posing, beautiful light and when there isn't light, I like to create it. I can be a goof ball capturing the unexpected filled laughter. Come look at my work, and hopefully we can connect.“Connie was so awesome to work with! Leading up to the wedding she was easy to communicate with and always responded to my emails quickly. When my wedding day rolled around she was at the venue on time and got to work. She was patient with everything going on, she had an assistant as well that was great! I told Connie that I was worried about taking pictures because I never considered myself photogenic, she told me not to worry. She did a great job! The pictures turned out beautiful! I love them!

Welcome. "I BELIEVE...connection matters. Photos tell our story and carry our legacy. Melanin matters on camera. Every human deserves to be seen. 8 out of 10 humans say they feel awkward in front of the camera; Laughter is the antidote." ​ It is my loud passion to capture the personality of relationship...within couples, families, communities, and even organizations. And I have been this way since I was a kid. With my hot pink camera in tow, 8-year old me would capture the loud joy of my BIG extended family. Little did I know...they were my training ground in photography. And I am happy to say that my approach to photography hasn't changed.“Brandi was amazing to work with! We couldn’t have asked for a better photographer or a better experience! From our first virtual meeting with Brandi we knew that we made the right choice! Brandi has an amazing personality and we could tell right away that she was passionate about not only photography but about people too!! On our wedding day Brandi worked hard to bring our vision to life and exceeded all of our expectations! Our photos were amazing! We have received so many compliments on our photos! We are so thankful that Brandi was a part of our big day! I only wish that we lived closer so that Brandi could capture more of our memories!!”CaShena S., 24 days ago![](https://images.zola.com/1a8871be-c311-4f97-ae93-d0e3c5b66fc9?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/brandi-rollins-photography)

Offbeat Photography with a Narrative Twist. I've been having fun photographing weddings for over 18 years. I find the excitement, nervousness, love, and joy inspiring to create great photographs that tell a story. I have been in love with photography since I've been a kid. Since then I have photographed actors, film directors, authors, and some very unique characters that have informed my perspective on life.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We hired Pat to do photographs for our wedding in 2016 - which was an informal event in our back garden in San Francisco with our family and friends on a glorious July day. Pat was lovely to work with. We only needed to chat a few times beforehand. And then on the day, she was a discreet, low-key presence - but somehow managed to capture us, our family, and friends in a joyous celebration.”Tori and S., 4 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/pat-mazzera-photography)

I’m a SF Bay Area photographer with almost seven years of experience capturing life’s quiet, beautiful moments, from the anticipation of maternity to the tenderness of newborn days and the joy of growing families. In the past year, I found myself drawn to something new: weddings. I began second shooting and quickly realized how much I loved being part of a couple’s most meaningful day. But it was the micro weddings and elopements that truly spoke to me .Intimate, intentional celebrations where every detail feels personal and every moment holds weight.“From the moment we first connected with By ASTERIA Weddings, their efficient, friendly, and detail-oriented communication style put us at ease. Their professional and organized presence on the day of our wedding allowed us to relax and truly enjoy each moment, confident that every special detail was being beautifully documented. The quality of their work was exceptional - the photos are aesthetic, elegant, and creatively captured, perfectly reflecting the joy and emotion of our day. The gallery was delivered promptly and organized perfectly, making it easy for us to relive every part of our wedding through their high-quality, timeless photos. We are thrilled with the work of By ASTERIA Weddings and would highly recommend them to any couple looking for a talented and dedicated photography team to capture their big day.”Xochil, 3 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/by-asteria-weddings--2)

With a candid style and two decades of professional photography experience, my passion is capturing real moments and creating photos that tell your story. Living in the San Francisco Bay Area, I am proud to work in the diverse communities here, and welcome the diversity of my clients who are looking to both honor past family traditions as well as create some of their own. My approach to wedding photography is simple; the day of the wedding is about two people coming together to celebrate their marriage with their loved ones, and photos are about connection and trust. My goal is to have your photographs remind you of how you felt that day.“Sonya was amazing, she photographed our engagement and our Indian wedding ceremony. Even without being totally familiar with the parts of the ceremony, she captured all the pivotal moments beautifully. she is very intuitive and made us feel very comfortable. We loved the slide show she put together with the photos from our day, and sent it to our families who watch it on repeat. We can't recommend her enough, she is not only artistic, but a really nice person which made it so much easier. She was also able to keep our rowdy families in-line for the group photos.”Carter, 6 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/sonya-yruel-photography)

I am an Oklahoma born, but Cali raised - dancer, roller skater, photography stylist, photographer, momma to two little girls, foodie, crafter, lover of laughter, action and pyscho-thriller movie watcher, and sports player. I also find peace in the outdoors and California trees. I like to keep it active and adventurous. I believe in giving 110% at everything I do, but also want it to be fun. I chose photography to be my vocation because I have a true obsession with humans and the way we love, interact, and celebrate rituals personal to our families and cultures. I stand up for equality and justice for BIPOC and LGBTTQQIAAP.“Joy was so amazing from start to finish! We booked Joy and her team for our Engagement session and Wedding Day. She helped brainstorm ideas for the engagement shoot and made all our visions a reality with bomb photos of us featuring my husbands old school. As all brides know, the planning experience can be stressful and full of anxiety dealing with multiple vendors - but I never had that experience working with Joy. I 100% trusted her to capture our big day. I’ve heard stories from other brides about “I wish our photographer did this, was able to take photos of that..” but not with Joy! She communicated great leading up to and on the big day. Everywhere I looked Joy and her team was on the move capturing the best shots in the right spots. Our photos turned out amazing and we were so happy to have Joy there with us on such a memorable day. I highly recommend and trust Joy for any photo sessions, whether it’s family holiday shoots, grad photos, engagement sessions and wedding day! She is an absolute gem, so talented and pleasure to work with!”Mari + L., 5 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/joy-coakley-studio)

Hi, I’m Onix, but everyone calls me OJ. I’m a photographer based in the Bay Area, originally from Puerto Rico. When I moved to California I brought with me the dream of capturing moments that feel real and meaningful. I specialize in City Hall weddings and romantic couples sessions. I love creating warm, natural and emotional images while guiding every couple so they feel comfortable and confident. Every session matters to me and I put care into every detail. If you want photos that truly reflect your connection, I would be honored to work with you.“OjRocket Media was an exceptional wedding photography vendor for our big day. From the very first interaction, their communication style was extremely elaborate and detail-oriented, putting us at ease throughout the entire process. The quality of their work was truly professional and of great value - they captured all the special moments beautifully. On the day of our wedding, the OjRocket team made us feel incredibly special and executed exactly what we wanted, even coming up with amazing pose ideas that we would have never thought of on our own.

Meg Sexton Photography 5.0

  * Editorial style
  * Starts at $10,000 
  * Serves Berkeley, CA

I've been photographing weddings in the San Francisco Bay Area for over 16 years, and what keeps me coming back is the same thing that drew me in from the start: those fleeting, unguarded moments that you can't stage or recreate. The way you hold your breath before walking down the aisle. The look you exchange when you think no one's watching. The quiet, tender moments that happen in between all the big ones.“I have had the pleasure of working with Meg on countless weddings and shoots and I can honestly say after watching her in action for years that she is super talented, professional, and fun/easy to work with! She caters her photos to each client so it's personal and full of each couple's personality - even if you don't really like taking photos, Meg makes the process easy and fun! And the icing on the cake is that her work is absolutely beautiful - you'll be so excited to display your photos! If you're looking for a professional photographer who not only takes beautiful photos that you'll cherish for a lifetime, but is a pro who communicates really well with her clients, and really works with each couple to make their photos session personal to them, look no further - you wont regret it!”Lisa, 5 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/meg-sexton-photography)

Radostina (rhymes with “patina”) was born and raised in the coastal town of Varna, Bulgaria. After finishing her Master’s in Arts, she moved to the Czech Republic, where she began her career in graphic design, styling, and art direction. It was there, in the middle of her Czech adventure, that the passion for film photography was born. Now, an award-winning fine art wedding photographer, Radostina resides in San Francisco, with her husband Martin and their English bulldog, Fuji.“We are so happy that we chose Radostina to capture our special moment. Everything was smooth and contributed to the overall experience - from the initial contact to photographing the event to delivering the stunning photos. Radostina's attention for detail is second to none and her taste is impeccable, she gave us great ideas before and during the event on how to capture every moment in a way that we can preserve our memories. The colors, the captured light and the emotions on the pictures are just mesmerizing, probably because it was captured on film. We'd love to have Radostina capture another special moment for us in the future.”M + R., 6 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/radostina-boseva-photography)

From the very first interaction, Alec's communication style was fun, professional, and incredibly personable. He had a true passion for his craft that shone through in every interaction. The quality of Alec's work was absolutely stunning - we got a wonderful variety of candids, formal shots, and editorial-style pictures that captured all the special moments of our day. Alec has an incredible eye for the right shots, and the final photos are absolutely gorgeous. Despite a complicated location schedule that I was worried about, Alec made the whole day seamless, traveling to over 4 different spots to ensure we got all the groupings and special shots we wanted.

Hi, I’m Isaac. In my world, light is everything. The cool ambient hues at dawn, hinting at what the day may bring. Golden sun rays catching particles through a tree as friends gathers to celebrate. A Cotton candy sunset peppered by patio string-lights as a DJ plays my favorite song. We all have timeless memories logged in our minds. For me, they are based in a language of light. As a wedding photographer, this deep connection to special lighting helps me produce dynamic visual stories of romance, personality and beauty.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“A few things that stood out the most about Isaac were how responsive he was, how he was able to accommodate to our budget, and how he took pictures from angles and views that turned out great on the photos. As a couple with demanding careers, I much appreciated how quickly Isaac was with replying to emails. We had a pretty tight budget, and Isaac was able to offer us a package that landed pretty close to our budget and only had the items that we needed the most (mini engagement photoshoot for the website and wedding day). Our ask for him was to get some candid shots as we feel pretty awkward in front of the camera. I personally think that the wedding day pictures came out more naturally because of the setting being surrounded with friends and families, and Isaac and Sushen did a great job capturing the candid moments beautifully. Isaac even had an idea for me to pose by climbing up a wooden stair ladder for a shot that I honestly wasn't sure how it was going to turn out while doing it, but it ended up turning out beautiful and magazine-like in addition to other ones that he asked us to pose for. Isaac put together a behind the scenes video that also showed the reactions of guests to our photo place cards before we had entered the reception area, and this was lovely in that we got to see our guests' reactions that we weren't able to see.”Rafy, a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/c08a0a6d-4be1-4bcc-8862-b11731c8d945?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/love-knot-photography)

Danny Captures Photography 5.0

  * Editorial style
  * Starts at $2,900 
  * Serves Berkeley, CA

Hi, I'm Danny! My passion is to capture couples & their love story in a timeless way. I like to describe my style as a fusion between story-telling & editorial. I lean into true-to-life colors with a warm ambience and posing that's timeless but also interwoven with an editorial flare that's unique, artistic, and stylish. I also love incorporating story-telling stills that involve movement rather than a bunch of photos that feel "stiff" or overly posed. Story-telling moments bring wedding galleries life! I’d love the opportunity to connect with you, and hear more about your wedding vision!!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Danny is an amazing photographer to work with, he is extremely professional and organized and will deliver the most beautiful photos. His attention to detail is immaculate. We chose to work with Danny for both our engagement and wedding day photos. Moments that I didn’t even know I needed to see again were captured in film, and now I have these extraordinary photos forever! I would highly recommend working with Danny for any of your wedding related photos, you will not regret it! :)”Samantha G., 23 days ago![](https://images.zola.com/5dac2c18-40ad-4191-afa9-92cb09f5bf1b?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/danny-captures-photography)
