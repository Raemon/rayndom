From the moment we booked, we knew we were in the best hands — and they exceeded every single expectation. The venue itself was stunning and the ceremony space took our breath away. It was the most romantic, picturesque setting we could have imagined, and our guests were just as blown away as we were. On top of that, the price was so reasonable for everything that was included — truly such a rare gem! Raul, Madison, and Michael were the dream team. They were professional, attentive, and just genuinely wonderful people. They made us feel supported and celebrated throughout the entire planning process and especially on the day of. One of the sweetest touches? Right after the ceremony, they welcomed us with a drink in hand — a small but thoughtful gesture that instantly helped calm the nerves and let us soak in the joy of the moment. Their recommended vendors were also top-tier — from the florals to the DJ to the catering, everything came together seamlessly. The level of organization, communication, and passion they brought to the table made it feel effortless on our end. We truly got to enjoy every second of our day without stress. It was the best wedding ever — beautiful, joyful, and unforgettable.

“We hosted our annual company party at Canyon Crest Country Club, and it was an incredible experience from start to finish. The staff was professional, attentive, and went above and beyond to make sure everything ran smoothly. The banquet room looked amazing, the food was delicious (seriously—everyone was raving about the short Tri-Tip!), and the view from the patio was the perfect backdrop for photos. Tom and the events team were super easy to work with and helped us customize the setup to match our theme. The bartender and servers were friendly and fast, and even the smallest details were handled with care. We’ll definitely be booking again next year. Highly recommend Canyon Crest for any corporate event or celebration!”Jacob, 7 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/canyon-crest-country-club)

It was very convenient that the venue coordinating all the setup, lining up the officiant, the DJ, the ceremony, food/appetizers, and worked extremely well with all the teaming partners including flowers and other vendors we opted for.

“We had the absolute best experience having our wedding at Tijeras Creek from start to finish. Logan and Bryce were our points of contact and they made every piece of the planning process seamless. We opted not to have a day of coordinator and the way the Tijeras Creek team was there for us, felt like the same level of support. They had a ton of recommendations for vendors if we needed (we used the DJ they recommended and he was amazing!) The backdrop of the ceremony was picture perfect. They also had a bunch of recommendations for spots on the course to take our photos after the ceremony and gave us a golf carts to use with our photographer. The communication was always very thorough and quick to get back to me on the millions of questions I asked. They have a ton of options for food selection and style of service but we really had our heart set on Mexican food. We had been to Tijeras Creek for their Taco Tuesday so we asked if we could have that as an option. They were more than happy to accommodate and our guests RAVED about how good the food was! Everything about our wedding day was a 10/10. Thank you Tijeras Creek team!!!”Lauren E., 2 years ago![](https://images.zola.com/ec984d3e-03a4-4dfb-a5f2-5297b1dd1b1b?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/tijeras-creek-golf-club--2)

From the meetings with Rochelle and ease setting up the contract, to her prompt replies and answering every question, to making the night super special, to Derek the Catering Manager refusing to let me help set up my tablescapes because I had a Ortho boot on my foot :) so he brought in 2 wonderful helpers, to the delicious buffet prepared perfectly by the chef (honestly the ONLY complaint of the entire evening was why we couldn't take home a ton of buffet leftovers :) to the bartender going the extra mile with a smile and running back to the clubhouse for us when my sister changed her mind and did in fact want a glass of champagne served at our bar station (not her original request), to Sean at Lumi Events for the BEST DJ/Photo booth/lighting/video production (contracted and recommended by Rochelle thankfully), I WILL most definitely be using this venue and vendors again.

Siera, Omar, and Ty were all amazing, but the whole staff at Sierra La Verne truly went above and beyond to make our special day perfect. We are so grateful for their outstanding service and highly recommend this venue to any couple planning their wedding.”Courtney O., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/14bb5ac3-f92b-4ffb-a755-518c72a7609b?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/sierra-la-verne-by-wedgewood-weddings)

From the beginning, the communication with the staff was easy, friendly and effective. The outdoor ceremony site was worth every penny - it was beautifully landscaped and provided a gorgeous backdrop for our vows. While the indoor reception venue was a little tight, the staff did a great job coordinating the event flow and ensuring everything ran smoothly. The servers were friendly and attentive, and the food was delicious. A special shoutout to Hannah, Jordan and Shelby - they were amazing and helped make our special day perfect.”Harvey T., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/ac44301d-8be4-4a89-a524-b248949f0adc?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/coyote-hills-golf-course)

“The Grand Theater was a beautiful wedding venue, with a stunning space and amazing food. The staff was awesome and very attentive to our needs. However, we did have some issues with their communication and payment processes. There were a few instances where payments failed to go through due to their system having an error and they didn't tell us until days later. Towards the end, they also tried to overcharge us but we were able to catch these errors by referencing our contract. They quickly fixed the issues, but it was a bit frustrating to have to double-check and get everything sorted. Overall, the venue and staff were great, but be sure to carefully review your contract and keep on top of all payments to avoid any problems. I don't think any of the issues we had were malicious or done intentionally so I would recommend them!”Michaela A., a year ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-grand-theater)

“South Hills Country Club was an absolute dream to work with for our wedding. Their communication was so easy, they have great packages and they really allow you to personalize the space to bring your vision to life. The venue itself is just stunning, with beautiful arch windows, high ceilings and an amazing fireplace that provided the perfect photo moment. Not to mention all the areas on the golf course that you can take bridal party photos at. I was fortunate to work with Abi and Evan, they really helped answer all of our questions, which was so valuable since most people don't have experience planning weddings and I chose not to hire a wedding coordinator. Abi and Evan helped me every step of the way and were there at the event to make sure things ran smoothly. Abi even texted me through the morning to update me on how set up is going just to put my anxious mind at ease. I also have to mention how great the food is, it’s not your average hotel wedding dish. They really let you customize the dish from the proteins to the sauce and have so many options for hors d’oeuvres. The whole team at South Hills went above and beyond to make our special day perfect and I couldn’t be more grateful to have found them.”Melissa, 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/1ffddc63-f9a5-41bf-8f86-dba6039ddde3?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/south-hills-country-club)

![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Just had our wedding here on 9/28/24 and wow where can I start??! From the beginning when we toured the venue, we had no idea what to expect considering this was one of the more relatively lower budget venues we were touring at. So imagine our surprise when we got there and saw this venue, which was even more gorgeous than the more expensive ones we looked at previously. Pictures don’t really do this place justice. The venue has a Spanish-colonial design which makes for a perfect backdrop for photos. The arches both outside and inside the building really makes it feel grand. The string lights in the courtyard are so pretty, both in the daylight and when they’re lit up at nighttime. The hills of rolling green grass in the background really give off that golf club aesthetic and all the palm trees around the venue really pop off and give California vibes. The view of the grassy lawn and palm trees I saw when I walked down the aisle was truly breathtaking and I’ll never forget this moment. But mostly, we were in such good hands with Michael as the director. He comes from tons of experience (over 2000 weddings) and really treats your special day with so much empathy and care. Him and Mayra helped us out in so many ways: -Set up our welcome table, seating chart display, and decorations with very little direction. I didn’t have time during rehearsal to let them know how and where to set it up, and when the wedding day came, everything was already set up so beautifully. -We didn’t know we had to ask for a mic from our DJ, so we didn’t have one, and Michael took care of that problem very quickly. -Michael walked me around the back entrance of the venue before I walked down the aisle, my pointy heels kept getting stuck in the ripped hole in my wedding dress and Michael helped me pull it out twice. -Mayra helped me change into my 2nd wedding dress when I wasn’t able to find my bridesmaids near me. -Michael swept up the fake money off the floor during reception, and also hand delivered us our signature drinks when we asked for them. -I requested a signature drink that they’ve never made before and Michael personally tried out a bunch of recipes and helped pick out the best one. Overall, Michael and Mayra put so much care and thought towards this special moment of our lives. With this venue, you get it all-the perfect coordinators and the most beautiful setting. Some other things to note-food was amazing, both cocktail hour and reception. The food was also plated and presented very well too. The only area of improvement would be that there is no bridal/groom suite. It wasn’t an issue for us since there is a fitting room on site. But in the future, it there is an opportunity, building a bridal/groom suite would improve the experience for others greatly.”Gina S., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/c7f88ac8-80a8-490d-98b4-8639cffb3fa5?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/talega-golf-club)

“Working with Tawnya (and Spencer) at Recreation 18 was such a wonderful experience. After viewing the venue for the first time and meeting with Tawnya, we knew this was the venue we wanted to use to celebrate our special day. The venue is incredible and so beautiful and had every amenity we needed and wanted. Tawnya was so easy to work with, incredibly communicative, very accommodating and helpful, had great ideas and assisted with additional decor as well. The wedding day went perfectly and was everything we wanted it to be. We cannot express our gratitude enough to Tawnya for all of her help throughout the entire process.”Andraya, 8 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/recreation-park-golf-course-18)

“My husband and I attended their Wedding and Event Showcase to check out local vendors and ended up booking our entire wedding that day! Our original plan was to do a courthouse wedding and a small reception at our home but changed our mind after touring the venue. We fell in love with the Fireside Room. It was cozy, dim with Spanish-style vibes, perfect for a moody romantic wedding I had envisioned our wedding to be. We even decided to have our ceremony on the golf course at First Tee. It was perfect for us and our guests to have both in the same venue. What really convinced us to have our wedding here were our coordinators, Jennifer Flores and Carina Martinez. They were so kind and helpful from the first day we met at the Showcase all the way through to our wedding day. We were on a tight budget and had only two months to plan our 50-guest wedding. They had many different options to choose from. Carina was very patient and helped us choose the package best for us. We could not have asked for a better team. We are so grateful to them and the rest of the team for making our day special. An honorable mention goes to the Director of Food and Beverage, Mr. Jose Chavez. He was amazing! He made sure our menu for our guests was perfect, our His & Hers signature cocktails were exactly how we wanted them, the tables layout, everything! Kudos to him and his bartenders. They did an amazing job the day of our wedding as well as Carina, who stayed until the very end to make sure everything went smoothly. We cannot thank them enough. For the reception dinner we chose the plated meal service and chose the grilled chicken breast with a garlic cream sauce and the braised short rib, mashed potatoes and vegetables. Our guests had the option to choose chicken or beef for dinner. The food was delicious. Our favorite was the braised short rib. We offered our guests a one hour hosted cocktail hour while we took our photos by the lake, prior to entering the Fireside Room for dinner. We highly recommend this venue for weddings and other celebrations. It is a beautiful venue with many options. You will not regret it!”Ingrid B., 21 days ago![](https://images.zola.com/4cc3ebce-3d1b-48cc-8a46-3f14bef641a2?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/lakewood-country-club)

## About wedding venues in El Sobrante, CA

### 

California offers an incredible 840 miles of coastline, 3,000+ wineries and ancient redwoods for your wedding day. When you choose the Golden State, you're getting exceptional natural lighting for your ceremony across diverse settings from Mediterranean coastal zones to alpine mountain backdrops. Each region has its own distinctive character that can perfectly match your vision.

### What Makes California Wedding Venues So Special?

Northern California's Napa Valley welcomes you with rolling vineyards and Spanish colonial architecture where intimate wine cave ceremonies create unforgettable moments. Head to Southern California and you'll find oceanfront venues like Duke's Malibu where you can exchange vows with the Pacific stretching out behind you while enjoying fresh coastal-inspired cuisine. Palm Springs offers dramatic desert venues with mountain backdrops and striking midcentury modern architecture that photographs beautifully.

### How Much Do Wedding Venues in California Cost?

Wedding venues in California typically run between $9,600 and $11,700 which aligns nicely with the national range of $6,500-$12,000. This represents about 18% of your total wedding budget. Your overall costs will vary based on guest count:

  * 50 guests: $26,190
  * 100 guests: $43,692

Accessibility options have improved greatly across California venues in recent years.

### When Should You Book Your California Wedding Venue?

October leads venue inquiries in California with couples typically booking venues about 13 months (400 days) before their wedding date. If you're dreaming of a Northern California wine country wedding during peak season you'll want to book up to 18 months in advance. Southern California venues offer more flexibility especially during winter months when you can still enjoy beautiful weather while potentially securing better rates.
