“We had the absolute best experience with Fairview Laguna Seca! From the very beginning, Danielle was the reason we fell in love with the venue, her energy, warmth, and attention to detail made us feel so confident in our decision. When she transitioned out of her role, we were a little anxious, but then Melissa came in and completely blew us away. Melissa worked with us through the last 6 months of planning and was nothing short of incredible. She listened to every idea, every concern, and somehow made everything happen exactly how we envisioned it. She always made us feel heard, never overwhelmed, and her calm, organized energy was everything we needed. On the day of the wedding, she was a total rockstar. She kept everything running smoothly and still managed to check in with us, make us laugh, and reassure us that everything was under control. We honestly don't know what we would’ve done without her! Amber joined the team just days before the wedding, but you’d never know it. She was so on top of things and jumped right in like she had been with us the whole time. Matt was also amazing, he made sure the day flowed perfectly and kept everything on schedule without ever making us feel rushed. The food was delicious and there was so much of it, our guests are still talking about it! The bartending team was fast, friendly, and so easy to work with. Everyone from the Fairview Laguna Seca team went above and beyond to make our day feel special and stress-free. Our DJ, Ernesto, did an incredible job! He stuck to the vibe we wanted, played every request we had, and kept the dance floor going all night long. And the FLORALS … wow. D'Lily's absolutely nailed it. Every arrangement was stunning, fresh, and picture-perfect. They truly brought our vision to life. We can’t thank the entire Fairview Laguna Seca team enough. Our wedding was a dream, and it's all because of the amazing people who made it happen!”Andrea& Nayeli D., 9 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/5ac1b9a7-b06b-4e82-b0f3-4c1a7d71aa58?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/fairview-laguna-seca)

![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“The Century is an extremely beautiful venue that even pictures can't do justice! Erica Ford at The Century made everything SO easy!! Her organization and attention to detail on top of anticipating my needs because she's just THAT good, was beyond expectations! She kept me sane, helped me make my menu a complete dream (I am the only vegan amongst meat eaters), and accommodated every one of my (last minute) changes! She genuinely cared about us and our dream wedding and did everything she could to make our dreams come true! The chef, the banquet staff, the bar staff, security, everyone was so professional, on top of EVERYTHING, and made it so we had zero worries on our day. Our wedding day was a complete dream, and that's because of The Century and their amazing team of dedicated, professional, caring employees! Speaking of which, Leticia from Hand Creations Floral, their in house florist, brought my visions to life and moved me to tears with her execution! She was so easy to work with, understood our needs and vision with very minimal direction (I knew what I wanted but didn't always know how to vocalize it), and executed beyond my wildest dreams! My bouquet, which were the only flowers I had other than boutonnieres and corsages, exceeded my wildest dreams! The attention to detail, her ability to capture everything I wanted represented, and the sheer beauty could not have been accomplished with anyone else. I will sing the praises of The Century and their team from the rooftops! One of the best decisions we made for our wedding!”Shannon G., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/b63e2ca3-aba8-4189-b12f-ed1156145a68?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-century)
