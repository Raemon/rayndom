I am an irreverent guy who just so happens to create beautiful-rich-vibrant-uniquely-authentic wedding photography in and around the Bay Area, all over California and anywhere there’s beautiful light.

  * ### Work with Russ! His photos are beautiful.

•Verified review

•happybride•Oct 1, 2025

Russ is a fabulous photographer and he delivered an amazing sneak peek (hundreds of photos!) within 24 hours of saying I do. He went above and beyond to capture beautiful memories. He made everyone feel comfortable while also directing us as needed and making sure the photos were stunning. I highly recommend his services. We also loved working with his associate photographer!

  * ### Such a great experience!

We worked with Russ for our wedding and engagement photos and we love his work! Russ was on the recommended list for our venue, and after checking out his portfolio we knew we had to reach out to him. After an initial consult, we chose to go with Russ. We first met Russ at our engagement shoot. We are both relatively shy and uncomfortable in front of the camera, but Russ made us feel at ease. We love our engagement photos and love our wedding photos even more. Russ was so easy to work with on the wedding day - he was on time, communicative, and helpful. He kept our family photos moving and helped organize guests for photos. Our guests even commented on how great Russ was at the wedding. He delivered a (very large) sneak peek within just a few days of the wedding. Overall, Russ is a great guy and an amazing photographer. We would highly recommend Russ to anyone looking for an engagement/wedding photographer!

  * ### Amazing photos!

We couldn't imagine having a better photographer for our wedding than Russ. He's such a professional, took absolutely stunning photos for us, and got the photos back to us lightning fast. If he's available for your date, book him fast before he's taken! We had previously used Russ for our engagement photoshoot at SF MOMA and loved the way the photos came out. With the pandemic making a full wedding tricky, we chose to switch to a micro-wedding, with a few onsite guests and more on Zoom, down in southern California (Malibu) and Russ agreed to drive down from the Bay Area to shoot it for us. He arrived early and covid safe in an N95 mask. He's great at putting you at ease all day. We also love that he mostly uses a photojournalistic/candid style that documents everything but doesn't get in the way of your wedding with lots of distractions and staged photos. He takes colorful and sharp photos that really capture the moment and make you look great and feel like a moviestar.

Russ was an absolute dream to work with. Fun, friendly, great at sorting all the details beforehand and an absolute star on the day. The photos were stunning – we'd initially questioned whether we would even bother with a photographer, but after working with Russ, I can tell you, it is 200% worth it. Me and my husband have never looked so good in a photo in our lives (and likely never will again...). Russ perfectly balanced being a fly on the wall when it mattered (during the ceremony, etc), with giving us some much needed guidance for fun group shots and portraits. I cannot recommend him highly enough. Book him now!!
