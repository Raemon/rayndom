Hi, I’m Athena! As a wedding planner and event coordinator based in Northern CA, I specialize in creating seamless and memorable celebrations. With years of experience in the industry and a background in design consulting, I focus on bringing my clients’ unique visions to life while ensuring a stress-free planning experience. Whether you're dreaming of an intimate gathering or a grand affair, I’m here to guide you every step of the way—from vendor coordination to timeline creation and all the little details in between. My goal is to make the planning process enjoyable and to craft an event that truly reflects you.“One of the things most of our guests complimented us on was how incredible our wedding coordinator was! Athena was an absolute delight to work with for our wedding. From the very first interaction, she was friendly, welcoming, and made us feel at ease throughout the entire planning process. She ensured that every detail of our special day was executed to perfection. Athena herself went above and beyond, dressing up to match our Gatsby wedding theme, bringing me snacks and drinks when she knew everyone else was busy, picking me up and dropping me off as needed throughout the venue, she definitely ensured I was taken care of. She seemed to be everywhere at once, guiding us and our guests through the day seamlessly. I don't know how I would have got through the day without Athena's outstanding support - she is an absolute gem, and I would recommend Athena to any couple looking for an incredible wedding coordinator.

They made me so happy because they were absolutely perfect, and I credit that entirely to Amanda’s dedication and collaboration with Emporio, the preferred floral vendor at Hard Rock Los Cabos. Florals were the wedding detail I cared about the most, and they also caused me the most worry. They hold such a special place in my heart because I believe they truly accentuate the beauty of a wedding. From the moment Amanda stepped in, she eased all my anxieties. She was dedicated, focused, and meticulous in her attention to detail. She was assertive in communicating my needs to the vendor, efficient in coordinating every step, proactive in addressing potential challenges, and direct in making sure my vision was honored exactly as I imagined. Her strong and trusted relationship with Emporio made all the difference. They clearly respect and value her, which ensured flawless execution and also saved me thousands of dollars. That kind of value comes from her experience, credibility, and deep commitment to her clients. Because of Amanda, my my most treasured design element was in the very best hands. If you have the opportunity to work with her, I recommend it wholeheartedly. She is worth every penny and more.”Anastasia L., 5 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/4d1f1f9a-16a4-4225-b0fc-e7b88ac1c1cf?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/amanda-antonetti-events)

The last three months leading up to my wedding were incredibly stressful, but bringing Cynthia on board as our day-of coordinator was one of the best decisions we made. From the moment she stepped in, she brought a sense of calm and control that truly helped relieve so much of the pressure I was feeling. Cynthia is incredibly organized and detail-oriented. She thought of things I never would have, and her preparation gave me the confidence to actually enjoy my wedding day. She executed all the decor exactly how I envisioned it and added thoughtful touches that made everything look even more beautiful than I imagined. When unexpected things came up (as they always do!), Cynthia handled them with grace and quick thinking, adjusting both the timeline and details seamlessly without ever needing to stress me out. She also managed all communication with the other vendors on the big day, which was a huge load off my shoulders. I didn’t have to worry about a single logistical detail because I knew she had it covered. My family couldn’t stop raving about how wonderful and helpful she was throughout the entire day.

Her attention to detail, creativity, and ability to bring our vision to life exceeded all expectations. From the very beginning, Gisela was organized, responsive, and truly listened to what we wanted. She handled everything seamlessly—coordinating with vendors, managing the timeline, and ensuring every little detail was flawless. One thing that truly impressed us was how thorough she was with the final budget the venue sent over. She caught discrepancies we would have never noticed, got us money back, and even managed to add extra late-night bites within our total budget! On the day of the wedding, I was able to fully enjoy every moment because I knew we were in the best hands. What truly sets Gisela apart is her passion and dedication. She treated our wedding as if it were her own, going the extra mile to ensure everything was beautiful and stress-free.

After years of being the go-to planner in my personal and professional circles, I’m officially launching a new adventure: full service wedding planning and month/day-of wedding coordination! Whether you’re a DIY couple who needs a little backup or you want someone to take the reins on the day-of, I’m here to make it all happen without a hitch. 📍 Serving the San Francisco Bay Area Let’s make some wedding day magic together!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We were so happy with the service provided by Krysta at Happens Like Magic, our wedding coordinator. From the very beginning, I said my part in the planning was done & I was handing it off to her. I wanted to just enjoy and take in all of the moments of my wedding & not be bothered by the details or hiccups. Her communication style was attentive, prompt, and she was easy to communicate with. I only had to explain things once & she took it from there. She was always quick to respond to our questions and keep us updated on the planning process. On the day of the wedding, Krysta’s detail-oriented approach was evident. Any issues that arose were handled completely by the Krysta before I even found out. She was always there, so I never had to go searching for her. Her commitment to ensuring our special day went off without a hitch was greatly appreciated, and we are so glad we didn’t try to do this without her. We highly recommend Happens Like Magic to any couple planning their wedding.”Jessica H., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/e0f05804-d147-424c-88de-523aa36d3db6?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/happens-like-magic)

AWE Planner 5.0

  * Offers 5 services

  * Serves Oakland, CA

As the founder of AWE Planner, you might wonder: How did she become a planner? How many events do we coordinate each year? What inspires us about this work? For founder Jenn Greel, becoming a wedding and event planner was a natural path. Her journey began with bartending private events, and planning gatherings for friends, which eventually spared the idea of launching her own planning business. From our first wedding fair to signing our first client-who happened to be a coworker at the time-AWE Planner was built from scratch. With every event we've learned, grown, and harnessed our experiences to shape the outstanding team we are today.“We were so happy to find AWE Planner to coordinate our wedding reception. Jenn was very communicative and easy to work with, making sure to check in with us leading up to our wedding and helping wrangle all our vendors. She and her assistant, Flor, even came out for several walkthroughs at our venue to make sure every detail was figured out. The icing on the cake was they were also able to create and deliver our floral arrangements, which was a HUGE bonus. Our flowers looked incredible and worked perfectly with our aesthetic. We were able to hand off all of our signage and decor and they put everything together beautifully. If you are having any sort of wedding or event, I would highly recommend hiring AWE Planner to make your vision come to life.”Alyssa R., 8 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/04577c1e-0f04-49b9-a0de-5bfd2f7d2105?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/awe-planner)

She followed up with me every month leading up to the wedding to make sure the planning and vendor bookings were on track and. She also helped a ton with planning the full schedule for the day and had a good sense of how long each thing would take. And on the day-of she put out sooo many fires- unexpected guests showing up, adding an extra reception table, grabbing the vows that I forgot in the car last minute, coordinating with all the vendors.

We are Anna and Lucky, the passionate founders of The Darling Buds , a women-owned, event planning company that's all about turning your special moments into unforgettable memories! At The Darling Buds, we are committed to delivering a service rooted in trust, care, and attention to detail. We understand how meaningful your special moments are, and we treat each one with the respect and dedication it deserves. Your happiness is at the heart of everything we do. Let’s work together to create lasting memories, thoughtfully crafted and beautifully remembered.“We couldn't have asked for better wedding planners than Anna and Lucky! They are incredibly responsible, detail-oriented, and an absolute joy to work with. From the very beginning, they scheduled an initial meeting to understand our love story, our vision for the wedding, our budget, and to walk us through the services they offer at The Darling Buds. After that meeting, they sent over a detailed breakdown of their packages. After thoughtful consideration, we chose the Month-of Coordination package--and it was one of the best decisions we made! In addition to coordination, they helped us build a beautiful and affordable wedding website that included our love story, the wedding agenda, RSVP page, photo gallery, and a link to our registry. They also went above and beyond by helping us create a wedding invitation tailored for our international guests to assist with their visa applications--such a thoughtful touch. One month before the wedding, we had a comprehensive prep meeting to go through every detail of the big day. Anna and Lucky became our main point of contact for all vendor communication, which saved us so much time and stress. As first-time newlyweds, we felt incredibly supported--they thought of every little detail we might have missed. They were punctual and helpful at our rehearsal, offering invaluable tips for ceremony positioning, like where each person should stand and how to coordinate with photographers and videographers to ensure all the right moments were captured. On the wedding day itself, Anna and Lucky truly worked their magic-arranging outdoor dining tables, communicating seamlessly with vendors, and keeping us updated on the schedule to make sure everything went smoothly. We are beyond satisfied with the planning and execution of our wedding thanks to Anna and Lucky. My husband and I had a truly magical day, and we wholeheartedly recommend their services to anyone who is going to plan their wedding!”Joy B., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/faa7cbd0-5119-445a-bc46-73f1b36e87a6?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/the-darling-buds-event-design-planning)

I was born and raised in a beautiful valley in Western Colorado. I prefer living in small towns, but I like visiting big cities and finding all the best restaurants. Even though I spent most of my life in the west, I am enjoying the opportunity of living in new places. Along with event planning, a few other things that I love are my husband, my daughters, dogs (but especially my own), mountains, home improvement projects, camping, thunderstorms, dance parties, any and all dessert, cooking, and wearing the color black.“Kel Bozeman Events was an absolute pleasure to work with for our wedding. From the start, Mikelle demonstrated active listening, respect, and responsiveness, ensuring our vision was brought to life. Her work was commendable, proficient, detailed, and outstanding - she made sure everything went according to plan and timeline, paid close attention to every detail, and handled any stressful situations with excellent communication and calm professionalism.

2 Friends Events was established in 2010 by...2 Friends! Lindsey and I met as co-maids of honor in our friend Wendi's wedding. We loved working together, so we decided to take a chance and start our own event planning company. Lindsay has since retired to be with her family and I now run 2 Friends Events with the help of my amazing team.“There is no question that choosing 2 Friends Events as our wedding planner was the best decision we made throughout the process. (And of course, we made a lot of other smart and delightful decisions thanks to the 2FE team!) From our first call through the week after our wedding, Nichole and her team provided us constant support, seamless logistics and research, and brought so much joy to the planning process. As our planner, Nichole listened, helped keep us focused on what we said was important to us, and was always five steps ahead with her proactivity and organization. And my goodness, did she bring our vision to life! Everything from it being colorful and vibrant to finding an ADA friendly venue to incorporating our dog and favorite beverage Spindrift to herding us all on the wedding day (no strong feat!). Last but not least, each person we interacted with was just kind and a good human being. When we had a family crisis the weeks leading up to the wedding, she immediately helped pull together contingency plans. We couldn’t have been more grateful for everything they did for us. Thank you, Nichole and team! Trust us, you won’t regret choosing 2 Friends Events.”Marie and D., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/2-friends-events)
