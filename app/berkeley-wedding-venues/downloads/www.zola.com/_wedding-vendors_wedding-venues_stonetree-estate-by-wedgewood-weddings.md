•Stephanie S.•Aug 13, 2025

Stonetree Estate by Wedgewood Weddings was an absolute dream to work with for our wedding. From our first interaction, their communication was quick, kind, and helpful, putting us at ease throughout the entire planning process. The venue was simply elegant, beautiful, and timeless - they handled all the setup and takedown of our decorations flawlessly and were great about checking in with us throughout the day to make sure everything was going smoothly. I'll recommend Wedgewood to any couple about to be married - they are wonderful and help make the planning process smooth and painless!

•Ciera S.•May 21, 2025

Stonetree Estate by Wedgewood Weddings provided an absolutely magical experience for our wedding day. From the moment we first spoke with Tianna, their communication was clear, concise, and highly professional. The venue itself is truly breathtaking, with a scenic, spacious layout and an amazing ivy-covered wall that created the perfect backdrop for our photos. Tianna and the Stonetree team ensured we stayed on schedule and were taken care of with delicious food, drinks, and desserts throughout the evening. We cannot thank Tianna enough for going the extra mile to make sure we were happy and our day was perfect. The value Stonetree provided for our wedding was amazing, and we would highly recommend them to any couple looking for a truly special and unforgettable wedding venue.

  * ### Nearly a One-Stop Shop for your Wedding!

•Verified review

•Sarah and J.•Mar 24, 2025

Hannah and Tiana were great to work with throughout our entire planning process. Many friends asked why we were so relaxed throughout the year leading up to our wedding, especially the week and day of. The Stonetree Estate team made it simple: laying out plans, guiding us, and providing clear step-by-step instructions on how to get the most out of our wedding day and how to minimize stress or unexpected moments. The team knocked it out of the park on getting things done, and Hannah especially shined during the wedding day. She kept us on track, on time, and in the right place without feeling pushy, condescending, or rude. She knew when we were having a moment and didn't interrupt, and she was invaluable to both of us, not overly focused on the bride or the groom at any point. All staff/in-house vendors worked well with our outside vendors (photographers, videographers, and florist) and helped them get the most out of the venue. The only downside was we felt the open bar was pouring lightly (I had 5 or 6 Long Island ice teas and only felt a slight buzz). This was commented on by several of our guests, but as far as bad things that could happen on a wedding day, we felt that this didn’t do anything to ruin the mood at the reception, and we’d recommend Stonetree Estate to all of our friends and family. So many friends, families, and even a few of our vendors commented on how happy the entire wedding felt. One of our friends who is getting married in September commented, “This was the perfect wedding. Can we steal your whole idea board?”. So, thanks, Stonetree for making us the cool couple amongst our newly wedded friends!

Stonetree Estate by Wedgewood Weddings was an absolutely amazing venue for our wedding. The communication from the team was consistently clear and helpful throughout the entire planning process. Their attention to detail and organization ensured our day went off without a hitch, and they tended to our every need. The food was top-tier and the customer service from the entire staff was superb. Our family and guests raved about the gorgeous venue and the exceptional service they received. As a DIY bride, I was grateful for the team's assistance with setup as well. I'll forever recommend Stonetree Estate - they truly made our special day extra special.
