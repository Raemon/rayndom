Katelyn Tucker Photography 5.0

  * Photojournalistic style
  * Starts at $3,600 
  * Serves San Ramon, CA

I am an elopement and wedding photographer based in Northern California, who shoots for the fun quirky weirdos who are unabashedly themselves. I capture the perfection that you are while having a laugh and (almost assuredly) crying along while you read your vows. My name is Katelyn and I want to meet you!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We would 1000% percent recommend Katelyn! Choosing a wedding photographer felt daunting, especially since we wanted our day to reflect our unique story—simple, real, and close to nature. The thought of posing for pictures made us both nervous, but Katelyn has a calming presence. We wanted our photos to be genuine, mostly not staged, and Katelyn was the perfect fit. She didn't just take pictures; she captured our essence. And she was so patient, and dedicated, both during the wedding planning and during the day of (in addition to a very nice engagement photo-shoot!). From the get-go, Katelyn was all in. She spent time getting to know us, understanding that we were a bit camera-shy, and scouting out locations to get the best shots. She suggested poses that didn't feel like poses at all—they were just us, being us, with a little guidance. On the day of our wedding, Katelyn navigated our outdoor setting with professionalism. She blended into the background, all while snapping away and capturing our moments—moments we were too caught up in the day to see. Seeing our photos for the first time, we were blown away. They weren't just beautiful, they were authentically us. Katelyn took our quirky traits and tender looks and turned them into art, and captured a great party in amazing detail. There were a few unplanned moments during the party (the Horah, etc), that happened in a blink of an eye, and Katelyn managed to capture them perfectly! For couples looking for a photographer who will understand you and bring out the natural joy in your day, Katelyn is the one!”N M., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/katelyn-tucker-photography)

Also joined by a second photographer at every session, this team can provide twice as many angles of your special day.“Julia truly captured our joy and love. The pictures are stunning - she selected such an incredible set of photos and edited them beautifully! I love the saturated colors in her pictures - it really made the fall wedding vibes seem magical. She also photographed an engagement shoot, which was just as wonderful! I highly recommend Julia for wedding photography. She was easy to work with, and helped us feel more comfortable even though neither of us like being the center of attention. She also came early to both locations to scope out the best spots to take pictures and helped us through the pre-wedding planning process with ease.

I photograph people all over the world and I am a published photographer. I charge $350/hr or $2,800 for 8 hours with a free engagement or boudoir shoot. Add-ons to my packages can include videography and second shooters.

I took one look at her portfolio and knew that she was talented. She made the booking process super easy and was reachable via Email and Text. She formalized the agreement via contract which was very professional and helped me guarantee that she would be committed to my event. On the day of the event, she went above and beyond. She helped calm me as we were running a bit late but she kept things moving the whole event. She captured photos of me, my guests, and got detailed shots of all our decorations. Our guests loved that she offered pointers on how to pose and stand. Not to mention she took several photos of every shot - I’ve worked with photographers in the past who will only take 1 shot, but not Vic! After the event, she gave me all the unedited photos within 48 hours which was a HUGE win! She captured around 700 photos of my 2 hour event - I was stunned in the best way. Overall, working with her was a dream and I cannot wait to hire her for my next event.”Selina S., 9 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/ab7e2925-7cf0-47e0-8538-d4941ccf7278?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/vic-schaefer-photography)

I'm Katherine, a wedding photographer based in Oakland, CA. With over a decade of experience and features in Vogue, Brides, The New York Times, and more, I know how to create wedding photos that don’t just look stunning — they feel like you. No trendy filters, no forced poses, just authentic moments that reflect who you are. I believe the best moments aren’t staged. They unfold naturally, in the quiet glances, the belly laughs, and those unspoken connections shared with your loved ones. My goal is to capture those raw, in-between moments that truly make your wedding day yours!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Working with Katherine Marchand of Weddings by Katherine Marchand was an absolute pleasure from start to finish. Her communication was prompt, funny, and professional throughout the entire process. Katherine's work is highly skilled, incredibly detailed, and provides incredible value.

Katherine was present with us at our city hall wedding and we cannot wait to have her join us for our celebration in Mexico! Katherine is the photographer I would call anytime I need photos taken.

From the very first interaction, EJ & Sarah's communication was exceptional. They made us feel comfortable and confident every step of the way, ensuring that every detail was covered and that our vision was understood. Their organizational skills were impeccable, leaving us stress-free and able to enjoy our big day. On the wedding day, their team was phenomenal.

The candid moments especially, were some of our favorites. When we received the teaser film and the photos, Meredith and I were left speechless. The quality and artistry of their work are beyond words. Every shot, every frame was beautifully, bringing out the emotions and joy of the day in a way that we will cherish forever. Their passion and dedication were clear in every aspect, from the carefully planned photo setups to the spontaneous video moments they were able to capture.

I’m Cherlyn (rhymes with Berlin). So nice to e-meet you! If we met in person and it wasn’t during a pandemic- I would probably hug you! I’m an introvert-extrovert and tend to ramble too much when I get nervous. In emails - I tend to use exclamation points a lot!! (and will agonize over my drafts of emails before sending them because they probably have one too many!!) My aim as your photographer is to provide a memorable experience where you two feel comfortable, taken care of, and get to fully enjoy your wedding day as much as possible with all your guests & loved ones - whether they be in real life or via livestream!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Cherlyn was a dream photographer for my small Santa Clara wedding held at the newly renovated chapel at the clerk-recorder's office. She had experience photographing there before, which was a major reason why I picked her to document my special day, in addition to her documentary-style photography which suited my shy spouse. I wanted someone who would be able to take formal photographs in addition to candids for the courthouse wedding and Chinese dinner to follow, and she more than understood the assignment. She took the time to scope out scenic areas near the office and even stayed for the dinner afterwards. She was a wonderful conversationalist and helped everyone feel at ease. I really treasure all the moments she was able to capture for us.”Jia Lian Y., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/cffc5e95-fa23-4685-afa1-211483f2576a?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/c-wagner-photography-design-llc)

I specialize in weddings, engagements and elopements with a focus on natural, candid moments that reflect the true essence of your day. While working at a wedding photography studio for the past 3 years I've been able to acquire a careers worth of experience through the shooting of over 300 weddings in that time.“My fiancé and I did an engagement photo shoot with Maddie, and had a great experience! She reached out to schedule the time and location, arrived early to scout out the best photo spots, and was super professional throughout. My fiancé and I have never had Professional photos taken, and Maddie was great at guiding us through the process. We love how the photos turned out.”Adrian, 10 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/moments-by-madz)

I'm Hannah, a full time wedding and portrait photographer in Livermore, California. To me, photography is so much more than just hiring another vendor. And that's why you should choose someone you truly love to work with! I believe the real magic happens during the in-between moments – a secret smile shared by the parents; a tearful hug with the maid of honor; a quirky moment with the best man. These memories are far more precious than any staged photo, and these are the memories I want to capture for you on your big day.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Hannah is a joy to work with. She completely understands that success for a team of wedding vendors is achieved by cooperating as a cohesive group and not as disparate individual vendors doing their own thing. Her friendly and optimistic demeanor motivates us all to perform our very best for our mutual clients. And the photos she takes are full of such life, perfectly capturing the spirit of the day - you almost feel like you were there!”Henry K, 6 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/hannah-berglund-photography)

When I’m not documenting life’s beautiful moments, I’m likely in the kitchen testing new recipes, catching up with friends over a dirty martini, cruising with country music turned up, or spending time with my family. Photography isn’t just my work—it’s something I truly love. I feel incredibly grateful to witness and capture so many meaningful stories.“We are so happy we had the opportunity to have Vanessa capture our special day!

I'm a passionate photographer who finds joy in collaborating with creative minds to capture extraordinary moments. By day, I channel my expertise into high-quality construction work, while my artistic pursuits in photography allow me to explore my creativity and connect with others on a profound level.“From start to finish, working with Will was so refreshing. Not only is he incredibly talented, but he also has a truly artistic eye that brings every photo to life. Every single image he delivered was stunning, beautifully composed, full of emotion, and captured with such an authentic feel. What really stood out to us was how effortless and seamless the entire photography process felt. Will has this calm and warm energy that instantly put us (and everyone else) at ease. During the bridesmaids' photoshoot, he created such a fun, relaxed atmosphere - it honestly felt more like hanging out with a friend than posing for pictures! He encouraged us to be ourselves, let loose, and enjoy the moment, and the result was a set of natural, joyful, and candid shots that we’ll cherish forever. It felt like Will was genuinely part of the celebration — laughing with us, hyping us up - you could tell he genuinely loves what he does and was fully present with us in the moment. His enthusiasm was infectious, and it felt like he was celebrating right alongside us, which made the whole experience even more special. He was also incredibly patient and professional throughout the day. Never once did we feel rushed or staged, he took his time to get the right shots while making sure we stayed present and enjoyed the experience. I genuinely cannot recommend Will enough. His talent speaks for itself, but it’s his personality, passion, and dedication that make him truly exceptional. If you’re looking for someone who will not only take beautiful photos but also enhance your wedding day experience, Will is 100% the one. We’d recommend him a million times over!”Rachel T., 6 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/6b687ff9-4c7b-44e8-8fd4-ffe19ccdbac5?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/van-holten-photography)

We used her for not only our engagement photos & wedding but our pregnancy announcement, maternity photos with both my babies, & newborn photos.

Hi, I’m Hayden! With over 300 weddings captured, I take a journalistic approach to photography, documenting authentic moments as they naturally unfold. I shoot with both film and digital to create timeless, heartfelt images that tell your unique love story. With a go-with-the-flow mentality, I will capture moments as they come and turn them into beautiful memories.“Words cannot explain how fantastic Hayden is! His professionalism, positive attitude, and work blew me away! He took wedding photos for me and my husband. The photographer came recommended by our wedding venue, and everything turned out perfect. Our photography package included 2 locations prior to the ceremony/reception venue. Hayden met us at our house to take photos of us getting ready. I did not prepare a list of specific photos I wanted, but Hayden was prepared. He got all the “standard” photos (getting dressed, getting hair/makeup, etc), giving me direction (which I needed as I can be awkward and camera shy). But he was also so excited to try some different shots based on the set up of our housing. We stepped outside to take first look photos… and it was cold, rainy, and windy. Hayden did not bat at eye! He was such a good sport about being in the horrible weather. Then he met us at another location to take more photos in the cold rain and wind. Finally, we made it to the venue. I loved that some photos were candidate, that I was given direction for some photos, and that I was able to bring some ideas that were executed perfectly! He was flexible and accommodating and willing to take creative photos! The photos came out amazing! I would not change a thing!”Mia G., 10 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/0879c813-a0f3-40a2-859a-7fb513f339c4?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/he-photo--2)

My name is Connie and I have been shooting weddings and portraits for over 15years. The goal for me is to give my client an heirloom of their wedding day to pass down to generations to come. As a young kid, I remember staring at my parents black and white wedding photos for a long time. It captivated me. I am very lucky to have those memories and that is what I want for my clients. I love capturing beautiful imagery through posing, beautiful light and when there isn't light, I like to create it. I can be a goof ball capturing the unexpected filled laughter. Come look at my work, and hopefully we can connect.“Connie was so awesome to work with! Leading up to the wedding she was easy to communicate with and always responded to my emails quickly. When my wedding day rolled around she was at the venue on time and got to work. She was patient with everything going on, she had an assistant as well that was great! I told Connie that I was worried about taking pictures because I never considered myself photogenic, she told me not to worry. She did a great job! The pictures turned out beautiful! I love them! Now the hard part is choosing which ones to print.”Stacey and B., 2 years ago![](https://images.zola.com/bb7b67fb-32e6-4ab5-86b0-0d09d0e9be9a?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/connie-leal-photography)

  * Serves San Ramon, CA

Welcome. "I BELIEVE...connection matters. Photos tell our story and carry our legacy. Melanin matters on camera. Every human deserves to be seen. 8 out of 10 humans say they feel awkward in front of the camera; Laughter is the antidote." ​ It is my loud passion to capture the personality of relationship...within couples, families, communities, and even organizations. And I have been this way since I was a kid. With my hot pink camera in tow, 8-year old me would capture the loud joy of my BIG extended family. Little did I know...they were my training ground in photography. And I am happy to say that my approach to photography hasn't changed.“Brandi was amazing to work with! We couldn’t have asked for a better photographer or a better experience! From our first virtual meeting with Brandi we knew that we made the right choice! Brandi has an amazing personality and we could tell right away that she was passionate about not only photography but about people too!! On our wedding day Brandi worked hard to bring our vision to life and exceeded all of our expectations! Our photos were amazing! We have received so many compliments on our photos! We are so thankful that Brandi was a part of our big day! I only wish that we lived closer so that Brandi could capture more of our memories!!”CaShena S., 24 days ago![](https://images.zola.com/1a8871be-c311-4f97-ae93-d0e3c5b66fc9?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/brandi-rollins-photography)

Hey, I'm Diep, the photographer at Warm Heart Photography. Based in Concord, California, I offer service around the Bay Area, and beyond. My goal is to sharpen my skills every day, serve my best, and create happy memories for my clients. Thank you for stopping by. I look forward to meeting you.“We are so happy we chose Warm Heart Photography (Diep) for both our engagement and wedding day photos. For our engagement shoot, she was incredibly friendly, responsive, and was very accommodating--even bringing a quick-change tent! She made sure to capture every shot we wanted from our shot list, and the photos turned out absolutely stunning and ethereal (exactly like we had envisioned). On our wedding day, Warm Heart Photography was equally amazing. Despite the hectic environment, Diep and her second shooter came prepared, was professional and adapted seamlessly to the ever changing environment. They worked hard to get every shot on our list, and the photos turned out beautiful and candid. (There were so many nice shots, that it was hard to choose our favorites!) They did such an amazing job with capturing everything on the day. We didn't have time to soak in everything around us, but with the photos, we were able to relive the day! Diep has a great work ethic and we wouldn't hesitate to refer her to our friends and family. We're so grateful for her talent, dedication, and kindness throughout the entire process. If you're looking for a photographer who truly cares about her clients and will do everything she can to capture your vision, Diep is the one!”Amy C., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/270a8ea8-066d-43ae-ab26-f5abab489cf3?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/warm-heart-photography)

We booked her to take our engagement and wedding photos and we were very happy with the results. Neither of us love getting our photo taken but she made the whole process easy and comfortable. She recommend a bunch of beautiful locations for our engagement shoot that were in our area and worked around our schedule. Our wedding photos were great (even got some with us and our dogs) and she got lots of amazing shots of our guests enjoying themselves. We highly recommend booking Carrie for your special day!
