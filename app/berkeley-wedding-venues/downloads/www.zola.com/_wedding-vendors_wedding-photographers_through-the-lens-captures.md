I have loved photography and have been doing it for over 10 years. Through the lens captures was created in 2019, as I finally decided to establish a business. Through the lens has covered many different types of weddings, but has also been involved in fashion, branding, private events, and sports photography up until this point. My goal is to give you 210% every time. You can depend on me to show up, and show out for your wedding.

I have a background in project management, and I’ve been in your shoes planning my own wedding as well as many family and friends weddings. So I understand all that goes into finding the right vendor. I understand the importance of a wedding photographer and how it can make or break the memories of a very special occasion. You can trust me to deliver you an amazing experience, one that will be detail oriented and tailored to what you’re looking for on your special day.

## Frequently asked questions

4 Answers

Ask them a question

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically, couples book me about 12 months before their wedding date. I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible about my availability, even if you’re planning on a shorter time frame.

### Will you edit all our pictures?

Definitely. All final images will be edited for color, saturation, exposure, and sharpness to ensure they look beautiful.

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

My turnaround time varies by season. Typically, you’ll be able to view your photos online about 4-6 weeks after your wedding. Within this time, you can also expect to receive a online album with high-resolution images, so you can share the photos with your loved ones, they can directly download from, and you can order prints from as well.

### Do you also offer video services?

No, I prefer focusing on photography only, so you can get the best wedding pictures possible. But, I do have a few videographers in my network that I can connect you with for video services.
