Named one of the nation’s top psychics, Eve of Elite Tarot entertains your guests with unique, fun, and above all, professional and positive tarot card readings. Eve's readings are positive, optimistic, and empowering. Rather than fortune telling, readings focus on using energy effectively for optimal success and happiness.

Weddings, while wonderful, can also be stressful. Eve's goal is to be the easiest decision you make. Whether it be for the bridal shower, bachelorette party, cocktail hour or reception, you can expect professionalism and positivity.

**In three words:** Fun, Honest, Positive

Elite Tarot was an absolute pleasure to work with for our clients engagement party. Eve's communication was prompt, detailed, and warm throughout the entire process. The quality of her work was excellent, and she provided services with great care, warmth and skill with our guests. She provided a fun and engaging guest activation that people are still talking about - it was a unique and memorable addition to the evening. I would highly recommend Elite Tarot to any couple looking for top-notch activation extras that will elevate the celebration.

  * ### Eve is a gem! 

•Verified review

•Cicely•Jul 17, 2025

My couple had a unique backstory on how they met and the impact that tarot had on their relationship so I knew we must incorporate a tarot card reader into their wedding festivities. I found Elite Tarot and after speaking to Eve knew she was the one! Communication was prompt and informative and most importantly she was very knowledgable in how her services best fit an event setting. Guests loved it, the couple loved it, and I was so thrilled at her services from start to finish.

  * ### Very special addition to our wedding 

•Verified review

•Sadie J.•Jul 15, 2025

Elite Tarot was a fantastic addition to our wedding day. From the moment we first reached out, the communication with Eve was clear, kind, and she was clearly excited to be a part of our special celebration. Her tarot readings for our guests were truly unique and memorable - our friends and family are still raving about their experiences years later. The value of having Eve there to provide such a special and personal touch was incredible, and we only wish we had more events to hire her for! We are so grateful to have had Elite Tarot as part of our wedding day.

  * ### Excellent tarot card readings for party!

•Verified review

•Katharine M.•Jul 11, 2025

We had the absolute pleasure of working with Elite Tarot for our corporate holiday party, and Eve was a total hit! From the start, she was lovely to work with—super communicative, organized, and made the setup process incredibly easy. Her readings were thoughtful, insightful, and truly resonated with everyone who sat down with her. My team couldn’t stop talking about how much they loved the experience and appreciated how warm and approachable she was. I would 100% hire her again for future events, corporate or personal, because she added such a special, memorable touch to the night!

## Frequently asked questions

5 Answers

Ask them a question

### What set up do you need at events?

Being very portable, I just need a table with 3-4 chairs located in an area where guests can hear their readings. I can help you find an optimal spot for readings at the event, if you are unsure of where to put the tarot table.

### Will the readings be scary?

No. My focus is more of an energy intuitive. As such, there are no bad or good cards, and in fact, some of the scarier-looking cards can actually herald the most positive change.

### What if the event runs overtime?

As I charge by the event, rather than by the hour, you won't have to interrupt the fun to either cut off the line or negotiate an extension.

### How long do the readings take?

Readings tend to be 3-5 minutes in length. I tailor the readings in such a way to insure that the maximum number of guests who want readings, get them and to keep the line moving.

### We are planning a destination wedding. Do you travel?

Absolutely! I do readings coast-to-coast.
