I’m a sucker for a story, especially a love story. Ever since beginning a love affair with photography in Scotland, I’ve worked to capture striking photography for hopeless romantics. From traditional weddings to elopements, I’m game to capture creative and sentimental moments in timeless color.

Sure, I want to deliver some breathtaking images to you after the wedding. Though it's also a central value of mine to bring a sense of calm into your wedding day. My goal is to not have to pester you with questions on the big day, but to help you soak it all up as best I can. And I'll make you look great as you do it!

  * ### Great quality photos, easy to work with

•Verified review

•Denise T.•May 5, 2022

PJ was easy to work with from the beginning. Always quick to respond, efficient emails which told us exactly what the next steps were on his side/what he needed from us/what to expect, all of which I appreciate as a bride trying to keep everything together! All our guests said he was everywhere talking pics, I realized I barely saw him at all! The sign of a good photog-everywhere and nowhere. We just received our photos back and they’re gorgeous! Highly recommend

  * ### We couldn't have asked for a better photographer!

•Verified review

•Jaslyn and K.•Dec 5, 2020

We are so glad we found P.J. from Fits and Stops Photography. From the early planning stages, he was attuned to our needs and photographic wishes. Prior to booking him for the wedding, we did an engagement photo session with him. We were very happy with his professionalism, creativity, and fun personality. He had the photos to us quickly and we were so happy with his work that we booked him for our wedding. He created a custom wedding photo package tailored to our photography needs. We planned a relatively small wedding at a family’s vineyard, but then the global pandemic happened. In the months and weeks leading up to our wedding P.J. was incredibly flexible, understanding, and accommodating. As our plans continued to change weekly and then daily, P.J. remained positive and supportive. Because of the pandemic, we had so many stressors and challenges, but P.J. was never one of them. We knew no matter what we still wanted to be married on our original date and even if no one could attend, we wanted P.J. there to take photos. Literally days before our wedding, we finalized a plan to do an elopement ceremony deep in the forest. It required a long drive to the mountains, a bumpy ride on a dirt road, a hike into the woods, and a short climb to a rocky overlook. Not exactly what P.J. thought he was getting into when we booked him for a vineyard wedding months ago, but he was 100% on board with our new plan and so excited for us. It meant a lot to us to have all his positive energy and enthusiasm with us on our wedding day. Though our wedding did not go as we thought it would when we planned it many months ago, our wedding was beautiful and P.J. did a fantastic job capturing the elopement ceremony. The day after our wedding he sent us a few photos to share with our family and friends sheltering in place around the globe. His photos meant so much to those who were eagerly waiting to gather for our wedding, only to be devastated when we had to alter our plans. Many people commented they felt they were right there with us as they looked through P.J.’s photos. We couldn’t be happier with our photos and our experience working with P.J. We look forward to the day when we can all gather safely in celebration and we hope we can have P.J. there to capture all those special moments with our family and friends.

We love PJ, and have loved getting to know him through our wedding planning process. We now consider him a friend! When we initially started interviewing photographers, my now-husband fell in love with PJ's personality and style almost instantly (I wish I could say that is how he fell in love with me....). PJ shoots with natural lighting so beautifully and upon speaking with him over the phone...we knew he was the right fit for us. We first met PJ in person when we did our engagement shoot in September 2019. He instantly made us feel comfortable and at ease. Our photos turned our natural and were beautifully captured. He seamlessly captured our go-with-the-flow and goofy natures, love of donuts, and love of our East Bay neighborhood. Flash forward a few months....and a worldwide pandemic hits. PJ has been such a grounding force during these last few months as we changed our wedding plans again and again. PJ has been nothing but patient and accommodating for us. We finally decided on a micro-wedding in a private residence. Not going to lie, I was nervous that our photos were going to look meh-meh since our "venue" wasn't fancy. When we got our photos back, I was awe-struck. PJ really worked his magic and made everything look like it came out of a fairytale. Post-ceremony, we arranged for a golden hour newlywed shoot. Let me tell you, PJ will do ANYTHING for the shot. We climbed hills, rocks, and got into bushes. PJ is dedicated to his craft. We can't wait for PJ to come back out to shoot our postponed reception and our future family photos. We feel pretty lucky that we found a photographer we truly love and can't wait to continue to work with.

## Frequently asked questions

5 Answers

Ask them a question

### Do you have insurance?

I do, up to $1,000,000 in liability! Just let me know if your venue requires a certificate of liability, and I’ll send that over to them.

### Do you work with assistants or other photographers?

If you opt for a two photographer package, I call in a second photographer to capture other perspectives, to be in two places at once, or to lend a hand with lighting. I call upon a small circle of other professional wedding photographers that I trust to bring photography skill, great gear, and emotional intelligence. And I tap into the creativity of a local videographer when my couples add video coverage to their package.

### Will you edit all our pictures?

You betcha. I aim for a timeless color look that's high in contrast and preserves natural skin tones.

### How long will it take to deliver our pictures?

I'll usually deliver your photos to you via an online gallery within four weeks of the wedding, and often sooner. Keep in mind that the Wedding Unlimited package includes processing within two weeks of the wedding!

### Do you also offer video services?

Yes indeed. I partner with an experienced videographer that I trust and admire to preserve the motion, sights and sound of your wedding day. Videography services can be added on to any photo package.
