  * ### Couldn’t be happier! Best Elopement Photographer! 

•Verified review•Incentivized review

•Crystal & P.•Dec 28, 2025

We searched and spoke with many photographers because we had a clear vision for our elopement, and it was important that our photographer truly understood it. Once we found Kin Photography, we immediately knew we were in the best hands. His communication style was organized, attentive, down‑to‑earth, and never pushy. He’s just an all around good guy and it was a pleasure working with him at every step of the way. We eloped in the high desert of the Eastern Sierras and wanted someone who could showcase the beauty of the landscape, not just take hundreds of close‑ups of our faces. Kin captured every special moment of our elopement day with incredible efficiency and an eye for detail that far exceeded our expectations. He genuinely understood & was excited about our vision. As someone who often feels awkward in front of a camera, I worried that would show in our photos. Kin eased all of our nerves by offering gentle direction and incorporating fun, creative ideas beyond the typical wedding poses. His passion for his craft is clearly evident, and it shines through in the quality of his work. The turnaround time for our photos was fast. When I saw our wedding photos online, I was speechless. They were stunningly beautiful. Our only challenge now is choosing which photos to print and display because there are so many gorgeous ones to pick from. I’m not sure how we are going to decide. Both sides of our family said the same thing. But that’s a good problem to have! Kin truly went above and beyond our expectations. We highly recommend him to any couple planning their wedding and especially recommend him for elopement couples. We couldn’t be happier with the service and product Kin photography provided. If we ever need a photographer again, there’s no question, we would certainly call Kin.

  * ### I cannot begin to express my gratitude.

•Verified review

•Victoria D.•Nov 23, 2025

Kin Photography was truly the perfect choice for our wedding, and we feel so grateful to have had them capture our day. From the very beginning, their communication style stood out—they were warm, welcoming, and incredibly responsive. Every question we had was answered with patience and clarity, and they made us feel completely at ease throughout the planning process. It felt less like working with a vendor and more like working with a trusted friend who genuinely cared about our experience. On the wedding day, Kin Photography exceeded every expectation. The quality of their work was simply breathtaking—every photo was beautifully composed, with flattering angles that highlighted not just how we looked, but how we felt. They managed to capture the joy, laughter, and emotion of the day in a way that still moves us when we look back at the images. What amazed us most was how they seemed to be everywhere at once, catching every little detail and candid moment without ever feeling intrusive. They went above and beyond in so many ways, even staying later than scheduled to ensure they didn’t miss a single shot. That kind of dedication speaks volumes about their professionalism and passion for what they do. From intimate portraits of us as a couple to heartfelt photos of our family and friends, Kin Photography gave us a collection of memories that we’ll treasure forever. Beyond the photos themselves, they made the entire process comfortable and fun. We never felt awkward in front of the camera—in fact, they made us feel beautiful and confident, which is such a gift on a day when emotions are running high. And then, as if all of that weren’t enough, we were surprised with a custom USB drive containing our photos. It was such a thoughtful and unexpected touch, and it made receiving our images feel even more special. Looking back, we can honestly say that Kin Photography contributed so much to making our wedding day unforgettable. Their talent, kindness, and genuine care shone through in every interaction and every photo. We couldn’t recommend them more highly to any couple searching for a photographer who will not only deliver stunning images but also make the entire experience joyful and seamless.

OMG thank you so much, Victoria! I’m truly grateful you chose me to be your photographer. I looked over your photos again, and I’m still absolutely in love with your wedding! I’m so glad you had such a great experience, that means everything to me!

  * ### Can’t say thank you enough!

•Verified review

•Ariana•Aug 6, 2025

We can’t say enough about Kin–they didn’t just meet expectations, they soared far above them. From start to finish, their dedication, artistry, and care transformed our wedding day into a visual masterpiece. From scouting the perfect lighting to staying late for one last magical shot. Every photo tells a story. The laughter, the tears, the quiet in-between moments—we see them all, beautifully preserved. We’ve looked through our gallery countless times, and each time feels like reliving the day. If you’re searching for someone who will treat your wedding not just as a job, but as a heartfelt collaboration— Kin Photography is the one. Thank you for going above and beyond Kin!!!!

  * ### Professional, Jaw-Dropping Photography

•Verified review

•Andriana E.•Jul 21, 2025

Kin did such an amazing job on our wedding photos. He was very professional, on time, and also just an awesome person to be around on our day that was already so amazing! We would be more than happy to work with him again for big events. He was affordable and included all pictures he took. All of the pictures are absolutely insane and our jaws dropped seeing them. Thank you again so much Kin for capturing our special day so wonderfully!

Ask them a question

### Why should I choose you?

I'm dedicated to my craft and constantly strive for improvement. I aim to capture even better images than what you see on my website. I sincerely appreciate everyone who chooses to work with me, as your support fuels my passion and dreams. I own two cameras, each equipped with dual memory card. After every photoshoot, I perform a double backup to both a hard drive cloud storage. Rest assured, all your files will be retained for at least two years in case you need to retrieve them.

### How long does it take to get all the images?

I offer a 30-day turnaround guarantee, but I can complete your project even faster if needed. For an additional $200, you can choose the express service with a 5-day turnaround.

### Are you insured? What if my venue ask for certificate?

Yes I’m 100% legit and have liability insurance. Will not be any problem if the venue requires certificate.

### Can we get the RAW file?

RAW files are the most valuable assets for any photographer. However, I can provide the RAW files for an additional fee of $300, which includes the cost of USB and shipping.

### Do you accept last-minute appointments?

I would be delighted to work for you whenever my schedule permits.

### Do you charge travel fee?

I do not apply a travel fee for photoshoot bookings of 2 hours or more within the San Francisco Bay Area. For locations outside this area, a reasonable travel fee may apply depending on the distance.

### Will you edit all our pictures?

Definitely. All final images will be edited for color, saturation, exposure, and sharpness to ensure they look beautiful. I also offer retouching services like blemish removal and teeth whitening for an additional charge.

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

My turnaround time guarantee at 30 days

### What’s your back-up plan if you can’t photograph our wedding as planned?

In my 7 years of experience as a lead wedding photographer, I’ve never cancelled a booking. In the very rare event that I’m unable to photograph your wedding, I’ll make sure you’re covered by one of the reliable photographer from my networking . I’ll also make sure they do the same style as me. (Or I will offer an option of full refund)
