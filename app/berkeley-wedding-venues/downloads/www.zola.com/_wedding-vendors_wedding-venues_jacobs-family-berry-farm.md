  * ### Beautiful Venue

•Verified review

•Baylee P.•Jul 25, 2025

The Jacobs Family Berry Farm was an amazing wedding venue that exceeded our expectations. Their communication style was a bit last minute for day of planning, mostly via email and text, but they always responded promptly and kindly. The space itself was absolutely beautiful - a rustic yet elegant barn setting with stunning views of the surrounding berry fields. Denise kept everything running smoothly on the day of our wedding, allowing us to fully enjoy the experience. The value we received for the cost of the venue was incredible, and we would highly recommend Jacobs Family Berry Farm to any couple looking for a unique and memorable wedding location.

  * ### One of my top 5 ! 

•Verified review

•Kymms K.•Jun 12, 2025

Jacobs Family Berry Farm is an exceptional wedding venue that we had the pleasure of working with. Their communication style is hands-on, ensuring a seamless experience from start to finish. The quality of their work is truly impressive - the wedding cake delivery is always stressful but here we feel so at ease. They help set up and meticulously organized the venue, taking the stress out of that process. The staff is always so friendly and welcoming, and the venue itself is impeccably maintained. The new owners have done an incredible job with their renovations, making the space truly top-notch. We highly recommend Jacobs Family Berry Farm to any couples planning their special day.
