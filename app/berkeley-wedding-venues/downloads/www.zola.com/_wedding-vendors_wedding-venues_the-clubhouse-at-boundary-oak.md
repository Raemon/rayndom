We had our wedding at Boundary Oak in May 2024, and I can’t say enough great things about our experience—especially working with Angelique. From our very first tour her professionalism, warmth, and attention to detail were top tier. We toured seven venues before choosing Boundary Oak, and it was the combination of stunning grounds and exceptional customer service that sealed the deal for us. Our initial food tasting was decent—typical wedding food—but a new head chef joined about six months before our wedding. The improvement was noticeable and really elevated our reception meal. Our guests raved about the food! If I had to give any constructive feedback, it would be regarding the bridal suite. While functional, it could definitely benefit from an upgrade. Adding a private bathroom and a lock on the door would make a huge difference in comfort and privacy for the bride on such an important day. Overall, we had a fantastic experience at Boundary Oak and are so grateful to Angelique and the entire team for helping make our day so special!

The Clubhouse at Boundary Oak was an absolute dream venue for our wedding! From the moment we first reached out, the team led by Angelique was amazing - they were punctual in their responses, easy to communicate with, and answered all of our questions thoroughly. On the day of the wedding, they kept the timeline running smoothly and were there to help with our every need. The venue itself is simply beautiful, with a spacious and classy room with windows we wanted that provided the perfect backdrop for our special day. We highly recommend The Clubhouse at Boundary Oak to any couple looking for a stunning wedding venue with an exceptional staff to work with.

The Clubhouse at Boundary Oak was an absolute dream venue for our wedding! From the moment we walked through the doors, Angelique and her team made us feel welcomed and valued. Their communication was quick and responsive, always making sure we had the information we needed. The venue itself was clean, welcoming, and simply beautiful - the perfect backdrop for our special day. On the day of the wedding, Angelique went above and beyond, checking in on me and ensuring my guests felt right at home. She coordinated seamlessly with our vendors, leaving me stress-free to simply enjoy the moment. I can't thank the Clubhouse team enough for making our wedding day a dream come true. I would 100% recommend this venue to any couple looking for an amazing experience.
