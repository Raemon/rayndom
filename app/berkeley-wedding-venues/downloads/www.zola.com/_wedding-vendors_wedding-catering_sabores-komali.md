We’re Cinthya and Maya, a married couple and co-founders of Sabores Komali, a catering company rooted in Mexican tradition and community. Chef Maya was born in Acapulco, Mexico, and has spent the last 25 years infusing her food with warmth, creativity, and cultura. Cinthya, raised in the Bay Area by Mexican immigrant parents, brings a deep love for community to our work. Sabores Komali is a celebration of Mexican identity through food. Named after the comal—a traditional griddle and symbol of home—our work is about more than meals. It’s our way of continuing the tradition of Mexican hospitality; full of love, generosity, and connection.

At Sabores Komali, we bring the warmth of Mexican culture through genuine care, deep cultural pride, and a commitment to making every guest feel seen and celebrated. From the warmth of the comal to the vibrant colors on each plate, our service is infused with tradition, intention, and the joy of sharing something meaningful. This isn’t just catering, it’s a cultural experience rooted in connection, generosity, and the spirit of home.

## Sample catered weddings

  * Samantha & Jose Flores Wedding



The venue was stunning; lush, minimalist, and the perfect backdrop for a beautifully curated food experience. Our setup blended seamlessly into the garden, with vibrant dishes displayed among the plants and small bites circulating throughout the space. The couple was overjoyed, and their guests couldn’t stop raving about the abundance of delicious options. What made this event truly special was the flow: guests could wander, discover, and enjoy food at every turn. Seeing their excitement as they found new bites to try is exactly why we love what we do. If you’re looking for a catering team that brings beauty, abundance, and effortless hospitality to your celebration, we’d be honored to help create a moment just as unforgettable.

  * ### Exceptional Food and Service—Highly Recommend!

•Verified review

•Stefanie L.•Jun 30, 2025

We hired Sabores Komali to cater my mom’s 60th birthday party and couldn’t be happier with the experience. From the start, they were incredibly easy to communicate and organize with, super professional and responsive. The food was so good! We had a mix of small bites and a taco bar. The shrimp ceviche, empanadas, and esquites were all huge hits with our guests. My whole family couldn’t stop talking about how delicious everything was. The taco bar was also delicious, with a variety of toppings and satisfying protein options that really made the meal feel curated to our taste. Everything ran smoothly, and we felt really well taken care of. You can feel the love and care Sabores Komali puts into their food and service. Highly recommend for any special event!

•Verified review

•Caelin•Jun 27, 2025

The team at Sabores Komali helped create a really special space at our event! Their food and presentation are delicious and beautiful & brought a joyful and celebratory vibe to the evening. They worked with me to pick the perfect menu and suggest a range of options that the guests loved. As an event planner it meant a lot to have that support and know that everything would be smooth when working with them. I will definitely definitely work with Sabores Komali again! 100% recommend
