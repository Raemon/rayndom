## **Starting A Return**

If you would like to return an eligible order you have received, head to the Gift Tracker page and select "Return." To request a return on an item you purchased, go to "Orders You've Placed" in your account settings and click "Return" there. Don't have a Zola account? Please email support@zola.com and we can provide you with a prepaid return shipping label for any eligible return.

## **Virtual Exchanges/Returns**

If you are the registrant and someone chooses to purchase a gift for you, Zola will hold a Zola Stored Value for you in the amount of the purchase of that item, plus any applicable taxes and charges. When you request shipment, the Zola Stored Value will be applied to pay for your gift in full no matter the cost of the item at the time of shipping.

Prior to requesting the shipment of your gift, you can retain it as a Zola Stored Value in the original amount and use it to purchase other items on Zola. The purchaser of your gift will not be notified if you retain their gift as a Zola Stored Value. And we will keep track of the gift they originally purchased for you in your Thank You Manager so you can still send an appropriate thank you note.

Zola Stored Value never expires and can be used for any physical product, third-party gift card or experience that Zola sells. Zola Stored Value cannot be redeemed for cash, honeymoon funds or other cash gifts, digital Zola gift cards, Vendor Credits or Vendor Plans, or other cash gifts, nor can it be applied toward items purchased from another website. In addition, Zola Stored Value cannot be retroactively applied to past orders.

## **Restocking Fees**

Returns of some items on Zola may be subject to a restocking fee. Any restocking fees will be deducted from your refund total once we receive your return. To check if your item will be subject to these charges or fees, head over to the product’s description page and select “Shipping & Returns”.

## **Credits and Refunds**

### ** _Registry Orders_**

If you are the registrant and are returning a gift you received from someone else, your refund will be in the form of Zola Stored Value, less any shipping surcharges and/or restocking fees (if applicable). The Zola Stored Value will be placed into your account once your return has been processed and can be redeemed at any time after that. Please note the value of your Zola Stored Value will be for the value that the gift purchaser paid when making the purchase, which may be different from the retail price of the item at any given time.

### **_All Other Orders_**

If you are returning an item you purchased yourself, we will refund your original form of payment, less any shipping surcharges and/or restocking fees (if applicable). Your refund will be issued once your return has been processed.

### **_Possible Charges After Credits and Refunds_**

Once the item(s) are received, the item(s) will be verified and inspected against the expected product(s) and quantity in your return request. If Zola does not receive the expected product(s) and quantity as submitted by you in your return request, or if the item(s) are used or not in the original retail packaging, you will be charged for the previously refunded amount. 

## **Damaged Items and Vendor Defects**

### ** _Damaged Items_**

If an item is damaged upon delivery, please reach out to Zola within 30 days of delivery to ensure that we can get you the proper replacement. If you are the registrant, head to the Gift Tracker page and select "Return" next to the damaged item. You will be prompted to provide a photo of the damaged item and any packaging. If you purchased a gift for one of our registrants, please reach out to support@zola.com with your order number and photos of the damage, and provide an address for where you want the replacement to be sent. If you need assistance creating your return, please email support@zola.com with your order number and photo of the damage.

### **_Defective Items_**

If the item is defective upon arrival or becomes defective within 90 days of delivery, please contact customer service at support@zola.com and provide a photo of any visible defects as well as any information pertaining to the issue, regular care and use, and any possible troubleshooting of the issue. For all other defective items, please refer to the manufacturer’s warranty. 

If you are a registrant and you do not wish to receive a replacement for a damaged or defective item for the item you received as a gift, the value of the item will be issued in Zola Stored Value to your Zola account. Any refunds for purchases made on by a registrant on that registrant’s own behalf will be issued to the original form of payment. If you purchased a gift for one of our registrants and you would like a refund instead of a replacement, you will be refunded to your original form of payment.

## **Shipping and Delivery Issues**

###  _**Lost Packages**_

By default, Zola is a hold registry and we encourage registrants to hold the shipment of their gifts until such a time they are able to receive them. Should a package go missing in transit, please contact customer service at support@zola.com within 21 days of delivery. After 21 days, we may not be able to replace your order.

### _**Curbside Delivery**_

Due to the size and weight of certain items, they will be delivered to you by a local freight carrier. Any charges for this service will be listed on the item’s product description page. Your order will have an estimated arrival date and after your item has shipped from our warehouse, our freight carrier will reach out to you directly to schedule a delivery appointment. For any additional questions regarding this service, please reach out to support@zola.com. Please note that this service is **curbside delivery only** , and it will be up to you to make personal arrangements to get the item into your building or residence. Assembly is not included in this service. Please inspect all curbside delivery orders before signing off on your delivery. If the item is noticeably damaged, you have the option to refuse the delivery or accept it by signing the delivery receipt. Please contact us at support@zola.com if you receive a damaged curbside delivery order or if you refuse your delivery, so that we can assist you.
