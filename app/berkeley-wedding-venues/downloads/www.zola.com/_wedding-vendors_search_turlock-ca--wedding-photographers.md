HRichardson Photography 5.0

  * Editorial style
  * Starts at $1,000 
  * Serves Turlock, CA

I started my photography business with a simple goal in mind: to capture real, authentic moments that tell a love story in the most genuine way possible. Photography has been a passion of mine for years, and weddings quickly became my favorite because of the emotion, joy, and once-in-a-lifetime moments they hold. I love creating a comfortable environment where couples can relax and just be themselves while I document the magic. Every wedding is unique, and I feel honored every time a couple trusts me to preserve their memories.“HRichardson Photography was absolutely wonderful to work with for our daughters birthday. Hanna communicates very well and responds super quick! She puts the most effort into capturing memorable moments. Hanna made my whole family happy and involved, and even made my baby smile and laugh. We were very pleased with her work and attention to detail. If anyone wants photos they'll look back at every single day, she is the person to take them. Hanna made us very happy and delivered our album of photos the next day. I am just in AWE with how great she is - everyone needs photos taken by her!!”Jessica, 5 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/2b44960c-0e58-4e8f-92cd-5f93631ac79a?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/hrichardson-photography)

Specializing in Outdoor Weddings and Elopements! Growing up fishing and hiking at the age of three, I spend as much time as possible outside! Searching out new swimming holes in the summer, traveling to the mountains and along the coast throughout the year! Backpacking, hiking and climbing. Quickly adding more locations to shoot!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Justin really nailed it. He was flexible, easy to reach, and made us feel so comfortable in front of the camera. He has a gift for capturing both the big moments and the little details, and his candid shots feel timeless.

If you’re looking for someone to capture your day perfectly, I couldn’t recommend Justin more.”Rhianna W., 5 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/7359e63d-f770-44a6-8731-ce518cb3a0e9?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/dustin-wheeler-photography)

I was born and raised in the Philippines but now call Northern California my home. I've been a photographer for over a decade and that journey has made me come to realize that nothing makes me happier than making those behind my lens feel amazing about themselves. My goal is to be so much more than your photographer. I'd love for you to consider me your friend especially because we'll be spending a lot of time together on your wedding day. Trust me to help fix any strands of hair that get in your face, straighten out your outfits, help you pose, and encourage you to enjoy this momentous day.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We absolutely loved working with Tooney from our engagement shoot all the way to our wedding day.

I’m Carissa, a California-based wedding photographer specializing in true-to-color editing, candid documentary coverage, and natural, editorial-style portraits. My work focuses on real connection, emotional storytelling, and the in-between moments that define a wedding day. With more than a decade of experience, I photograph weddings with an intentional, relaxed approach that helps couples feel comfortable, authentic, and fully present. My husband, Tyler, joins me as our videographer, bringing the same warm, storytelling-driven style to every celebration.“We had so much fun on our wedding day with Carissa, Tyler, and team. Beyond having a blast taking photos, we felt comfortable and the direction given was so easy to follow. They really make you feel like a model! The photos Carissa gave us hang proudly on many different walls in our home, and the video Tyler made is always something we watch each year on our anniversary.

Northern California wedding photographer inspired by real moments between people who love each other and dreamy lighting. There is nothing I love more than capturing emotion and details in all the magical moments. I want to deliver photos filled with emotion, fun, and laughter. I bring lots of love and energy with me to make you feel comfortable so you can have fun in front of the camera. I work to build a true friendship with you to create trust which aids in gorgeous photos.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Natalie is amazing! I was so thankful to find her relatively last minute before my wedding. She created a very detailed timeline that we used for all of our vendors. Natalie was always quick to respond if I ever had any questions. I was so excited to receive so many photos in our sneak peaks just a few days after the wedding. Natalie and her assistant photographer really captured every moment at my wedding. The turn around time for edits blew me away. I could not recommend her enough! Hopefully soon we will be using her for a family shoot ;)”Nicole B., 4 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/natalie-renee-photography)

HI, I’M HILLARIE HUGHES . I am a lifestyle/wedding photographer based out of Merced, CA. I’m 30 years old, a wife and a mother to four beautiful kids. It's safe to say that I'm a VERY busy mama! You can catch me with my kindle when I’m not editing, and being as active as I can be in my children's lives. Never in a million years did I think that people would love my photos as much as they do, but I am so grateful and so blessed! I am learning more and more every session that I have, and have been incredibly lucky to have such awesome clients (turned into forever friends!) that have been with me during this entire journey.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Hiring Hillarie was the best decision I could have made for my wedding. I had a wedding at a venue she had never been to, and was a little nervous about her not being familiar with the grounds. My nerves were silly because she absolutely killed it. She over delivers and is the sweetest calm in the chaos. I wish I could relive my wedding day over and over, including having her there. I am so happy I went with her.”Catie L., 2 years ago![](https://images.zola.com/2ff8c971-c655-4c02-a09c-4273693777a8?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/hillarie-hughes-photography)

Kate Michelle Photography 5.0

  * Photojournalistic style
  * Starts at $5,490 
  * Serves Turlock, CA

From the moment we begin planning together, my process centers on trust and ease. I believe that beautiful imagery comes not from forced posing or rigid schedules, but from relaxed presence and genuine interaction — the fleeting glances, the laughter between moments, and the quiet exchanges that happen when people feel truly comfortable in front of the camera. Couples often describe my presence as calming, intuitive, and supportive, and I love helping even those with little photography experience feel natural and confident.“It is difficult to put into words how wonderfully Kate captured our wedding. Her professionalism and skill allowed her to take beautiful photos, but her presence and perceptivity guided her camera toward the most important, intimate scenes of the day. We were fortunate enough to have Kate with us for the full wedding weekend, as she got to know our inner circle of closest family and friends. She observed as hundreds of connections were made, countless laughs were shared, and documented the magic in those moments between our guests. Kate guided us through our camera-shyness and instructed us with her expertise on how to pose for photos. She effortlessly wrangled and directed our bridal party and families for a seamless, efficient photo session, somehow keeping us all on schedule. Our wedding was lighthearted and festive at times, as well as deeply sentimental and emotional at other times, and Kate's photos encapsulated all of it.

Hi there! I'm Kelly, and I'm a wedding photographer in Northern California + beyond. I specialize in capturing love, light, and laughter in color. Playful photo sessions mixed with poses that will make you feel like a model make me giddy. I live for the nose crinkle laughter and being there for all my clients' big moments. When I'm not behind the camera, I'm probably trying to find the best chai, hopping in the car for a road trip with my husband and husky, or tackling my every growing stack of books. I'd love to chat with you!“Kelly was a joy to work with for our wedding. Her kindness and attentive nature from beginning to end was wonderful. She listened so well to our vision and captured our day beautifully. She made us both feel so comfortable and relaxed when taking our photos.

I thoroughly enjoy working with passionate, easy going, and family oriented clients. My clients are more than just clients to me. I truly care about them more then just clients. I consider them o be friends who I am emotionally connected with. I want them to be happy with their product just as much as my customer service. I aim to treat them the way I would want to be treated and going above and beyond to make that happen is what I do. Please don't hire me because I may be less expensive than someone else. Hire me because you like my style and because you know I care about you, We all have to make a living, but money isn't everything.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Kevin did the photography for our wedding and it was amazing!

Meet Kathryn: I began my career as a wedding photographer almost 15 years ago, first working for a renowned Bay Area wedding photographer, and then officially opening Kathryn Lewis Photography in 2014. I loved capturing intimate moments, getting (maybe overly) excited about good light, traveling to gorgeous places, and helping set up the perfect timeline and obsessing about the details so clients’ wedding days could be seamless and stress free. Being able to do that for so many amazing clients makes this such a dream. I'd love to meet you!“Kathryn is wonderful! We did our engagement photos with her as well as our wedding photos. She was so easy to work with, never once added to the stress of such an important day and gave us hundreds of beautiful photos. Four years into our marriage and I still have our album bookmarked on my browsers to flip through often. I highly recommend Kathryn for all your photo needs and hope to work with her for every special event in our future. She was flexible, intuitive and never once felt intrusive during our ceremony but managed to capture so many perfect shots.”Jaki & R., 5 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/kathryn-lewis-photography)

For starters, I'm truly just your average woman who is constantly re-watching her favorite shows like Yellowstone + Greys Anatomy - I've got my hair in a bun, cozy sweatpants on and a beer logo boyfriend tee. I'm typically swing dancing in the kitchen to 'CoJo' or cookin' up some bomb ass pizza on the BBQ with my man. I'm originally from the Biggest Little City in Nevada, but I dream of owning a paint horse ranch in the texas, with a big open white and black barn and room for all my dogs! You know the ones we all see on pinterest.... but my new home in Georgia is everything I could have dreamt up and more.](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/mckenna-payne-photo)

As you can tell, sometimes choosing your photographer can be an overwhelming process. There are so many things to consider when narrowing it down to your perfect match. Of course, style and price are the main two, however, some couples forget that your photographer is the one person who is with you the most on your wedding or event day. That is why we offer complementary sessions to all our couples so we get to work together and create a bond. Instead of just being "the photographer" at your event, our goal is to capture beautiful images from your day and leave you with an experience that enhances your memories.“We couldn’t be happier with our experience! From start to finish, Wedding Times Film was an absolute dream to work with. They have an incredible eye for capturing not just moments, but emotions—every smile, tear, and laugh was documented so beautifully. The photos were beyond stunning—timeless, elegant, and so full of life. [Photographer’s Name] has this unique ability to make you feel completely at ease in front of the camera, which truly shines through in the natural and candid shots. Not only were they professional and attentive, but they also brought a calm and joyful energy to our wedding day, which made all the difference. We’ll cherish these photos forever and can’t thank them enough for perfectly capturing one of the most important days of our lives. If you’re looking for a talented, passionate, and reliable photographer, look no further—Wedding Times Film is amazing. Highly recommend!”Malika, a year ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/universers-photography)

Those who aren't afraid to jump when some say don't, run when others walk, and have an obsession with Jalapeño Margaritas are my kinda folks.](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/preserve-studio)

Hi! It’s me, Kyle. My photography journey began back in 2007-2008 while still in high school. I took two semesters of a photography class and loved it. Well then life happened, I decided to join the Air Force where I spent the next 6 years traveling the world but sadly, I did not travel with a camera, and I know not a smart choice. Since then, I have fallen in love with capturing the moments we hold special to us as people. A picture holds a memory that will never go away.](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/kyle-ring-photography)
