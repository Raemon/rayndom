  * ### Great experience!

•Verified review

•Aya H.•Oct 3, 2024

Just planned & went to a bachelorette party there recently! We went later on a Friday night, the music & food & games were soo fun!! I’d definitely recommend all of my friends looking for a venue for something fun! Free parking there is great too

  * ### Baby shower was a SUCCESS! 

•Verified review

•Aerin W.•Oct 3, 2024

I recently threw a surprise baby shower for my friend, the venue seemed like a really good fit on Sunday mornings for this type of event. We had such a good time and I loved their options for N/A drinks for my friend as well, the rest of us got bottomless mimosas & ordered from their brunch menu. The booking process was so easy & fast too!! We had a great time :)

### How much does a round of mini golf and 1-2 Putt cost? How long do they take?

Mini golf is regularly $15 per person and takes around 40-50 minutes to complete. The duration can vary depending on how busy the course is. 1-2 Putt™ is $12 per person, and takes around 20-30 minutes to complete. Games are not included in the price when reserving “Banquet Space” only.

### Do you require a deposit and what is the cancellation policy?

At the time of booking, we require a NON-REFUNDABLE deposit of $20 or 50% of the total reservation cost, whichever is greater. The deposit is non-refundable, but if you do need to reschedule, we will apply the paid deposit to a future event reservation as long as we are notified at least 48 hours in advance of the scheduled reservation.

### Do I need to make a tee time for the golf course if I have a room reservation?

We do this for you at the time of booking! When you book a room, we can set up tee times more than 7 days in advance. If the room is booked at the last minute, tee times will not always be available but we will do what we can to accommodate your group’s request to golf.
