Hi, it's nice to meet you! I am Eszter, Wedding and Portrait Photographer, located in San Francisco Bay Area. Fueled by equal parts of hot chocolate with whipped cream and passion, I spend my days capturing images that make you stop, smile and ask time to please slow down. Life is beautiful, just like your story and your love and I can’t wait to capture it in images you will treasure for years.

I believe in living in the moment and always kissing your loved ones. In images that remind you to see the sunshine in your child’s eye, to feel the love in the touch of your spouse’s hand. I believe in images that have a place in beautiful frames on your walls for years to come.

  * ### Beautiful photos + pleasure to work with!

•Verified review

•Sydnee & M.•Jan 28, 2022

Eszter was incredibly easy to work with, and when I initially reached out to ask if she was available for photos mentioning that we were doing a small and rather non-traditional wedding in the backyard, there was zero judgment. She went with the flow and put my mind at ease that she would work with whatever was in place. I spoke to a number of other photographers who had so many requirements and made it feel like they were doing you a huge favor, whereas Eszter really made us feel like she wanted to be a part of our day and capture each and every moment. Never did she try to sell us expensive add-ons outside of our budget, and she was incredibly responsive. Eszter is such a pleasure to work with, my entire family was thrilled to have her taking photos - she made us all feel at ease. And to top it off, her photos are beautiful! She captures the lighting, the expressions and candid moments, and also helps you pose naturally. I would highly recommend and hope to work with her again for future photos!

  * ### Simply the Best

•Verified review

•Sam Bennett•Jan 27, 2022

There aren't enough nice things I can say about Eszter! She's one of the sweetest and most down to earth photographers in the industry. She's also extremely talented and absolutely loves what she does. Eszter has the ability to put her clients at ease which is extremely important in this line of work, as we all know how stressful weddings can be. You won't regret working with Eszter!

  * ### Eszter is an incredible person, artist and vendor!

•Verified review

•Hannah Berglund•Jan 26, 2022

I have worked with Eszter at a number of weddings and truly cannot recommend her and her photography enough! She has a natural eye for photos and composition, which results in stunning, take your breath away imagery. There are good photographers, and there are great photographers, and Eszter falls into the latter category, with a natural talent that few are born with! She is also extremely reliable, has a great attitude, and works hard to do the best job she is capable of doing. Having Eszter capture your wedding is the best decision you can make!
