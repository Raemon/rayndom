  * ### Hands Down The Best!

•Verified review

•Jillian T.•Jun 4, 2025

Jess was absolutely wonderful! We couldn’t have asked for a more phenomenal, sweet and professional photographer that still made us feel relaxed and beautiful! She is worth double her price! Many of our guests commented on how sweet they (her and her second shooter) were at the wedding and especially loved the final edited photos. I feel like we had a magazine quality shoot. She is incredible!!

  * ### 10/10

•Taelor•May 26, 2025

Jessica was absolutely AMAZING! My finance and I got our engagement photos done by her and they turned out phenomenal. We flew out all the way to San Fran from Texas just to use her! We both don’t really feel comfortable in front of the camera but Jessica made us feel very comfortable and helped position us in photos & they honestly looked very natural in the photos. There was lots of laughing and it was overall an amazing experience. The turn over time to get the photos was super fast! I can’t express how much we love our photos, I honestly cried when I received them. She also gave us a great list of locations to take photos so she definitely knows what she’s doing. She’s great with using natural light and making images look amazing. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!

  * ### INCREDIBLE - can I give Jess 10 stars?

•Verified review

•Cecily•May 25, 2025

Our original wedding was May 2, in Arizona. Due to COVID19, we had to postpone. We decided last weekend to still get married here in San Francisco, and I frantically reached out to photographers on the Knot. I knew immediately when messaging with Jess that she had an awesome, 'let's do this' vibe! She was down to roll with the punches and ambiguity of how the day would play out - it played out perfectly, and in large part due to having Jess there to document. She was so easy to work with, a great presence to take our photos/document the moment, and really make us feel comfortable. She even sent me a sneak peek of a few photos today, the day after, that are absolutely incredible. I cannot recommend Jess enough- any bride and groom are lucky to work with her!

## Frequently asked questions

5 Answers

Ask them a question

### Will you edit all our pictures?

Definitely. All digital final images will be curated and hand edited by me for color, value, saturation, exposure, and sharpness until they come out exactly right. All film images are sent to a film lab I've worked with for almost a decade, with all scans and corrections completed by me.

### How far in advance do you book out?

I take on up to 15 celebrations a year, and open my calendar for bookings 18 months in advance. Timing is personal to each couple, some book in advance, while others are looking closer to their date.

### Will you be the photographer taking the photos day of?

I am always the lead photographer, and I do not outsource my process. For me, this is all about keeping my photos genuine. I'll meet with you, plan out your vision for the day, document your wedding, curate the photos, and hand-edit them to bring your images to life.

### How will we receive our photos? Can we make an album or order prints?

Your final images will be delivered via digital gallery. Within the gallery is an option to directly order custom albums, prints, framed prints, calendars, cards, etc.

### Do you shoot with second photographers?

Yes, a second photographer is already included in each of my collections.
