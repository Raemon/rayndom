  * ### The best!

•Verified review

•Jacob O.•Dec 18, 2025

Events by Dallas was an absolute pleasure to work with for our wedding. From the beginning, their communication was professional and they were easy to collaborate with, listening to our vision and providing helpful guidance. Their team's experience and knowledge was evident in how seamlessly the day unfolded - everything was perfectly timed and they went above and beyond to ensure we were happy at all times. Even after the reception ended, the team helped us with clean-up when they didn't have to, going the extra mile to make sure we could fully enjoy our special day. We are so grateful to Events by Dallas for helping make our wedding day truly unforgettable.

  * ### Stress Free Wedding

•Verified review

•Patricia B.•Dec 18, 2025

From the first time we talked on the phone I knew Dallas wouldn’t let us down. She’s very easy to talk to and you can tell she really cares about making sure your special day goes exactly how you want it to. There were multiple occasions where she was able to calm my nerves down. With all the tools and resources she gave me and my husband, it made the whole wedding planning process so much easier. Once it was time for us to get married, my husband and I had nothing to worry about because we knew Dallas had it covered. Because of her, we were able to enjoy this special time together and I truly can’t thank her enough!

  * ### the BEST wedding experience with Dallas!

•Hannah N.•Dec 1, 2025

Dallas is the absolute best person you could ask for to be by your side throughout the wedding preparation process and the wedding day. She is so thoughtful and creative, and makes any surprise events a “no big deal”, taking care of every little thing at all times. She is so incredibly organized and her planning tools make the preparation so much less stressful. She held my hand through the entire process and was consistently checking in on me to make sure I was doing okay throughout the process. If you are wondering who you not only who you want but who you NEED on your special day, Dallas is the number one choice!

Response from vendor•Dec 1, 2025

Hi sweet friend, Reading this absolutely made my day. Thank you so much for taking the time to share this. It truly means the world to know you felt supported and cared for every step of the way. Walking through your planning journey with you was such an honor — I loved being there for the big things, the tiny things, and every little moment in between. I’m just so grateful you trusted me with such an important chapter in your life. Knowing you felt calm, organized, and held… that’s exactly why I do what I do. Wishing you both so much love and joy as you start this new season together. Very best, Dallas

  * ### 5-Star Review for Our Wedding Coordinator

•Verified review

•Joaquin E.•Nov 25, 2025

We had the absolute pleasure of working with Dallas Events for our wedding in Nevada City on October 18, 2025, and we cannot recommend her highly enough! From our very first meeting, Dallas was organized, attentive, and genuinely invested in making our day perfect. She took the time to understand our vision and brought it to life with incredible attention to detail. Every aspect of the planning process was seamless, and communication was always prompt and reassuring. On the day of the wedding, Dallas handled everything flawlessly. We didn’t have to worry about a single thing—every vendor was coordinated perfectly, and last-minute hiccups were handled with professionalism. If you’re planning a wedding in Nevada City (or anywhere nearby), do yourself a favor and hire Dallas! Thank you again for making our wedding unforgettable! Catherine and Joaquin

Response from vendor•Dec 1, 2025

Hi Catherine and Joaquin, Your words mean so much to me. I loved being part of your Nevada City wedding — the two of you brought such warmth and joy to the whole day. From our first conversation, I could feel how much love and intention you were putting into your celebration, and it was truly an honor to help bring that vision to life. Thank you for trusting me with every detail and for being such wonderful partners throughout the process. Your day was beautiful, and I’m grateful I could help make it feel effortless for you. Wishing you both a lifetime of love and happiness. Very best, Dallas

## Frequently asked questions

6 Answers

Ask them a question

### Will you help with setting up our decorations?

Yes! I’ll set up your decorations on the wedding day to ensure everything aligns with your vision.

### Can you help me with DIY Projects and Signage?

YES! I love creating, crafting, and sourcing your products. See my creations Package, from your bachelorette party to wedding favors, memorial items, and wedding party gifts. If you can get it on Esty, I can make it.

### When should I start this service?

We recommend reaching out and booking right in advance to secure your date and receive the planning tools so you can hit the road running. However, we can book 2-3 months before your wedding if the date is available. This will allow us enough time to finalize details, connect with vendors, and prepare for a seamless wedding day.

### Do you offer event insurance?

I can include event insurance and low cost to meet venue requirements. This package is a lifesaver for couples who want to keep planning costs down but don’t want to worry about logistics on the big day!

### How does the timeline creation work?

We create a detailed timeline covering all aspects of your wedding day, from the ceremony rehearsal to the morning preparations. It includes schedules for hair and makeup, photography, and individual timelines for your wedding party so everyone knows their tasks and locations. ​

### How often can I contact you?

We offer unlimited email and phone support, so you can reach out anytime you need guidance or assistance.
