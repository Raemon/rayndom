Hi, I’m Ebbony – a Bay Area wedding officiant with over 15 years in the industry, from luxury hotels to heartfelt ceremonies. I create warm, modern weddings that feel personal, inclusive, and totally you. Originally from Australia, I support my family’s venue, Bidja Estate, remotely from San Francisco. I’m here to guide you through every step – from vows to paperwork – with heart, humour, and a love of chocolate and spicy margaritas. Serving all couples across the Bay, Sonoma, Napa & beyond.

What sets me apart? I focus on you. Your story, your vibe, your vision. I don’t just show up and read a script – I craft a ceremony that feels personal, intentional, and truly reflective of who you are as a couple. With over 15 years of industry experience, I bring calm, clarity, and a sense of fun to the process. I guide you through every step, from legal logistics to vow support, so you feel confident, connected, and excited walking into your ceremony – not just ready to get married, but to feel every moment of it.

**In three words:** Calm, Collaborative, Confident

Ebbony is a terrific officiant and handled our ceremony so well. Her process and scriptwriting gave us such a sweet and memorable wedding ceremony. Our guests even mentioned how touching and meaningful it was. Thank you so much!
