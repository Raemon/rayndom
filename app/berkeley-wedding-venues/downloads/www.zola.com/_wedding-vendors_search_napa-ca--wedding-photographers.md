Kristen Campbell Photography 5.0

  * Classic style
  * Serves Napa, CA
  * Offer

You don’t have to choose between meaningful portraits and actually spending time with your guests. I photograph weddings for couples who value being present with the people they love, while still making time for portraits together. With thoughtful pacing and smart use of natural light, there’s time for both. My approach blends joyful, editorial-style portraits with candid coverage, guided in a way that feels calm and unobtrusive. Outside of winter weddings, there’s usually more flexibility than couples expect, allowing space for portraits and time to enjoy cocktail hour, dinner, and the moments that matter most.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“From the very beginning, Kristen made us feel comfortable. She was able to take charge when it rained on our wedding day and delayed the ceremony by over an hour. I do not know what we would have done without her!! She kept everyone laughing and relaxed, and for that I cannot thank her enough. Even with the delay, she was able to finish the family pictures, our couples pics, and the wedding party AND still managed to get us to the reception ON TIME! She was absolutely incredible and even our wedding planner was so impressed by her! The pictures turned out to be everything we imagined and more and we cannot recommend her enough to our friends and family.”Briana, 2 years ago![](https://images.zola.com/a7f4bda1-4795-41bc-928c-77d2d8482d16?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/kristen-campbell-photography)

If you would have known me growing up, you would have been surprised if I didn’t become a photographer! I fell in love with photography after spending countless hours in the darkroom. Since 2008, I have been working professionally in the photography industry and have shot over 300 weddings and numerous other assignments in almost every genre of photography. Why Weddings? I love problem solving and puzzles, and I’m always up for a good challenge. For me, a wedding is a day full of all of the things that I love. Its basically a whole day of coming up with solutions to make the best photographs for my couples.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Lisa is fantastic at her craft but also just a lovely person.

Follow me on Instagram *vanessamontanophotography I’m Vanessa—Bay Area born and raised, living my dream under the California sun with a camera always close by. When I’m not documenting life’s beautiful moments, I’m likely in the kitchen testing new recipes, catching up with friends over a dirty martini, cruising with country music turned up, or spending time with my family. Photography isn’t just my work—it’s something I truly love. I feel incredibly grateful to witness and capture so many meaningful stories.“We are so happy we had the opportunity to have Vanessa capture our special day! The quality of her work is exceptional, with beautiful colors and candid moments filled with love. Vanessa constantly checked in to make sure we got the shots we wanted, and went above and beyond to focus on capturing the special interactions between our family and friends. We couldn't be happier with the final photos - they truly helped make our special day even more memorable.”Kennedy M., a month ago![](https://images.zola.com/fd73e18a-e886-4a7f-819f-837485892581?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/vanessa-m-photography)

Amy Little Photography 5.0 Napa, CA

  * Photojournalistic style
  * Starts at $4,000 

I'm Amy, chief picture taker, head editor, dubious web designer, and volunteer animal hugger at Amy Little Photography. Work is always fun because I'm never far from snacks and never close to snakes. Taking pretty pictures is easy. But documenting the honest, emotionally raw, and laugh-out-loud, because you didn't know that happened pictures is where I really shine. Photographing hundreds of weddings has deepened my joy of authentic storytelling. It's also been a catalyst for my cake addiction so I hope you're cool with being an enabler.“When I was looking at photographer portfolios, what I paid attention to most was how they captured candids. Could the joy, love, and excitement of the days shine through? Literally no one could compete with Amy Little there! She has an incredible talent for capturing the sweet moments that make a wedding special. Then I talked to her, and we instantly vibed. She even made my fiance lighten up and feel comfortable -- a herculean task! On top of that, she made us look and feel stunning. She taught us two awkward penguins how to model and let our true selves show on film. I still don't know how she did it! And on the day of, she not only was solving problems like a boss, she turned her creative eye into some jawdroppingly beautiful creative pictures in the rain. She's a genius, and I couldn't be happier with how the photos turned out.”Frannie U., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/1269825c-5294-4701-b9da-3c9d6c6dad5b?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/amy-little-photography)

Hi. It’s Michelle. And I’m a photographer who lets you relive every moment of your wedding. You cried coming down the aisle? Perfect! The best man forgot the rings? Hilarious! Three-hour portrait sessions? No way! Couples (and moms) ask me all the time…“How did you get that shot? I didn’t even see you!” That’s my style… unobtrusive, authentic, exceptional. I truly love what I do and it shows in emotional, meaningful photography. So, give me a ring. I can't wait to hear all about your big day!“We absolutely loved working with Michelle for our wedding. Michelle is so fun and made us feel comfortable in front of the camera from day one! She helped turn our “Covid/backyard” wedding into the most amazing and special day. She captures the most incredible moments and has an unbelievable eye for detail. Our day would not have been the same without her. Her love of “love” is contagious and everyone around her can feel it. Michelle is the absolute best. We cannot recommend her enough. She is so easy to work with and truly makes the wedding planning experience fun and memorable.”Jennie & M., 5 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/michelle-walker-photography)

I'm a San Francisco bay area based wedding photographer. However, I am available for travel anywhere! Passport is ready and willing! Truth: I am slightly obsessed with all things girly, and anything that sparkles. Ok, well, maybe it's not slightly, more like severely. I think it's because I live in a house full of boys; I have an amazing hubby and 3 little men. Shooting weddings and seeing people on their amazing day is my happy place. When I'm shooting your wedding I want it to be so fun and relaxed that you are able to enjoy the process.“Brooke and Laurel photographed our wedding in November 2023 at Casa Real in Pleasanton, CA. We started at 10am and ended around 9pm (a long day!!). Brooke was extremely communicative and detailed oriented through the entire planning process. On the wedding day, Brooke and Laurel were awesome the entire time, guiding us through lighting, poses, and making sure everything was captured. They were also extremely nice, and it was so much fun to work with them. Highly recommend!!”Victor C., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/brooke-beasley-photography)

Loren Hansen Photography 5.0

  * Serves Napa, CA

Welcome. I’ve been a make-up artist, chocolatier, a barista, a pet-sitter, a bartender but I’ve always been “that girl with the camera.” (I’ve also been, “that girl who sleeps on our couch” or “that girl who’s booty I saw in the newspaper” but I digress…). Currently, I base my photography business in Petaluma, CA. I grew up in Sonoma County but in my early 20’s I picked up and moved to Manitoba and that’s where I stayed for many years. Upon my return to CA in 2013 I turned my passion for photography into a career. It’s been a journey to call photography my profession, but I’ve always been a photographer and I’ve always been an artist.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We cannot thank Loren Hasen enough for her outstanding work at our wedding! Loren was incredibly professional, fun, and personable. She seamlessly blended into the background, making it easy to be ourselves without even realizing she was there. The photos Loren took are absolutely stunning. She captured every special moment with skill and creativity, leaving us amazed at the fantastic shots she managed to get. Each photo truly reflects the joy and love of our special day. Loren, your work exceeded our expectations, and we are so grateful for the beautiful memories you've given us. Thank you for being such an integral part of our wedding.

I’m a wine country native and learned the photographic arts from my family. My early travels and studies in the art & humanities opened my horizons to culture and diversity, plus I'm of mixed ethnicity. I really enjoy photographing weddings, because it has influenced me in a variety of unexpected and good ways. Each wedding has their own uniqueness, personality, and beauty.

I am a Mother, Poet and never-ending dog trainer of my 3 spoiled fur babies. I grew up around photography, my grandfather was a photographer and this has always been something I loved to do. I love people and I have a ton of fun working at events. I am always excited to capture these moments for people and proud to share my results afterward. Photographing people and moments over the years is my true calling in life. Gives me great purpose and I really do enjoy it.“Have you ever met someone you just instantly clicked with? That was meeting Mrs. Opal Prince. From our very first conversation, Opal completely understood my vision--and more impressively, she worked with me through every indecisive moment and my very type B planning style. She never once made me feel underprepared or behind; instead, she offered thoughtful suggestions, filled in the blanks when I couldn't quite articulate something, and genuinely partnered with me every step of the way. We first worked with Opal for our engagement session, which I was admittedly nervous about--especially since my fiancé has a five-minute photo stamina at best. Not only did Opal make the experience comfortable and fun, but she even brought in her husband to help manage our wild dog so we could get a mix of shots with and without him. When I say our pup couldn't have been in better hands with someone we had just met-l mean it. The session was full of laughter, reassurance, and ease, even as our dog did his best to cause chaos. And the photos? They were turned around quickly and completely blew us away. I had several people text me photos of our Save the Dates, amazed by amazed by the stunning pictures Opal captured. Those engagement photos will be treasured for the rest of our lives--and then came the wedding... Opal and her partner, Wing, perfectly captured the energy of the day--Wing with my fiancé and his groomsmen, and Opal with me and my bridesmaids. You can truly feel the personality and emotion, which I fully attribute to the energy they bring. Their calming, friendly presence makes it feel like you're just hanging out with a friend--not posing for a camera. Our wedding day brought its fair share of last-minute weather pivots, and while Opal's role was officially a photographer, she effortlessly became so much more. I found myself turning to her again and again, and every time she was there--calmly helping, offering direction, keeping me on track. Though she was not our coordinator, she filled that role in such a natural way, and I am so grateful for her presence on that day. I can't imagine not having Opal or Wing with us for future milestones. They are the kind of photographers who make even the most camera-shy person feel confident and beautiful, offering clear guidance and capturing magic along the way Book Sweetbay Photography!!! You will NOT regret it!”Lexi N., 8 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/5e3fd690-cd6c-4f9a-a11e-bb43adbcc2bf?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/sweetbay-photography)

Welcome! My name is Aryk, I’m a self-taught artist who built my skills from the ground up. My experience in photojournalism and street photography combined with my love of fine art are the foundation of my style. My approach to weddings is that of a documentarian and a witness. My couples are folks who value quality and intimacy, and want their wedding day illustrated with a unique album filled with artful candids, punctuated by breathtaking fine art portraiture.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Aryk is one of a kind. Our wedding was so beautifully captured thanks to them. As a wedding photographer myself, it was important for me to find someone that excelled not just in the technical aspects, but in the overall experience they provide their couples. Aryk always made me and Noah feel comfortable and listened to. They're sensible, communicative, professional, courteous, and always engaged. Always going with the flow, Aryk can adapt to change while still providing excellent results. We appreciated how Aryk's photography method provided us with a one-of-a-kind gallery: a blend of film and digital, all showcasing the genuine emotions I so desperately wanted captured, and in such a beautiful way. Our families and friends are STILL so in awe of the photos we came out with thanks to them.

I have been professionally capturing images for over 10 years. During that time, I built a successful promotional marketing company in Canada, received my MBA in Ireland, and moved to the San Francisco Bay Area with my wife. My favorite part about photography are the stories that are captured, the frozen moments in time that each picture highlights. Over the course of my career, I have been asked to tell thousands of stories. With the ability to operate in the United States, Canada, and Europe, I’m no stranger to traveling for a good story.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Working with Harrison was probably the easiest part of our entire wedding. He built us a custom package for our less than normal wedding, and was super thorough in documenting our details. When we got the photos we loved how he and his second shooter were able to get lots of pictures of our family and friends, while taking some beautiful couple shots of the two of us as fresh newlyweds. You won't regret having him along for your special day!”Deanne & M., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/harrison-boyd-photography)
