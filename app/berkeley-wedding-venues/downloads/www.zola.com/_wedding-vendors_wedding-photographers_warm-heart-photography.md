Hey, I'm Diep, the photographer at Warm Heart Photography. Based in Concord, California, I offer service around the Bay Area, and beyond. My goal is to sharpen my skills every day, serve my best, and create happy memories for my clients. Thank you for stopping by. I look forward to meeting you.

Photography is my passion, my art side. I love shooting outdoor at golden hour and capturing colorful/vibrant/candid moments. Life goes by way too fast; life is unplanned and wild, and I love to capture the moments, so you can treasure them in the future. I want you to look back on your photos years later and I hope they put smiles on your face.

  * ### Wedding photos 

•Verified review

•K.L•Feb 8, 2025

Diep photographed our wedding this past fall, an intimate ceremony with just our immediate family. Despite the day starting off a bit off schedule, Diep worked efficiently from the beginning. She remained calm and caring throughout, making us feel comfortable so we could relax and enjoy the day. Without a wedding party, Diep was often by my side, assisting me during various parts of the day. Her warm presence made me feel cared for, even without a maid of honor. Diep was so easy to work with, and our wedding day felt like we had a friend with us the entire time. Diep captured our wedding day beautifully. The joy we felt really comes through. It was a heartfelt celebration from start to finish with our loved ones. We were basking in happiness, and it shines through in many photos. Thank you so much for encapsulating the romance, joy, and authentic emotions of our day. We will cherish these photos forever.

We are so happy we chose Warm Heart Photography (Diep) for both our engagement and wedding day photos. For our engagement shoot, she was incredibly friendly, responsive, and was very accommodating--even bringing a quick-change tent! She made sure to capture every shot we wanted from our shot list, and the photos turned out absolutely stunning and ethereal (exactly like we had envisioned). On our wedding day, Warm Heart Photography was equally amazing. Despite the hectic environment, Diep and her second shooter came prepared, was professional and adapted seamlessly to the ever changing environment. They worked hard to get every shot on our list, and the photos turned out beautiful and candid. (There were so many nice shots, that it was hard to choose our favorites!) They did such an amazing job with capturing everything on the day. We didn't have time to soak in everything around us, but with the photos, we were able to relive the day! Diep has a great work ethic and we wouldn't hesitate to refer her to our friends and family. We're so grateful for her talent, dedication, and kindness throughout the entire process. If you're looking for a photographer who truly cares about her clients and will do everything she can to capture your vision, Diep is the one!

  * ### The best decision we made for our wedding! 

•Verified review

•Krystal•Dec 25, 2024

We can’t stop looking at our wedding photos—they’re absolutely perfect! Diep captured every single moment so beautifully, and they feel so us. From the big, emotional moments to the tiny little details we didn’t even notice on the day, everything was captured with so much care and creativity. Working with Diep was such a joy. They made us feel so comfortable, like we were just hanging out with a friend who happens to have a camera. They listened to what we wanted, offered great suggestions, and somehow managed to make magic happen every time they clicked the shutter. Our photos don’t just bring back memories—they feel like our wedding day all over again. I honestly can’t imagine having anyone else capture such an important day in our lives. If you’re looking for someone who truly cares and will give you photos you’ll cherish forever, Diep is your person!

  * ### Simply amazing

•Verified review

•Joseph Y.•Aug 7, 2023

We had Diep and her 2nd photographer for our wedding and it was amazing working with her and her 2nd photographer. We had to plan a short wedding and needed to book her only 2 months prior to the wedding but Diep made it a breeze to work through everything with her. She was always responsive and had a positive attitude when I reached out to her with inquiries and questions. On the day of the wedding, I saw how quickly and efficiently her and her 2nd photographer worked through all the photoshoots. Not only that, I was amazed by all the creative ideas they had for us for posing and angles of different shots. Lastly, we recently got the full album from our wedding and we were in awe of her work. Diep, thank you so much for all your hard work on these photos, we will cherish them for the rest of our lives! If we ever need to get photoshoots in the future or have friends and family needing a photoshoot, we'll be sure to recommend your business to them!
