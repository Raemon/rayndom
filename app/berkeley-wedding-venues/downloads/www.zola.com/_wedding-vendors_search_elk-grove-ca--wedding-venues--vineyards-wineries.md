From the moment we started planning, their communication was quick, detailed, and thorough, putting us at ease throughout the process. On the day of, they truly were a well-oiled machine, taking care of everything so we could fully enjoy ourselves. The venue itself is quaint and beautiful, with elegant greenery and landscaping that provided a lovely backdrop for our celebration. The food and wine were amazing - we especially loved the honey almond sparkling wine. Having Paesanos as the on-site caterer was an added bonus. I had a wonderful experience from start to finish, and I would highly recommend Scribner Bend Vineyards to any couple looking for a stunning, stress-free wedding venue.”Kathryn S., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/da88fef7-dc72-49bf-aa35-0d4cb714f9af?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/scribner-bend-vineyards)

“Our wedding was going to be on the smaller side but I still wanted it to be more special than just taking place in a hotel conference room. This was a completely DIY wedding, which I was personally funding, and I was doing my best to keep costs under control without compromising quality. After doing countless hours of research online about weddings and venues, it seemed everything would come with a huge price tag - far beyond my budget. I was worried that the challenges I was facing would be insurmountable and I'd have to settle for less than what I'd dreamed of. I knew I wanted to hold it at a winery, preferably one with beautiful views and perhaps a water feature. Clarksburg, being only 15 minutes from my house, was the region I wanted to explore. After visiting two other wineries in the area - one of which had a less than ideal location and poor customer service, and the other that was nice but WAY out of my price range for a 60-person guestlist - my final visit was to Julietta Winery. One of the owners, Julie, gave us the tour and we were immediately grateful for her attentiveness and input. When she showed us the back barn by the slough, I knew this could be the perfect venue! It was private, had separate but adjacent areas for the ceremony, cocktail hour and reception, plenty of nearby private parking, loads of charm, and was absolutely gorgeous. It was somewhat of a blank slate, but had special features like chandeliers in the barn and fountains throughout the grounds, and with a few added touches it could certainly be a creative bride's dream. Her suggestions, examples and expertise solidified that conclusion. After seeing the private ceremony site, the reception area and the bridal suite, we were invited back to the main building for a tasting. Unlike the other venues we had visited, all of the wines were equally delicious, further settling the decision to get married there. I even joined the wine club that day. Another thing that set Julietta Winery apart was that they allowed me to bring in my own vendors. A lot of places won't do this. Since I was putting 100% of my effort into making this a wonderful event, it was helpful to have this leeway and I was able to choose my DJ, musicians, photographer, "day of coordinator", transportation, baker and caterer. Julie and her staff were so accommodating, and Julie even took on the task of being an additional "day of" coordinator and "calmer of nerves". The wedding turned out to be everything I could have hoped for and more, and every single guest was amazed by the beautiful venue, the quality wine and the service received. It was perfect in every single way. I just wish I could share pictures with this review. We're so grateful to Julietta Winery!”Staci and M., 3 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/julietta-winery)

## About wedding venues in Elk Grove, CA

### 

California offers an incredible 840 miles of coastline, 3,000+ wineries and ancient redwoods for your wedding day. When you choose the Golden State, you're getting exceptional natural lighting for your ceremony across diverse settings from Mediterranean coastal zones to alpine mountain backdrops. Each region has its own distinctive character that can perfectly match your vision.

### What Makes California Wedding Venues So Special?

Northern California's Napa Valley welcomes you with rolling vineyards and Spanish colonial architecture where intimate wine cave ceremonies create unforgettable moments. Head to Southern California and you'll find oceanfront venues like Duke's Malibu where you can exchange vows with the Pacific stretching out behind you while enjoying fresh coastal-inspired cuisine. Palm Springs offers dramatic desert venues with mountain backdrops and striking midcentury modern architecture that photographs beautifully.

### How Much Do Wedding Venues in California Cost?

Wedding venues in California typically run between $9,600 and $11,700 which aligns nicely with the national range of $6,500-$12,000. This represents about 18% of your total wedding budget. Your overall costs will vary based on guest count:

  * 50 guests: $26,190
  * 100 guests: $43,692
  * 150 guests: $60,141
  * 200 guests: $74,836
  * 250 guests: $89,530

Accessibility options have improved greatly across California venues in recent years.

### When Should You Book Your California Wedding Venue?

October leads venue inquiries in California with couples typically booking venues about 13 months (400 days) before their wedding date. If you're dreaming of a Northern California wine country wedding during peak season you'll want to book up to 18 months in advance. Southern California venues offer more flexibility especially during winter months when you can still enjoy beautiful weather while potentially securing better rates.
