My passion for photography and videography all started in a darkroom I built in a closet under the stairs as a high school student. I loved the idea of composing an image within the frame and then watching the photograph materialize like magic before my eyes in the wash of chemicals. When I was 18, my dad bought our family’s first video camera. I was immediately fascinated with the new possibility of capturing moving images, and what I could further create with this tool. Intrigued by all the ways I could retell a story with not only still frames, but though an array of motions and sounds woven together.

I’m Colin Pattison, owner and filmmaker at Featherstone Wedding Films. I film weddings because I believe in the power of marriage, and I have a passion for capturing special moments on film. I’ve helped countless couples create their ideal wedding film for over 10 years. My goal is to capture lasting memories through beautiful, personalized wedding films. From first consultation, to finished film, I’ll be with you every step of the way.“Colin was probably one of the easiest vendors to work with. We chatted on the phone to get to know him, sent him our deposit and that was that! We talked a bit leading up to the wedding, but he and my photographer communicated to get on the same page/ timeline so I didn’t have to stress much about that either. The day of, him and his team were wonderful all day. They themselves were professional, and all his gear was as well. One of the things I appreciated most about Colin was his ability to be everywhere to get footage, but he was secretive about it, so those that are shy on camera didn’t feel pressured. My videos I got were AMAZING. I don’t know how many times we have watched the videos together or how many I’ve watched it alone but, every time feels like the first. It’s beautiful work and truly captured our wedding day and our personalities. We also got raw footage from him that had us cackling. It’s awesome seeing the day again through both the finished product and the raw footage. Thank you Colin for everything. I highly recommend Colin to everyone!!”Aubrey G., 9 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/d109b045-b058-4538-8d42-2fbbe8366a5b?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-videographers/featherstone-wedding-films)
