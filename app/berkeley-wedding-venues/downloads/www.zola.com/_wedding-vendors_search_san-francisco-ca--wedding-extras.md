Festa AI 5.0 San Francisco, CA

  * Gifts and favors
  * Guest book alternatives
  * Starts at $3 

Festa is an AI event coordinator that transforms how modern events are run — starting with weddings. Instead of juggling group chats, spreadsheets, and endless back-and-forth, Festa manages RSVPs, guest questions, and real-time updates directly through text.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We had 180 guests flying in from three different time zones, and I was terrified of missing something. Festa handled everything—flight-delay alerts, last-minute schedule tweaks, even nudging my forgetful cousin to choose a meal option. My phone stayed blissfully quiet because guests just texted Festa whenever they needed an answer. I actually got to enjoy the rehearsal dinner instead of playing cruise director. If you value your sanity, get Festa.”Sofia M., 6 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-extras/festa-ai--2)

*Dearest is not a photo booth. Dearest is a beautifully simple way to gather and preserve memories from weddings, showers, birthdays, retirements, and more. Guests share photos, videos, and heartfelt messages via a personalized QR code—after the event, so they can be fully present. Every package includes a private gallery to view, download, print, or turn into a curated photobook. We also offer printable QR code templates, signage, and display cards on Etsy, with 100% of profits benefiting Vow for Girls, a global movement to end child marriage. More than a guest book, Dearest keeps the joy, love, and laughter alive long after the celebration.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Me and my besties had a girls trip and we took SO MANY memorable photos. Instead of sending, sharing, remembering, etc., it was so easy for each of us to just post the photos to Dearest. Voila! Everything is compiled, organized and shared.

From the first inquiry to the final drop-off, their communication was clear, professional, and responsive. We had an Executive Sprinter Van for the bridal party and a black SUV for family members. Both vehicles arrived early, spotless inside and out, and the chauffeurs were dressed professionally and extremely courteous. Our driver for the Sprinter (I believe his name was Sam) was especially great—he helped the bridal party in and out, managed time perfectly, and even had water bottles ready in the van. What stood out most was how stress-free they made the whole experience. They coordinated directly with our wedding planner for timing and route changes, which took a huge load off our shoulders. If you’re planning a wedding in the Bay Area—especially around San Jose, San Francisco, or Oakland—I’d strongly recommend BNG. They know how to handle weddings and treat everyone like a VIP.”Scarlet W., 6 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-extras/bng-worldwide-chauffeur-services)

Hi! I’m Riz, the calligrapher and artist behind Ellestrations, a Filipina-owned creative studio based in the Bay Area.

Whether you're planning a wedding, a special event, or simply want to elevate your space with a personal touch, I’m here to help bring your vision to life.“I was lucky enough to work with Ellestrations for my wedding. I was doing most things myself and she wanted to help bring my vision of my seating chart to life and with little direction she created a beautiful masterpiece that was more than I could have asked for.

Our reception was on a chartered boat and Jadore Artists was the perfect addition for a cruise around Casco Bay. Our guests loved having their caricatures drawn! We got married four months ago and I was just chatting with one of our guests and she mentioned how much she loves the drawing Jadore created for her and her sister. She even made prints of if for her parents to hang at their house, too. Many guests have mentioned needing to purchase frames because they want to get their caricatures up on their walls as well. If you're looking for something special and memorable to add to your celebration, Jadore Artists is it!”Kaitlin T., a month ago![](https://images.zola.com/5654a3c9-abab-4bb7-8502-b139afd84544?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-extras/jadore-artists)

Our collections are crafted from natural essential oils and premium ingredients, all certified safe by the International Fragrance Association (IFRA)—child-safe, pet-safe, and furniture-safe. Designed for elegance and subtlety, our diffusers transform any space with refined, customizable scenting.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Scenting my clients’ weddings has been a total game changer! The fragrance is never overpowering and quickly masks any lingering venue odors (like food, old carpets, or dated furniture). I even used it for outdoor weddings and guest are always amazed it smells so good. For larger venues or outdoors, I’ve had the RTS team handle setup, while other times I rent and set it up myself (super easy with their step-by-step instructions). To get the most value, I use The Event package for both the ceremony and reception. I start it on a low setting for the ceremony, then move it to the ballroom at the start of cocktail hour—by the time guests arrive, the reception smells amazing. Two spaces beautifully scented for the price of one!”Planner: Eleventh H., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/a0faca03-917a-49c9-9e78-0ee64c5691b2?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-extras/rent-the-scent)
