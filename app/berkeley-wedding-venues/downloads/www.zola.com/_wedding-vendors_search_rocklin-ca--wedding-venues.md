![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We recently had our wedding at Suisun Valley Inn, and overall, it was a beautiful and memorable experience. One of the biggest highlights was being able to use the venue for three full days, which gave us extra time to relax and connect with our bridal party and loved ones. That extended access truly made a difference in how special the weekend felt. However, there were a few challenges that did impact our plans. The event barn, which was a key part of our original vision, was unfortunately not finished in time for our wedding. While we understand this was out of the owner’s control, we were disappointed that we were not refunded the full 2,000 deposit, especially since the change affected nearly every aspect of our day. Additionally, when we arrived, we were surprised to find the vineyard had been plowed without any prior notice. This forced another last-minute adjustment to our setup so we wouldn’t be facing a dirt lot. It would have been really helpful to have been told about that in advance. Despite these hiccups, the venue itself has so much potential and charm, and we did have a lovely wedding. I just hope some of these experiences can help future couples plan better or spark a few improvements from the venue for the future.”Analisa R., 8 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/024bd0c3-3769-4479-be04-a31009a3418e?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/suisun-valley-inn-at-monroe-ranch)

![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“The Winchester Estate by Wedgewood Weddings was an absolute dream come true! From the moment we stepped onto the property, we knew it was the perfect place for our fairytale wedding. The ivy-covered walls, romantic ambiance, and stunning grounds made us feel like we were living inside a storybook. Every detail was beyond what we imagined. Taylor, our coordinator, was incredible from the very start. She kept in constant contact, answered every question, and somehow managed to think of things we didn’t even know we needed. She made us feel so heard and cared for every step of the way, and she even ensured that allergies and personal preferences were handled thoughtfully and seamlessly. When Ben took over on the day of the wedding, everything flowed effortlessly. He kept the timeline running smoothly while making sure we could just enjoy the moment. And then there was Drew — our amazing DJ — who truly brought the party to life. He made our music feel personal, got everyone dancing, and even joined in on the fun himself! He somehow managed to keep the little ones entertained (and contained!) when their lightsaber battle got a bit too enthusiastic — a true hero of the night! The entire staff went above and beyond, dancing along with us, smiling, and adding to the energy of the celebration. It never felt like they were just working an event — they were part of it. Their joy matched ours, and that made the night even more unforgettable. Our wedding at Winchester Estate was everything we dreamed of and more. It was magical, effortless, and filled with love and laughter. We’ll cherish it forever!”Kat P., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/d1835527-87e7-457e-a8d3-6ca9829a4f99?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/winchester-estate-by-wedgewood-weddings)

“Can’t put into words how great our experience with The Chalet Event Center went throughout our entire wedding planning process! They went above and beyond to walk us through what our big day would look like on the property- from ceremony to reception, they executed our vision and made our dream wedding a night to remember. Bosue, you are an amazing host and thank you for helping us have our dream wedding. Not only did you fulfill all of our wishes, you really came through for us when there was going to be a 59% chance of rain. Most brides have so much on their mind, but you reassured me that there would be a back up plan incase of bad weather (something I failed to think of). It’s the little things like this, that I take away from working with a business. They remember the things we may forget! It’s all in the details! The food was amazing on our wedding night, the kitchen killed it! The bar staff were so friendly, welcoming and helped keep our guests happy! The on site staff, Bosue and Roberto ensured our day went smoothly (timing, everything was set up correctly, and guests were attended to when they needed something). I could go on and on, but my favorite thing was that Bosue had the best communication. Throughout all of my planning, he really accommodated all of my requests and was always available from May 2024 (planning stages) to our big day 10/25/2025. The Chalet is a beautiful place to host an event, whether an outdoor ceremony or inside reception- they truly went above and beyond to make our day special. And with that being said, I highly recommend this event space and the staff here. They are a one of a kind team thank you Chalet Team from the bottom of our hearts, you know we will be back for another event! With love, The Parkers”Megan M., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/a95d69d8-d4f0-4143-9a60-18553e496f99?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-chalet-event-center)

The communication with the staff, especially Keilah, Savanna, and Nathalie, was superb - they were always willing to help and very approachable. The venue itself had an elegant, spacious, and calm aura that was great value for the cost. The food prepared by Jeremy and his crew was excellent, and the open bar was overflowing, providing great service throughout the night. The DJs kept the dance floor lively, and the photobooth was a fun addition. The security was also courteous, ensuring our special day went off without a hitch.

“Lake Natoma Inn was the perfect venue for our wedding. From the beginning, their communication was clear, prompt, and easy-going, making the planning process smooth and organized. The space itself was absolutely gorgeous, with beautiful views and a warm, inviting atmosphere. The food was also incredible - our guests raved about how delicious everything was. On the day of the wedding, the entire event ran seamlessly, thanks in large part to the amazing staff. Jackie was by our side throughout the day, anticipating our every need. Justin and Jaxon were also so sweet and helpful, ensuring all of our guests felt welcome. Overall, the incredible value and quality of Lake Natoma Inn made our special day even more perfect. We couldn't have asked for a better venue or team to work with.”Megan H., 7 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/68d3c2c6-5ba1-4fbd-89a3-46c945125b5e?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/lake-natoma-inn)

## About wedding venues in Rocklin, CA

### 

California offers an incredible 840 miles of coastline, 3,000+ wineries and ancient redwoods for your wedding day. When you choose the Golden State, you're getting exceptional natural lighting for your ceremony across diverse settings from Mediterranean coastal zones to alpine mountain backdrops. Each region has its own distinctive character that can perfectly match your vision.

### What Makes California Wedding Venues So Special?

Northern California's Napa Valley welcomes you with rolling vineyards and Spanish colonial architecture where intimate wine cave ceremonies create unforgettable moments. Head to Southern California and you'll find oceanfront venues like Duke's Malibu where you can exchange vows with the Pacific stretching out behind you while enjoying fresh coastal-inspired cuisine. Palm Springs offers dramatic desert venues with mountain backdrops and striking midcentury modern architecture that photographs beautifully.

### How Much Do Wedding Venues in California Cost?

Wedding venues in California typically run between $9,600 and $11,700 which aligns nicely with the national range of $6,500-$12,000. This represents about 18% of your total wedding budget. Your overall costs will vary based on guest count:
