A DJ’s responsibilities usually start well before the music and dancing. This might include sound support for your ceremony, presenting the wedding party, setting up a slide show, or coordinating the bouquet toss. We’ll do all this — then pack the dance floor with the songs you want to hear.

We include an extensive, computer-controlled 16-fixture dance lighting system for no charge with every event that has dancing. We collect no deposit, we allow cancellations up to 1 day before the event with no penalty or fee of any type, and no payment is due until 30 days AFTER the event.

  * ### BIG FUN Thanks to GREAT VIBES!

•Verified review

•Allison M.•Nov 19, 2025

When I got engaged, I reached out to a couple of DJs just to get some quotes but BIG FUN Disc Jockeys immediately won me over by their amazing energy! Paul was the first person I spoke to and he was amazing in understanding exactly what we were looking for and seemed genuinely excited about our day in every conversation! Woody was our DJ assigned to our wedding and he knocked it out of the park! I had a couple of particular ideas about song timing for entrances and special moments and he nailed it all! One of my family members even commented how seamless the transition from the groom’s entrance song was to the bride’s song and thought he remixed it to work so well together! Everyone had an amazing time and I truly believe a big part of it was thanks to Woody for keeping the best vibes with the perfect music! Thank you again Woody!!

  * ### Great service.

We loved working with BIG FUN Disc Jockeys for our wedding! From the first time we spoke with Paul, we knew we were in good hands. His communication style was fun, collaborative, thorough, and friendly - he was an excellent listener and made sure to understand exactly what we wanted for our special day. The quality of his work was top-notch - the sound was perfect, he played all the songs we requested, and mixed them seamlessly. Even our guests with sensitive ears had a blast dancing the night away. Paul personalized our playlist, was friendly and helpful throughout, and really contributed to making our wedding day run perfectly. We are thrilled by how the music and sound turned out, and highly recommend BIG FUN Disc Jockeys to any couple looking for a fun, professional DJ for their wedding.

•Nikki Q.•Apr 27, 2025

BIG FUN Disc Jockeys was a fantastic choice for our wedding entertainment. Specifically Paul, our DJ, was amazing. From our initial inquiry, he was incredibly effective, communicative and detailed in his process. He put us at ease throughout the planning process. Day of the wedding, his energy was magnetic and made the day so special. He kept our dance floor packed all night. We received so many compliments from our guests on the great music selection seamless flow of the evening. We couldn't have asked for a better DJ to make our wedding celebration so memorable.

## Frequently asked questions

6 Answers

Ask them a question

### Will you play songs that we specify?

Absolutely! This is your wedding and we want the music to reflect your musical tastes...perfectly. During your one-on-one planning meeting with the BIG FUN DJ assigned to your event, music will be discussed extensively. And, any music that we don't already own in our extensive library, we will purchase...at our expense!

### Do you provide equipment and service for wedding ceremonies and cocktail receptions?

Yes! For Saturday weddings April through October, the extra equipment and service to support your ceremony and/or cocktail hour is included. For any other day, it is just $200 extra. And we do ceremonies the -right- way: hidden microphones planted on the Officiant and the Couple for impressive voice amplification, and microphones for readers or musicians are included. Stereo speakers, too!

### Are you fully insured?

Yes - we carry policies for all types of insurance: liability, workers compensation, commercial auto, and more.

### How early do you come to set up?

We arrive 1 to 2 hours prior to the event to set up. You are never charged for this time.

### Do you provide other services, such as lighting or video projection?

We include an incredible dance lighting system (see the videos in our Zola listing) : 16 computer-controlled lights that match the mood and tempo of the music being played. This lighting is included at no charge! We also offer uplighting starting at $500, and video projection (to show your slide show) at $300.

### What business policies make you different from other DJ companies?

We collect no deposit, and no payment of any type is due until 30 days AFTER your wedding. Plus, we allow hassle-free cancellations up to 1 day before the event with no fee of any type. Think about how committed we are to doing a great job since we get no money until after the event, and compare that to DJs who collect all of your money before they've provided any service.
