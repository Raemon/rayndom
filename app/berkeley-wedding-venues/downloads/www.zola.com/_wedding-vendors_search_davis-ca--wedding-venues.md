Desde el primer día que fuimos a conocer las instalaciones, el señor Gary fue muy atento y respetuoso, contestó a todas nuestras dudas. Tal vez nuestro evento fue algo fuera de lo común, a diferencia de los eventos de boda que se organizan aquí, nosotros contratamos el granero para el 25 de Diciembre para celebrar los 15 años de mi hija , sabemos que son días festivos donde la gente está con su familia , más sin embargo recibimos todo su apoyo para que el evento se hiciera realidad en este día tan especial , puedo decirles que fue una experiencia maravillosa, fue en evento de ensueño y de igual manera nos hospedamos en la casa, donde realmente nos sentimos como en nuestro hogar , sinceramente todas las instalaciones estuvieron limpias en todo momento, Gary estuvo al pendiente de si necesitábamos algo y al igual si la empresa que contratamos para la planeación necesitaban apoyo. Quiero animar a todos los papás que deseen hacerle su quinceañera a su hija, que consideren contratar los servicios de Suisun Valley Inn, ya que harán que su hija viva una experiencia única y de ensueño, no se arrepentirán. Sr Gary agradezco todas sus atenciones y muy pronto estaremos trabajando con usted para los 15 años de mi otra hija… Bendiciones”Fabiola M., 22 days ago![](https://images.zola.com/0dbc73ce-706c-4f4e-8b41-7324823426c8?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/suisun-valley-inn-at-monroe-ranch)

![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“The Winchester Estate by Wedgewood Weddings was an absolute dream come true! From the moment we stepped onto the property, we knew it was the perfect place for our fairytale wedding. The ivy-covered walls, romantic ambiance, and stunning grounds made us feel like we were living inside a storybook. Every detail was beyond what we imagined. Taylor, our coordinator, was incredible from the very start. She kept in constant contact, answered every question, and somehow managed to think of things we didn’t even know we needed. She made us feel so heard and cared for every step of the way, and she even ensured that allergies and personal preferences were handled thoughtfully and seamlessly. When Ben took over on the day of the wedding, everything flowed effortlessly. He kept the timeline running smoothly while making sure we could just enjoy the moment. And then there was Drew — our amazing DJ — who truly brought the party to life. He made our music feel personal, got everyone dancing, and even joined in on the fun himself! He somehow managed to keep the little ones entertained (and contained!) when their lightsaber battle got a bit too enthusiastic — a true hero of the night! The entire staff went above and beyond, dancing along with us, smiling, and adding to the energy of the celebration. It never felt like they were just working an event — they were part of it. Their joy matched ours, and that made the night even more unforgettable. Our wedding at Winchester Estate was everything we dreamed of and more. It was magical, effortless, and filled with love and laughter. We’ll cherish it forever!”Kat P., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/d1835527-87e7-457e-a8d3-6ca9829a4f99?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/winchester-estate-by-wedgewood-weddings)

The Ranch itself is stunning from every angle, and really feels like a magical place to be married. We had our rehearsal dinner there on Friday night, and it was so special to spend the whole weekend at the Ranch and have time to enjoy the lovely property (this is super rare for wedding venues!). The owner, Rachel, was an absolute pleasure to work with. She offers a friendly, personal touch, and flexibility in customizing your wedding day that is truly unique! Throughout the entire process she was professional, organized, quick to respond, and incredibly helpful. We used all her preferred vendors and they did an amazing job.

## About wedding venues in Davis, CA

### 

California offers an incredible 840 miles of coastline, 3,000+ wineries and ancient redwoods for your wedding day. When you choose the Golden State, you're getting exceptional natural lighting for your ceremony across diverse settings from Mediterranean coastal zones to alpine mountain backdrops. Each region has its own distinctive character that can perfectly match your vision.

### What Makes California Wedding Venues So Special?

Northern California's Napa Valley welcomes you with rolling vineyards and Spanish colonial architecture where intimate wine cave ceremonies create unforgettable moments. Head to Southern California and you'll find oceanfront venues like Duke's Malibu where you can exchange vows with the Pacific stretching out behind you while enjoying fresh coastal-inspired cuisine. Palm Springs offers dramatic desert venues with mountain backdrops and striking midcentury modern architecture that photographs beautifully.

### How Much Do Wedding Venues in California Cost?

Wedding venues in California typically run between $9,600 and $11,700 which aligns nicely with the national range of $6,500-$12,000. This represents about 18% of your total wedding budget. Your overall costs will vary based on guest count:
