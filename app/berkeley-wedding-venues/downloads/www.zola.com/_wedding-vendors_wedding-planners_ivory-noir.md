  * ### Bride 

•Verified review

•Liz S.•Oct 2, 2025

From the moment we first connected with Ivory Noir, we knew we were in excellent hands. Her communication style is organized, calm, and incredibly creative. She was truly resourceful and supportive throughout the entire planning process. The quality of her work was nothing short of professional and flawless. She was thorough, seamless, and so resourceful in bringing our vision to life. Ivory Noir’s attention to detail was remarkable. She brought our beach ceremony to life by arranging all of the rentals and guiding us through the walkthrough with such care and ease. The setting was absolutely stunning, and she thought of every detail to make it feel effortless for us. Her floral arrangements were simply incredible, adding so much beauty and charm to the space. We felt completely supported by Ivory Noir throughout the process, and her work made our day feel even more memorable and meaningful. I would highly recommend Ivory Noir to anyone planning their wedding. She has a true gift for organization, creativity, and bringing a vision to life in a way that feels seamless and stress-free. Beyond her incredible eye for design and detail, she is such a calming and supportive presence, which makes all the difference on a busy wedding day. Working with Ivory Noir was one of the best decisions we made, and I know she would make any couple feel just as cared for and confident as we did.

  * ### Amazing Day of Coordinator Experience 

•Verified review

•Christy G.•Sep 9, 2025

Ivory Noir was an exceptional wedding planning team to work with. From the beginning, their communication style was clear, direct, and enthusiastic. They were incredibly detail-oriented, organized, and helpful throughout the entire planning process. Dee, our main point of contact, was instrumental in ensuring our wedding ceremony was seamless. She coordinated with all of our vendors and set up the ceremony space exactly as we had envisioned, and was consistently patient and responsive, always putting our needs and interests first. Dee also asked thoughtful questions that helped us consider important details we may have overlooked. We are so grateful for Ivory Noir's exceptional service and would highly recommend them to any couple planning their dream wedding.

  * ### Dedicated & Detailed

•Verified review

•Linda G.•Jul 3, 2025

Even though my partner and I had a courthouse wedding, Dee made it feel like we went all out. Her ability to emphasize the small details for the big moments is incredible! She was patient, fully engaged, and made us feel more like close friends than a 'just' client.

  * ### Great Planner, Felt Natural

•Verified review

•Roland B.•Jul 3, 2025

We knew we made the right choice in hiring Dee as our day-of-coordinator when she asked questions about our support system rather than focusing on our budget. You'll get genuine support and all the attention to detail you need to enjoy your wedding. Highly recommend.

## Frequently asked questions

5 Answers

Ask them a question

### Do you take on multiple weddings in a day or weekend?

To ensure each couple receives full attention and care, reservations are carefully planned so that we do not take on more than one wedding per day or weekend.

### Do you also plan other events, like showers or rehearsal dinners?

Absolutely! We love helping people celebrate life’s big (and little) moments. From birthdays, anniversaries, to pre-wedding get-togethers; we're here to make it feel meaningful and unapologetically fun.

### How involved will we be in the planning process?

The level of our collaboration depends on the services you select. Once you're onboarded, you'll receive a clear outline of how we communicate and what you can expect throughout the process.

### What’s your style, and how do you help express our style?

Our aesthetic blends classic elegance with modern sensibility, we have a love for warm, earthy tones. With a background in human-centered design, we begin by uncovering the unique details that light our clients up; their utopic visions, personal joys, and meaningful nuances. That understanding becomes the foundation from which we thoughtfully shape each experience.

### Do you travel for destination weddings or events?

Yes! Wherever your story unfolds, we're happy to meet you there. As long as the timing lines up, we can travel to help bring your dream day to life.
