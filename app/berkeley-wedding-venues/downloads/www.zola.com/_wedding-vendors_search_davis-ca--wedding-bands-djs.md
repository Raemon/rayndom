I gave them my play list plus asked to add similar songs and the end result of the music was exactly what i hoped for. My reception did not go as a planned and several things were moved at the last minute. Daniel helped calm me down, changed the schedule/flow if events. Although, I know that things were completely different than the original plan I dont think my guests did. He saved my special day and for that i will forever be greatful.”Rebekah and J., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/dj-and-party-planning-services)

The Celebration DJ 5.0

  * DJ
  * Starts at $1,400 
  * Serves Davis, CA

I’ve been playing weddings for over twelve years and I love my work! My services cover any or all aspects of wedding & receptions. I have found my life’s artistic calling in becoming flexible to every type of music my clients could desire. I learn to enjoy whatever my clients love and this resonance makes my job sustainable and ever-enjoyable. But, I do tend to request the ability to make choices for the dance-floor that rely on my years of dance-enhancing experience. I meet with my clients to determine what music they would love to hear and what music they do NOT want to hear.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We were incredibly fortunate to have Brandon Bosch from The Celebration DJ at our wedding. His meticulous preparation and professionalism before the event ensured everything ran smoothly. Brandon's ability to keep us on schedule was invaluable, and his flexibility allowed us to effortlessly include an additional speaker during the speeches. The bundle package he provided was fantastic and truly enhanced our venue. The photobooth was a massive hit with our guests, and the sound quality of his equipment was flawless. Brandon's exceptional service made our wedding day perfect, and we highly recommend him for any special occasion!”Katerina M., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/b1ce8954-d59c-4953-8a07-7715715a8052?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/the-celebration-dj)

Golden Bell offers a unique musical blend that packs a high-energy punch! The DJ/live fusion band, or DJ/live band hybrid, is always anchored on a DJ set but supported by live musicians. With all the energy and hype of a live band and the flexibility of a DJ, you won’t have to decide between hiring a band or a DJ for your next event or wedding.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Golden Bell Music was worth EVERY penny AND MORE! It's been 6 months since my wedding and I'm STILL getting comments on how much fun all our guests had! Even my mother-in-law who doesn't dance did NOT sit down! I'm Lebanese and my husband is Israeli, so I had asked for help mixing songs to combine our cultures and then move into more western music. I'm still getting sooooo many compliments from our families on how we were able to combine our traditions and our music! And our guests LOST IT when they came out on the dance floor with their instruments and danced with us! I did this in lieu of a zaffet group because i wanted something more unique -- in lebanon a drumline would follow the bride and groom and dance/perform for guests -- and it was definitely the right choice!!! On top of their amazing performance, Marlon was **insanely helpful** both leading up to the day and on the day. I didn't have a wedding planner and was making last minute decisions/timeline changes myself the day of. I couldn't have done it so smoothly without Marlon being so helpful as an MC and being so willing to roll with it! He was absolutely fantastic!! Cut your budget wherever you can to make sure you can hire them. It's SO worth it! Thank you Golden Bell Music for making it the best day of summer (so i've been told. multiple times. by different guests.)!! I don't know for what occasion, but I'm 100% going to find a reason to hire them again.”Monique G., 24 days ago![](https://images.zola.com/38e00d33-8b3e-430d-b583-9b3b95d659ae?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/golden-bell-music)

Joey is a true professional on all levels! From start to finish, communication was effortless and always on point. He even assisted us with setting up and dialing in the sound system. Now on to the important stuff... Cello Joe's performance bridged the spectrum of family and friends present for our wedding. It was such a magical experience seeing so many loved ones getting down to veggie maniac, bike girl and so much love :). Cello Joe delivered a performance that brought joy and smiles to everyone's experience. Overall I rate our experience 11/11. It was an honor to have such a talented musician perform and such a fun character to hang out with the rest of the event. Cello Joe's set was the musical highlight of our wedding.

Leading up to the wedding, she was super helpful in guiding us through the steps to set up playlists and coordinate the intros/outros of the bridal party. Our wedding was spread out over a large property, and she had zero issue running speakers to each area, providing a festive, cozy atmosphere! We had a couple live performances and she was very accommodating in getting mic stands and cables all ready to go. Then the DANCING began! Lights, speakers, the whole deal - Ashley killed it! We leaned into more 70’s and 80’s music, and Ashley completely understood the assignment. Needless to say, the music mix was brilliant. Since then, we have had at least a dozen of our friends and family tell us that this was the most fun they have ever had at a wedding. I have no doubt that Ashley is 99.99% responsible for that. Hiring Ashley and Fog City Entertainment made a lot of sense 6 months ago, but now, having seen what she can do for a wedding’s atmosphere and dance floor, it’s a no-brainer.
