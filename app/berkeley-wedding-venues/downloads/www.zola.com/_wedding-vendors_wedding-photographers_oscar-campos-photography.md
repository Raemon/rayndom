Photography is my passion that was passed down by my grandparents. They both loved to photograph our family, family events, and vacations. Unfortunately they both have passed away and are now in Heaven, but they have left us with their photographs of our past and everlasting memories of them that we cherish.

I am very easy going and a people person. I love making new friends and aim to please. I will work hard to capture your day, as beautiful as it is. Being bilingual also helps, I am completely fluent in both English and Español. Muchas gracias y es mi placer servirte!

  * ### Best photographer

•Verified review

•Elizabeth & A.•Aug 22, 2020

Oscar was so wonderful! He made our special day perfect. When you’re feeling stressed and overwhelmed he stays so calm and is so patient! I would book him again & again.

  * ### One of the only photographers who use real film!

•Verified review

•Cadi & R.•Aug 18, 2020

In a world where everything is digital around us, he uses real film! This helped make our photos for our wedding truly memorable. Since he uses film He would take his time and direct us perfectly to make every shot exactly how we wanted. He was friendly, and helped make us laugh without even trying. He had ideas for poses that we didn’t know or couldn’t even imagine! I expected to wait months for the film to be developed but it was developed quickly and he stayed in contact with us though out the process. It was a truly amazing experience all around and will use Oscar again in the future without a doubt!

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically, couples book me about 8 months before their wedding date. I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible about my availability, even if you’re planning on a shorter time frame.

### Will you edit all our pictures?

Definitely. All final images will be edited for color, saturation, exposure, and sharpness to ensure they look beautiful.

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

My turnaround time varies by season. Typically, you’ll be able to view your photos online about 4-6 weeks after your wedding.

### How many pictures will we get?

You can expect about 60 to 80 images per hour of photographing. But keep in mind this estimate varies depending on your wedding package, number of guests, venue type, and other factors.
