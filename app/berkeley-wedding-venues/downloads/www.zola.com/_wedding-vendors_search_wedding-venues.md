Baker's Ranch provides an all inclusive experience from start to finish with their lovely staff and made it so easy. The venue itself if beautiful and has a lot of variety and photo backdrop magic. They were very communicative and professional throughout the whole process. You can have design sessions and they can bring whatever vision you have for your special day to life. I'm so glad I got married here.”Jackie Y., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/99f15ad1-52e8-4c89-9993-1f1ee9a8faf3?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/bakers-ranch-florida-s-premier-all-inclusive-venue)

![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Our wedding here was everything we could have dreamed of and more. Everyone kept talking about how amazing all the staff was!! Our day of coordinator, Kaylie, was so helpful and worked so hard to help us every step of the way. The venue (Terraview) was breathtaking, the food and cake were delicious, and the lodging was perfect!! It was so great to have our close friends and family all staying together on site. This venue is amazing because there are so many things on site: the rehearsal and rehearsal dinner the day before, the bridal studio for hair, the florals, and the bakery! I’m so thankful I also had a bridal assistant the day of (which I didn’t even know I would get!!), I had a very heavy veil and we had a lot of issues trying to get it to stay in my hair, and she was able to get it to stay!! The staff all made sure we had plenty of food and drinks and were so attentive. You get so much bang for your buck here. We had an absolutely amazing time and could not recommend this venue enough!”Heather W., 6 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/30191e7c-2408-4aad-ad22-f1cd17584f27?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/stroudsmoor-country-inn)

From the beginning, she was super attentive, supportive, and always happy to help with anything we needed. It really felt like she was in our corner the whole time, which made the whole planning process way less stressful. On the wedding day, she was there to answer any questions and keep things running smoothly. I could tell she was a little stressed, however she still showed up for us. She stayed calm, helpful, and made sure everything went as planned. If I had one small complaint, it’s that we didn’t get the top of our cake saved—we were hoping to freeze it for our anniversary. Not a huge deal, but it would’ve been a nice touch. Overall though, Melissa was awesome and we’re so grateful for everything she did. Would definitely recommend her to anyone looking for someone kind, organized, and genuinely invested in making your day special.”D’Ovionne D., 7 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/add7d526-746f-4a79-a3c8-ae8e9d0ad719?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-milestone-mansion-denton)

From the moment we toured, the entire team made us feel genuinely special—like our day mattered just as much to them as it did to us. They consistently go above and beyond to create an incredible, seamless experience. The space itself is absolutely beautiful, but what truly elevated our day was our day-of coordinator, Trinity. She was amazing—calm, organized, thoughtful, and always one step ahead. Trinity handled every detail with so much care that we were able to be fully present and enjoy every moment without stress. Her kindness and professionalism made us feel so supported from start to finish.

Lexie was with us every step of the way, from the planning process and being there for day-of coordination, and made the entire process feel seamless and stress-free. One of the biggest benefits of working with Saphire Event Group is how much they offer in-house. They provided our food, event space setup (like chairs), linens, silverware, glassware, alcohol, and more.

From the moment we booked our date, the planning process was made seamless and actually enjoyable thanks to the incredible built-in planning team, Kalila and Ally. Having coordinators included in the cost of the venue was such a valuable bonus, and they truly made all the difference. Kalila and Ally were there with us every step of the way, staying on top of every detail for our 18-month engagement/wedding planning journey. They reached out to vendors, followed up on our behalf when needed, and offered spot-on recommendations that perfectly suited our vision and budget. Their guidance and expertise helped us make the best choices, and their input kept us calm and organized. On top of their professionalism, they were so down-to-earth and fun to work with, bringing energy and laughter to every planning session and making the entire experience even more memorable. One of the highlights was the collaborative online planning tool we had access to as part of booking Walden. It kept everything organized in one place, allowing us to easily stay in touch with our planners, track tasks, and manage finances and contracts. It was loaded with helpful resources, making planning a breeze. Walden provided us with much more than a beautiful venue. They gave us an incredible planning experience and an amazing team that felt like family by the time the wedding arrived. The entire wedding party and all the family members who were there the entire day of the wedding had nothing but amazing things to say too...they were all shocked at how much support we had throughout the entire day to the point where we did not have to lift a finger. And don't even get us started on the food and bar...we've never been complimented more in our lives. We were shocked at how insanely good the food and drinks were at our tasting party months before the wedding, but we were curious if it would live up to the hype on our actual wedding day where we had 216 guests. It might've been even better on our wedding day! Guests were raving about our food and drinks. We were told by nearly every guest that it was the best food they've ever had at a wedding, bar none. We even had sober people come up to us and go on and on about how amazing even the mocktails were. The only thing we regret is being too excited and not having enough of an appetite to truly enjoy dinner as the bride and groom. But even so, our planning team made sure the servers packaged up our entrees so we could take them home a few days later when we came back to the venue to pick up our belongings. Honestly, there are a million other reasons why we'd recommend Walden for your wedding venue, but this is already getting to be too long of a review. Basically, if you’re looking for an all-inclusive venue where you’re genuinely taken care of every step of the way, we cannot recommend Walden highly enough! Thank you, Kalila and Ally, the entire bar/service staff, and truly just everyone at Walden for helping make our wedding day everything we dreamed of and more! P.S. - Make sure you get golden hour photos on the rooftop at Walden...we are soooo delighted with our photos from up there.”Alex D., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/7f2a54c0-13ba-4b68-a3e5-86f145b6534a?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/walden)

The Boylston Rooms 5.0 Easthampton, MA

  * Starts at $6,600 

Founded in 1814, The West Boylston Company was a large textile manufacturer in West Boylston, MA. At the turn of the century the company faced a crisis: the site of their mill would be flooded to form the Wachusett Reservoir. Instead of abandoning the mill, the company dismantled it brick by brick and shipped it to its new home in Easthampton, where it was rebuilt on the banks of the Lower Mill Pond. Now, a century later, The Boylston Rooms retains the integrity of the 1814 original mill in every brick and beam. Our rental includes planners and decor at no added cost. Whatever your style, with over 140 pieces of decor, if you can picture it in the space, we can make it happen.Why you'll love this venue

We initially worked with Amelia and then with Arthur and Kat towards the end of our planning process. Every contact at The Sanctuary was very responsive and accommodating. We loved the space, especially having multiple different areas for guests to enjoy (the chapel for dancing/desserts, the tent for dinner/conversation, and the outdoor patio for smores!) and the beautiful NYC skyline in the background. The bridal suite where we all got ready was spacious and comfortable. I was a little nervous about the temperature in the tent during a November wedding, but it was very comfortable!

Bonus point for being super affordable. The Oviatt team made it really straightforward and easy for us from the jump. From the moment we inquired, Gabe got back to us really fast. He informed us immediately when another couple was interested on the date we were looking at and gave us ample time to lock it in. Lindsey and Cami were our main point of contact after signing the contract, they provide you a welcome kit with all the info you'll need (such as vendor insurance and how to acquire it, parking, rental they can provide, layout guidelines etc.) and a checklist along with their due dates for everything they'll need from you. They even have a preferred vendor list in the welcome kit which is going to help you LOADS in wedding planning. Going with one of their preferred caterers is highly recommended. Oh and their bar? 1000/10 delicious drinks. We still think about the espresso martini. seriously. The value for money is incredible considering everything you'll get and zero hidden fees! We're absolutely in love with this venue. It made our special day even more magical because of its natural charm and the Oviatt team was so lovely to work with.

It takes time and energy and can be very stressful. However, when we say we found the perfect place we mean it. Donauschwaben’s was one of our venue choices coming highly recommended by our friends and family already. We reached out through their website and within no time we got an immediate response from the Christine, Event/ Wedding planner to set up a meeting together. She is not only extremely kind, but had everything organized so beautifully to choose from it was a no-brainer to choose this venue. She even recommended our DJ who had played a previous wedding there who was incredible. All communication leading up to our big day was efficient and layed out easily for us to understand. Our checks were deposited in a timely manner by the venue, our tasting was so nice and so delicious. The no pressure wedding planning was worth every penny spent. Our wedding day was so special and so beautiful from start to finish from the ceremony, to the cocktail hour, to our lovely reception to follow. Not only was Christine present the day of, but the staff was also on their A game all night long. Everyone was so incredibly friendly and kind, we felt like royalty. We both highly recommend this venue and if you do, definitely get the Schnitzel, Prost! The only recommendation to the venue would be to update their beverage packages to include seltzers such as High noons or White claws.

Watson Block's intimate space and Art Deco vibes was perfect for our small (50 guests) wedding. Gaby was so easy to work with, being extremely communicative, professional, and patient with all the questions we had throughout the process. Watson Block's relationships with its partner caterers also made it a one-stop shop for our venue, food, and bar needs. Not only is the space gorgeous and the service top-tier, the price was remarkably affordable, especially given its location in the heart of Minneapolis! Watson Block made it possible for us to have our dream wedding, and we couldn't be more grateful.

Their communication style was quick, concise, and direct, making the planning process a breeze. The quality of their work and overall value was ample, versatile, and absolutely gorgeous. When my previous venue in California double booked me and I had to start my wedding planning all over again, A Simple Affair made the transition so easy. They took care of everything and had no hidden "fine print" fees - what they quoted me is exactly what I paid. I am so glad the previous place double booked me, because I truly can't imagine my wedding being anywhere else. A Simple Affair exceeded all of my expectations and I would recommend them to any couple looking for a stress-free, beautiful wedding experience.”Lizbeth H., 8 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/62e8c4a3-4387-4aee-ba1f-d788d8671fdb?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/a-simple-affair)

“We truly couldn’t have asked for a better day - even with a little rain (which just made it feel extra romantic). Emma was amazing! She kept everything running smoothly while making it feel effortless, relaxed, and totally us.

We actually got to be present and enjoy every moment, thanks to her. Emma, you’re an absolute star. We’re so grateful for you and everything you did to make our day feel magical.

  * Starts at $8,000 

Nazareth Hall is known throughout the region as a banquet and wedding facility, but it’s the rich history and lush setting that draws people here. Built in 1927 as an all-boy Catholic boarding school. It eventually evolved into a renowned military school for boys. Throughout its history the school stayed true to its Catholic roots and the nuns who served and taught here. Operating until 1982 the stories written within its walls are still told today. Re-emerging with a new mission and purpose in April of 1991, Nazareth Hall was reborn. It is in this picturesque place, reminiscent of castles of old, that brides come to be married and celebrate with family and friends in grand ballrooms. The classrooms and meeting spaces offer the perfect vintage background for business training sessions, and the manicured lawns have been host to numerous parties and festivities.Why you'll love this venue

Our wedding was a little over a month now and every time we see a friend it family member, we are overwhelmed with compliments and people telling us that our wedding was the best wedding they’ve ever been to. The trusted vendors they shared were excellent complements to the orchestration that CT wedding group provided. The food and drinks were spectacular ( literally the best wedding food I’ve ever had and we got to customize the menu). The venue was beautiful and it team plugged in anywhere they could to help the decor be cohesive and beautiful. The planning process was a, devoid of stress and fun the whole time! I cannot stress enough how important the staff was to our day especially Lexi and Dmitri- the nuance and meticulous detail they managed our wedding with showed a deep understanding of us as a couple and our vision- we truly felt like they were partners to us as we planned and they mostly managed the wedding planning experience (and we did this from out of state). We were able to incorporate some non traditional details with the help of this team to make our vision a reality such as a New Orleans style second line, playing guests wedding songs so they could dance during dinner and more! The day was absolutely perfect and when I tell you it was perfect, I mean it was everything we dreamed of and more. We were depressed for weeks after because of how much we missed it! I will never stop singing the praises of this team and what they did for us- if you want the wedding of your dreams, trust this team and this venue.”Jordan, 2 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/58e305b0-26f9-4071-9862-ad520182bbe0?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-pavilion-on-crystal-lake)

## About wedding venues

### How much do wedding & reception venues cost?

The cost of wedding venues varies, with [factors influencing cost](/expert-advice/how-much-do-wedding-venues-cost) including size, location, guest count, and, most importantly, whether things like catering and rentals are included. The more a reception venue near you includes, the higher the cost. When considering venues, try to compare prices apples-to-apples. If one venue includes catering and rentals in their pricing and the other doesn’t, you need to figure out how much additional cost those outside vendors would be to make a true comparison. Before booking, be sure you’re aware of additional costs outlined in your contract, like parking fees and weather-related considerations (adding a tent, etc.).

### What questions should we ask wedding venues?

When talking with a potential venue, [always ask](/expert-advice/questions-to-ask-when-touring-a-wedding-venue) about 1) their availability and 2) their capacity. Some popular venues book up peak season Saturdays nearly 2 years in advance—if your first choice date isn’t available, consider your flexibility on day of the week and year. While maximum capacity is non-negotiable, venues might have guidance on what guest count will be most comfortable. Also, you’ll want to understand what is and is not included in the venue’s fees. Some include catering, tables and chairs, and linens, while others offer just the raw space. These venues are often less expensive because you are only paying for the space itself, and you’ll have to bring in outside vendors
