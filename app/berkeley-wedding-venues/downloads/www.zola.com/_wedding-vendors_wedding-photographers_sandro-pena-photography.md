Hi everyone, I’m Sandro Peña, a photographer born and raised in Havana, Cuba, now based in Northern California. Photography has been part of my life since childhood, I grew up watching my mother work as a professional photographer, and her creativity and passion sparked something in me early on. Years later, I picked up my first camera to photograph my car, not realizing it would lead to a life-changing love for capturing moments. Today, I specialize in weddings, elopements, and destination events, creating timeless, emotion-filled imagery that tells each couple’s unique story. Let's chat.

What sets me apart, More than photos I create trust. I’m passionate, loyal, and focused on making clients feel comfortable, confident, and seen, so real moments unfold naturally and your story feels true.
