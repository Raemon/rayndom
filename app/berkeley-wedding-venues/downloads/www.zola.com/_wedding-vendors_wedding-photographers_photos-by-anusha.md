Capturing precious moments and using images to tell a story is something that I am deeply passionate about. I want to make life feel like a movie. My work is heavily inspired by cinematography, fine art, and editorials. My favorite photos make my heart flutter. They can transport you to a moment in time and fill you with emotion. When you work with me, my goal is to capture your most authentic self. I want to capture your real moments, big and small. Dream big for your photos, and I’ll be right there along side you making them come true.

My style highlights the authentic feelings, but doesn’t forget about the posed moments. Your gallery will be one of a kind. because it will be created to represent your unique love story. Your Wedding Photographer is an essential part of your day. My clients can expect to feel comfortable while being photographed. I aim to bring positivity, excitement, and calm to my clients as they experience one of the biggest moments in their life, and am lucky to have a team that brings the same energy. When working with me, you don’t have to spend a second worrying about your wedding photos - you can leave it all to me!

•Verified review

•Abbie F.•Jan 13

Anusha shot my church wedding and my bridal shower. All the pictures came out beautifully, I’m so happy I’ll have these pictures to look back on. She captured both events so perfectly! Anusha was also very easy to work with and made the picture taking process effortless!

  * ### Wedding Engagement Photos!

•Verified review

•Prathyusha N.•Jan 9

I cannot recommend Anusha enough! She captured our proposal and then our city hall ceremony photos and they are some of our favorite photos and moments from our journey. Anusha went above and beyond to ensure she was crafting the right shots for every moment, and she created a natural, organic atmosphere to help us bring out out true selves for the most authentic photos!
