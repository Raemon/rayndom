# Zola Shipping Policy

For most orders placed through a Zola Registry (<https://www.zola.com>) or the Zola Home Store ([_https://homestore.zola.com_](http://www.homestore.zola.com)), we offer free ground shipping. Free shipping is not available for some items, including invites, paper products and stationery items as well as furniture and other large or heavy items. All orders containing invites, paper products and/or stationery items (excluding orders consisting solely of samples and/or proofs) will be subject to shipping charges, which will be disclosed to you at checkout. Furniture and other large or heavy items will be subject to a delivery surcharge due to the size, weight, or special handling necessary to make sure your order arrives safely. To give you the fairest price possible, the delivery surcharge is calculated based on the anticipated cost to deliver that item to you. Details on an item's delivery surcharge can be found in the "Shipping & Returns" section on each product page. 

We also offer two-day expedited shipping on select items for $19.95. Two-Day Shipping is only enabled when all items in a customer’s cart are eligible. If you are unable to select Two-Day Shipping at checkout, please remove any items from the cart that do not qualify. Additional charges apply for shipments to Alaska and Hawaii. We cannot ship to U.S. territories or P.O. Box, APO, FPO, or DPO addresses. If you’d like to only shop for items that are eligible for this benefit, select the “Two-Day Shipping” filter on the left side of the registry or shopping page.

Unfortunately, we’re not able to ship a portion of our products to addresses in Alaska or Hawaii. If an item is not able to be shipped to these states, we’ve indicated this on the item’s product page.

Please note that if the couple for whom you are purchasing a gift is directing you to another website to purchase, Zola's shipping policies do not not apply. At that point, you will be subject to the shipping policy of that third-party website.

Handling or other additional charges may be applied to your order, and such charges will be reflected in your order summary at checkout.

Please note that this Shipping Policy does not apply to orders placed on Zola Baby (<https://baby.zola.com/>). For the Zola Baby Shipping Policy, please see [_https://baby.zola.com/shipping_](http://baby.zola.com/shipping).
