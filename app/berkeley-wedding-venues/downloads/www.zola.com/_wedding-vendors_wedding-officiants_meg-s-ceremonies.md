Hello and Congratulations! I have the best job in the world because I get to tell your story and connect you to each other and your guests. I love to have fun! As a former nurse and teacher, I am sensitive to individual needs and I am very comfortable in front of people.

Every couple is unique and your ceremony should be as well. I meet with my couples to first figure out if we are a good fit for each other. If hired I ask a lot of questions to get at the heart of your relationship and then I start writing. We work together to find out what elements you want and I come up with unity rituals that may fit you. It is YOUR ceremony!

**In three words:** Collaborative, Creative, Empathetic

  * ### She was amazing.

•Verified review

•Victoria D.•Nov 23, 2025

Meg’s Ceremonies was truly the perfect choice for our wedding officiant, and we feel so lucky to have found her. From the very beginning, Meg made us feel at ease. She was incredibly communicative, always open to feedback, and quick to respond to our messages—no matter how small the question or how last-minute the request. It felt like we had someone in our corner who genuinely cared about making our ceremony reflect us, and that kind of support meant the world during such a busy and emotional time. In the weeks leading up to the wedding, Meg guided us through the process with patience and kindness. She took the time to learn our story, listen to our ideas, and weave them together into something that felt both personal and polished. We never once felt rushed or pressured; instead, Meg created a space where we could be ourselves and trust that she would bring our vision to life. On the wedding day itself, Meg exceeded every expectation. Her attention to detail was impeccable, and her comedic timing was spot-on—she had our guests laughing, smiling, and tearing up in all the right moments. The way she told our story was heartfelt and hilarious, striking that perfect balance between romance and humor that we had hoped for. Our friends and family still talk about how much they enjoyed the ceremony, and we know that’s thanks to Meg’s talent and warmth. Beyond the ceremony, Meg went above and beyond to make the entire experience seamless. While we were busy mingling with family and taking photos, she quietly took care of signing the marriage license so we didn’t have to worry about a thing. She even surprised us with a sweet goodie bag and a personalized book that matched the pastel and floral theme of our wedding—a thoughtful touch that made us feel so seen and celebrated. Looking back, we couldn’t have asked for a better officiant. Meg brought joy, professionalism, and genuine heart to every step of the process. The value she provided was exceptional, but more importantly, she gave us memories we’ll cherish forever. If you’re looking for someone who is warm, professional, and truly gifted at what she does, we cannot recommend Meg’s Ceremonies enough. She will make your day not only beautiful, but unforgettable.

  * ### Meg Told Our Love Story Perfectly

•Verified review

•Harry C.•Jun 7, 2025

Finding the right officiant was one of the more difficult parts of planning our wedding. After interviewing several candidates, we still weren't sure, until we read Meg's reviews. From the moment we read what others had to say, we knew she was the one. Just as she has done for many others, Meg tailored our wedding ceremony to beautifully capture the journey my wife and I share. Meg took the time to get to know us through a series of questionnaires to learn about how we met, our journey together, and who we are as a couple and as individuals. She used our responses to craft a ceremony that reflected our relationship perfectly. The first draft she sent us already felt so close to what we wanted, and she even made sure to include several options throughout the script depending on whether we wanted a more Catholic style or modern style. As I come from a Catholic upbringing, Meg included a prayer as well as a scripture reading which meant a lot to my family. My wife and I believed that we had a beautiful story behind our relationship and we wanted to tell that story in a way that would resonate with our guests. Meg helped us execute our vision exactly how we wanted it and our guests had nothing but great things to say. Several guests told us they were moved to tears. One person even assumed Meg was a longtime friend because of how well she captured our love story. We could not have been happier with how our wedding ceremony turned out and we are beyond grateful to have had Meg as our officiant. We wouldn't hesitate to recommend her to anyone seeking a personalized and heartfelt wedding ceremony.

  * ### The Ceremony Everyone’s Still Talking About!

•Verified review

•Lorenzo S.•Apr 22, 2025

Meg was one of the best decisions we made for our wedding. She was truly a highlight of the day, and so many of our guests told us it was the best ceremony they’d ever witnessed. It was heartfelt, personal, and full of joy—people kept saying how refreshing it was that the ceremony wasn’t “stuffy” at all. Meg brought such a warm, light-hearted energy. She’s a fantastic storyteller who really knew how to engage the crowd and make everyone feel included. Her process was just as thoughtful as the ceremony itself. She took the time to truly get to know me and my wife, and she worked closely with us to build a ceremony that reflected us—our love, our values, and our story. From traditions to wording, she guided us every step of the way with clarity and care. Meg is professional, personable, and an excellent communicator. If you’re looking for a non-denominational yet spiritual celebration of love, we can’t recommend her highly enough. She made our ceremony unforgettable.
