I started shooting photos and video in Greece, and since moving to the US, I have dedicated myself to shooting weddings, elopements and engagements. I love being able to capture the love that my couples have for each other and the unique energy each couple has. I am always down to shoot in new locations and find the best place for my shoots!

I think something that sets me apart is that I am always trying to get my couples to feel comfortable and heard. I want your photo shoot to feel like you are with a friend, not like you are in a business transaction. Go wine tasting, take a picnic to the beach—my goal is to be capturing real moments, not just poses.

  * ### The best around

•Verified review

•Natalie M.•Dec 16, 2025

From our first interaction, Te Dua Weddings impressed us with their fast, efficient, and helpful communication style. Their work was absolutely perfect - customized, vibrant, and flawless. They made it easy for us and we didn't have to worry at all, capturing our love story perfectly. They truly are so easy to work with and it was a pleasure to have our special day captured by them.

  * ### AMAZING!

•Verified review

•Bella S.•Nov 14, 2025

We had the most amazing experience with Enea as our wedding photographer! he was so nice, communicative, and made us feel comfortable as people who don’t normally take pictures. Our family and wedding party commented on how great he was as well. We cried looking at our pictures, he really captured us so perfectly and it gave us such beautiful memories to look back on. Book him immediately!! You won’t regret it ️

  * ### Te Dua Weddings Turned Our Nerves into Pure Magic!

•Verified review

•Da'Shawn W.•Oct 29, 2025

From the very first phone call, Enea set the tone for everything that followed. We’re not “picture people” at all, so the idea of an engagement shoot at San Francisco City Hall had us both quietly panicking. Enea’s warmth, humor, and genuine conversation melted every ounce of awkwardness away. We laughed more than we posed, and somehow walked out with **stunning, frame-worthy shots** that still make us grin. My husband loved them so much he had them printed and sewn onto the lining of the vest he wore on our wedding day – talk about a keepsake! Come the wedding day, Te Dua’s team was a dream. We got all the classic staged portraits we wanted, but what stole our hearts were the candid, in-the-moment captures: friends tearing up the dance floor, champagne toasts mid-laugh, family members just having a good time every second of joy preserved forever. And then there’s Luke, the videographer – wow. The highlight film he delivered is straight out of a Hollywood romance. The editing, the music, the pacing… it’s an emotional roller-coaster that replays the entire day in under ten minutes. I’ve watched it on repeat and cry every single time. Turnaround wasn’t instant, but every second of the wait was worth it. The quality, care, and artistry shine through in every photo and frame of video. Te Dua Weddings Photography isn’t just a vendor – they’re memory-makers. If you want to relive your day with tears of happiness for years to come, book them. 10/10, no hesitation, highly recommend!

  * ### An absolute dream to work with!

•Verified review

•Roxanne M.•Oct 20, 2025

Working with them is an absolute dream!Hayley at Te Dua Weddings was one of the best decisions we made for our wedding. From the very first message, she was warm, organized, and incredibly thoughtful. On the day of our wedding, she brought such a calm, positive energy—blending in seamlessly with our crew while capturing every meaningful moment without ever feeling staged or forced. Her eye for detail is unreal. Watching our film felt like reliving the day all over again—the emotions, the laughter, the quiet moments, the chaos, and the love. She didn’t just record what happened; she told our story. The editing, color, and music choices were absolutely perfect and so us. Our family and friends have watched it countless times and still tear up every single viewing. Hayley’s professionalism, creativity, and genuine care made the entire process effortless and joyful. We can’t thank her enough for giving us something we’ll treasure forever. If you’re lucky enough to have her available for your date—book her immediately.

## Frequently asked questions

6 Answers

Ask them a question

### Do you have insurance?

I do! Just let me know if your venue requires a certificate of liability, and I’ll reach out the the venue directly.

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Honestly, as soon as possible. The wedding industry moves quickly, so as soon as I know a couple is interested, I want to book them right away to ensure I can capture their day. With that said, I only require a 20% deposit to book the date, so couples don’t have to worry about a huge financial burden to book.

### Do you work with assistants or other photographers?

Yes, Frequently! Most often, I shoot with my wife, Hayley, but I also work with a small group of other shooters in the Bay--all of whom I have a lot of respect for because I know what good work they do. If you are considering an extra shooter for your day, know that I only work with shooters I have shot with previously and know the quality of their work!

### Will you edit all our pictures?

Yes--I color edit all of my images to make sure all the colors and details look exactly as you remember them in person. I really like keeping my color pallets as natural as possible so your images are timeless.

### Do you also offer video services?

Yes! In fact, video is one of my favorite things to shoot. Photos are amazing, but video captures movement and emotion in a ways photos just can't. Video is the one thing I always tell couples that they should not skimp on!

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

It really depends on the shoot and number of hours I am shooting/how much content needs edited. For a one hour engagement shoot, you will probably receive your album within a few days. For 8+ hour weddings or multi-day shoots, you can expect a turn around of 2-3 weeks.
