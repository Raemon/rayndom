From the moment we toured the space, we knew it was very special. The staff was professional, attentive, and truly went above and beyond to make everything run smoothly. The venue itself is absolutely stunning—beautifully maintained with breathtaking views and a warm, welcoming atmosphere. The food was amazing, and they made us feel so special on our wedding day.

“From the moment we booked Sacred Oak Vineyard and Venue, Jake and Chelsea were prompt, warm, and incredibly helpful throughout the entire planning process. Their affordable, clean, and well-appointed venue was the perfect backdrop for my daughter's special day. They ensured all of our vendors knew exactly where to go and how to set up, and even assisted us with chair and table arrangements as well as parking logistics. Jake and Chelsea went above and beyond, offering additional decorations and vendor recommendations that truly made our wedding day seamless and stress-free. The vineyard and the old oak tree were perfect backdrops for the ceremony and photo ops. The grounds are AMAZING!!! We are so grateful for their professionalism and hospitality - they made my daughter's wedding dreams come true!”Elyse P., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/ebe729fa-c225-421e-9a7b-636dc7d2987b?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/sacred-oak-vineyard-and-venue)

![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We were looking for a place to host a special gathering and had a pretty set budget — and honestly, Panorama Paradiso Villa was perfect. From the moment we stepped onto the deck, we were completely blown away. The panoramic view is unreal — rolling hills, open sky, total peace. It gave the entire day such a magical, relaxed vibe. The space felt both elegant and down-to-earth, and the deck was where everyone naturally gathered. There was plenty of room for lounging, playing games, chatting, and taking in the scenery. It didn’t feel like we had to sacrifice anything to stay within our budget — if anything, it felt like we got way more than we expected. If you’re planning something special and want a beautiful setting without going overboard on cost, this is 100% the spot.

She also gave us so many amazing recommendations on placements, decorations, and locations within the venue. Her team, including Jen and Ayden, are so helpful, collaborative, and welcoming.

The venue itself is absolutely gorgeous, with a luxurious and spacious feel that provided the perfect backdrop for our celebration.

![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“My Husband and I were engaged at Churon and decided to have our wedding there as well. We love the beauty of this venue, the setting, as well as the European feel and decor. We wanted a private ceremony (just my Husband and I) and asked Churon to help coordinate our essentials. Churon's event planner arranged a pastor, photographer and florist, all of which could not have been any better. They also referred us to a great hair and makeup artist, AlyRose Beauty who I was also so happy and grateful for. We were also thrilled with our wedding suite which was over the top! Our day was intimate, special and perfect in every way for us. I am so thankful for Churon's understanding of our vision and their efforts and experience in the coordination. I highly recommend this venue for either a large size or private wedding. Thank you Churon!”Maggie & M., 3 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/inn-at-churon-winery)

From the fairytale-like venue to the planning team, to the food and dessert, everything truly exceeded our expectations. We planned our entire wedding in just three months, but the Wedgewood team kept us organized, on track and supported every step of the way. Choosing their all-inclusive package made the process so much easier, we didn’t have to stress about finding a caterer, DJ, or wedding planner because everything was seamlessly handled for us. This allowed us to focus on the décor and all the special details that made our day everything we could have ever wished for. Although we barely had time to eat, we heard from countless guests that the food was absolutely delicious. So many people raved about how great everything tasted. Our wedding day was perfect and we genuinely couldn’t be more grateful for the entire Wedgewood team. They are truly exceptional at what they do, and there was always someone available to answer questions, provide guidance and support us in every moment. I cannot say enough great things about Alison especially. She guided us through the planning process, our rehearsal and the entire wedding day with such professionalism, kindness and expertise. I’m someone who is extremely hands-on with every detail, yet Alison earned my complete trust. She handled everything so seamlessly that I was able to truly relax and be fully present, something I honestly didn’t think would be possible. She made sure every member of our wedding party felt supported and knew exactly where to be and when. She oversaw the setup of all our rentals, coordinated our décor and double-checked every detail to ensure everything looked perfect. She communicated with all our vendors, kept us on schedule and handled anything that came up before I even knew about it. She truly went above and beyond, she even stayed later than scheduled because I didn’t want her to leave. Because of Alison, our day was absolutely flawless. I also want to acknowledge and thank Maddie, Amanda, Ramey, and Crystal for being so kind, patient, and thorough throughout the entire planning process. These ladies never missed a single detail. Ramey was actually the first person we met and she gave us such a warm, informative tour of the venue. She answered all of our questions thoroughly and made us feel confident and excited from the very beginning. We are so grateful for this entire team and would recommend them wholeheartedly to any couple looking for a group of professionals who truly care and make the experience feel effortless.”Chelsey, 2 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/d1b3f508-e23b-48d0-bc30-409b4d06a7b5?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/avensole-winery-by-wedgewood-weddings)

“Having our wedding at Rancho Bellasante was a dream come true! The McIntyre family were beyond kind and extremely accommodating to every need we had. The wedding coordinator, Tiffany, was instrumental in our successful wedding. She took care of every detail and made sure our experience stress free. The day of was so well orchestrated, we couldn't be more grateful. The best part of this venue is the the venue itself. The views are INCREDIBLE.

“I just got married at CRC Ranch last week and I can't say enough amazing words about this place and the team. The venue is absolutely breathtaking and I heard from so many guests about how great of a venue it was and how they've never been to a wedding like that before and how much fun it was. Not only do the staff completely bring our vision to life, but made it even better than we could've imagined. Traecy and her team were a dream to work with and made planning everything stress-free and easy. They were so accommodating and a pleasure to work with.

“The listing pictures don’t do Secluded Garden Estate justice. It’s absolutely beautiful in person, especially for an afternoon wedding at golden hour. Our guests are still telling us how beautiful the location was several weeks later. Our wedding photos look like they came right out of Lord of the Rings! The venue includes three separate areas for the ceremony, cocktail, and reception, with convenient electrical access, kitchenette, and guest restrooms. The hosts, Emily and Dennis, were incredibly easy to work with and put us at ease right away. They are knowledgeable without being pushy, and professional without making us feel like we were being sold to. Highly recommend if you are looking for a beautiful outdoor venue.”Jenny B., 2 years ago![](https://images.zola.com/c5c56499-2191-4e36-8e1a-34d6a9a3f1ae?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/secluded-garden-estate)

“I don't even know what to say because I'm so overwhelmed with how perfect everything went on our wedding day. I get more and more obsessed the more I look back at photos! We were at their Villa de Fiore venue and I can't speak of it highly enough - the bridal suite is HUGE and so comfortable, and the groom's suite (though smaller) is also stunning. Being able to have the ceremony, cocktail hour and reception back to back in the same spot was so convenient, not to mention the stunning location. Everyone we worked with at Monserate was so amazing, professional and helpful. Hali took over as our main contact a few months before our wedding and she was an absolute gem, so friendly and incredibly helpful. She was also onsite day-of for anything we needed and helped the whole day run smoothly (even made sure I got my espresso martini before the ceremony after the bartenders told my maid of honor they couldn't serve us yet). She also gifted us a bottle of champagne with a sweet hand-written card afterwards and offered to buy us lunch any time we returned to their winery. Though this might be standard practice for their coordinators, it still meant a lot to us as a couple!”Ali P., 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/9c6bd099-324b-49ad-ae81-15f032abf9b3?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/monserate-winery)

![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Daniel and Stephanie run a world class event catering & planning business. They handled both our welcome party and wedding recently - both events were outstanding. Planning was very easy, and Chef Daniel is world class (with a resume to prove it as well as the food). Most guests described the food as the best they’ve ever had at a wedding - no exaggeration. I will 100% be hiring Holy Saints for future events and is the top caterer in LA I will be recommending to anyone in the future. Their pastry chef is a master as well. A review with NO complaints.”Jennifer L., 3 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/holy-saints)

## About wedding venues in El Sobrante, CA

### 

California offers an incredible 840 miles of coastline, 3,000+ wineries and ancient redwoods for your wedding day. When you choose the Golden State, you're getting exceptional natural lighting for your ceremony across diverse settings from Mediterranean coastal zones to alpine mountain backdrops. Each region has its own distinctive character that can perfectly match your vision.

### What Makes California Wedding Venues So Special?

Northern California's Napa Valley welcomes you with rolling vineyards and Spanish colonial architecture where intimate wine cave ceremonies create unforgettable moments. Head to Southern California and you'll find oceanfront venues like Duke's Malibu where you can exchange vows with the Pacific stretching out behind you while enjoying fresh coastal-inspired cuisine. Palm Springs offers dramatic desert venues with mountain backdrops and striking midcentury modern architecture that photographs beautifully.

### How Much Do Wedding Venues in California Cost?

Wedding venues in California typically run between $9,600 and $11,700 which aligns nicely with the national range of $6,500-$12,000. This represents about 18% of your total wedding budget. Your overall costs will vary based on guest count:

  * 50 guests: $26,190
  * 100 guests: $43,692

Accessibility options have improved greatly across California venues in recent years.

### When Should You Book Your California Wedding Venue?

October leads venue inquiries in California with couples typically booking venues about 13 months (400 days) before their wedding date. If you're dreaming of a Northern California wine country wedding during peak season you'll want to book up to 18 months in advance. Southern California venues offer more flexibility especially during winter months when you can still enjoy beautiful weather while potentially securing better rates.
