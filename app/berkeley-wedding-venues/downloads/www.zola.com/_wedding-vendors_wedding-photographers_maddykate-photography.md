  * ### 10/10!

•Verified review

•Tristen C.•Oct 7, 2025

Maddy truly was the best decision we made for our wedding day. We were lucky to know right of the bat who we wanted our vendors to be. Photography we spent so much time deciding and finding someone who felt perfect for us. Not only was Maddy the kindest person we had the pleasure of working with, she was also the most attentive. Any problem or scheduling issue that popped up, she was the first to find a solution. We had to reschedule and move our engagement shoot too many times because weather was not on our side and she was so quick to help. Our pre-wedding consultation made us feel extra prepared because I knew nothing would fall through the cracks and we were all on the same page together. I would book with Maddy again for my wedding if I could. The photos from your wedding truly tell the story of the day, and you will not regret Maddy telling that story with you!!

  * ### The most amazing photos! 

•Verified review

•Cassidy A.•Sep 2, 2025

I had never had professional photos done previously, but I wanted some 21st birthday/couple photos done and Maddy made it happen! She directed me so easily and made it feel fun and memorable! I want to get 1000 more photo shoots done by her.

  * ### AMAZING!!

•Verified review

•Emma S.•Sep 2, 2025

We used Maddy for our wedding and we cannot have asked for anyone better. She helped with our timeline and was always quick to respond when we had questions. Our photos turned out amazing and she captured our day so beautifully! Would definitely recommend!

Maddy went absolutely above and beyond for us on our most special (but also stressful) day. She communicated well with us each step of the way and has created little masterpieces for us to keep forever!

## Frequently asked questions

6 Answers

Ask them a question

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

My books tend to fill fast so I highly recommend securing your date with me as soon as you have secured it with your venue! I open my books about a year out.

### Do you work with assistants or other photographers?

I do! I always travel with an assistant or associate photographer and sometimes both! Having help always makes sure that I can better assist you and perform my photography role to the highest ability.

### Will you edit all our pictures?

Absolutely! All of your images will be hand selected and edited by me. I work closely to understand my clients style and visions and ultimately ask that you only hire me if you truly love my editing style. I can always lean into a direction and love to experiment but I have my own unique artistic editing style and am not willing to copy another artists work.

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

My turnaround time varies by season. Typically, you’ll be able to view a sneak peek online about 2 weeks after your wedding. You can expect a full finished gallery no later than 12 weeks.

### How many pictures will we get?

Each of my packages offer a different set amount of images. The longer the session the more images that are included with your package. I also offer additional Digital image purchases for those who are looking to get more out of their gallery. Pricing for additional image purchases can be discussed during the editing process.

### What’s your back-up plan if you can’t photograph our wedding as planned?

In the very rare event that I’m unable to photograph your wedding, I’ll make sure you’re covered by one of my colleagues or my contracted associate photographers. They will shoot your wedding in my place and deliver the images to me where I will still edit and deliver them to you as scheduled. You can rest easy knowing my wide network of talented associate photographers would take care of you in the same way and standard I would!
