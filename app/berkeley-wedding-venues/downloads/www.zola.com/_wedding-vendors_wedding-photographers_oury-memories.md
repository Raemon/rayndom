I have been a photographer for 8 years. Throughout my time as a photographer I’ve captured clothing, models, and memories. I shifted from corporate shootings to families and weddings because it gave me this warm fuzzy feeling when I edited my couples and families photos. Don’t be afraid to reach out to me and ask about my photography style, my editing style, or my favorite restaurant! I highly recommend scheduling a free consulting session!

I always start with a consulting session with my couples and families. It’s a mixture of how I can incorporate my skills to capture the best of both of you. It’s your day, it’s about you two. I will be that photographer who will climb a tree to get that perfect angle, that being said I want you guys to look back and love your photos. I want you to feel the love and that moment.

•Verified review

•Jenna C.•May 27, 2025

Grace was an extremely professional and focused presence on our wedding day! Her attentiveness made sure we got all of the shots we wanted despite the chaos of the day, and she made sure to discuss our vision thoroughly before the big day! We are soo unbelievably excited to see our pictures, as we know they will be incredible! Grace is a truly serious and devoted artist to her craft.

  * ### Perfect Wedding Photos with Oury Memories!

•Verified review

•Sabrina B.•Mar 25, 2025

From the moment my husband and I first spoke to Grace, we were impressed by her open and kind communication style. Throughout the planning process, Grace was quick to respond to our questions and provide helpful guidance. On our wedding day, Grace went above and beyond to make me and everyone in my bridal party feel confident and seen. Her excellent, knowledgeable and detailed work truly captured the magic of our special day. Grace did an excellent job posing our large bridal party efficiently to keep us on schedule. We are thrilled with the beautiful, detailed photos that will allow us to relive our most cherished moments for years to come.

  * ### Picture perfect day!

•Amy and K.•Oct 20, 2024

I would absolutely recommend grace and oury memories. She was so responsive and organized with making sure we got all the perfect shots. She also was extremely patient when it came to our kids and knew how important they were to be in some shots as well. She kept everything running smoothly and I appreciate that so much. We are so excited to see our photos and have no doubt that they will be so beautiful. Thank you cso much for helping to make our day so wonderful!!

  * ### Wedding Photos

•Verified review

•Tina Y.•Oct 8, 2024

Grace was a pleasure to work with during the wedding planning process. She was timely in her responses and upfront with pricing. On the day of the wedding, it felt like we were herding cats, but she remained professional and efficient. Even though we were running behind schedule with getting dressed, she managed to squeeze in a few dress shots and some first look photos. Grace remained patient even as some of our friends and family showed up late for photos! As we moved between locations, she made sure I was holding my dress in a way so that I wouldn’t fall on my face. She also helped my MOH bustle my dress after the ceremony (again, so I wouldn’t fall on my face). Grace was always cognizant of the lighting on location, and how it would affect photos. Her assistant, Joey, was lovely and accommodating as well. All in all, a wonderful experience!

## Frequently asked questions

5 Answers

Ask them a question

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically, couples book me about 13 months before their wedding date. I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible about my availability, even if you’re planning on a shorter time frame. Based on availability I have done elopements for couples as soon as three weeks.

### Will you edit all our pictures?

Definitely. All final images will be edited for color, saturation, exposure, and sharpness to ensure they look beautiful. I also offer retouching services on an ask basis during our consultation appointment.

### How many pictures will we get?

You can expect about 80 to 100 images per hour of photographing. But keep in mind this estimate varies depending on your wedding package, number of guests, venue type, and other factors.

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

My turnaround time varies by season. Typically, you’ll be able to view your photos online about 4-6 weeks after your wedding. Within this time, you can also expect to receive a USB drive with high-resolution image files, so you can share the photos with your loved ones and order prints.

### Do you work with assistants or other photographers?

Sometimes, I’ll bring one or more assistant photographers depending on the size of your wedding. Don’t worry, this won’t cost you extra.
