KURO Creative House (formerly Hereafter Films) is a wedding production house of talented videographers & photographers serving Central Texas & the Pacific Northwest. Throw out the stress of formulaic & performative weddings. We want you to have an experience-driven, true-to-you celebration with cohesive & creative wedding photography & videography to remember it all. When your veil flies in your face, when you wipe your tears on your sleeve, when you dance until you can't breathe, that's where we thrive.

With our team of like-minded and creative shooters capturing your wedding, you can feel confident knowing your experience and memories are the priority. We value experimentation and want to encourage each couple to break the wedding day mold. We welcome the rough and tumble, the mosh pitters and crowd surfers, the all candid, raw, unpolished moments. It’s not about being the host of an event. It’s about being the guests of honor and centering the day on whatever resonates with you. What matters is the experience, your experience. And having it captured in an honest way to relive forever.

  * ### So Grateful We Found Hereafter Films

•Verified review

•Ruby M.•Jan 2, 2026

Hereafter Films was one of the first vendors we booked early on in the wedding planning process, and we are sooooooo glad we did! Ryan and Sharayah were amazing to work with, along with their entire team. They photographed both our engagement session and our wedding day, and honestly, both sets of photos came out better than we could have imagined! Photography was one of the most important parts of our wedding. We really wanted our day to be captured in a way that felt authentic, emotional, and true to who we are, and Hereafter ABSOLUTELY nailed it! We looked at a lot of photographers, but the second we saw their portfolio, we were sold. Their style immediately stood out, and the fact that they shoot 35mm film was huge for us. The Super 8 option was such a fun bonus and made us even more excited about working with them. Their work feels timeless, intentional, and full of real emotion. On the wedding day itself, it felt incredible knowing we didn’t have to worry about a single thing when it came to photography and video. We trusted their creative process 1000%, and they truly made the entire day feel effortless. They handled our family and friends with so much patience, care, and ease, and so many people kept telling us how wonderful they were. Looking through our photos now instantly brings us right back to how the day felt, which is something we’ll always be grateful for. Beyond their obvious talent and artistry, Ryan and Sharayah are just genuinely awesome, laid-back, fun people to be around, and their calm, cool energy made such a difference. We feel incredibly lucky to have had them capture one of the most important days of our lives. 1000000% recommend booking Hereafter Films!

•Verified review•Incentivized review

•Hope A.•Oct 26, 2025

Hereafter Films was an absolute pleasure to work with for our wedding photography. From the very first interaction, their communication was prompt, detailed, and made us feel at ease. Ryan and Sharayah were so knowledgeable and trustworthy, capturing beautiful moments throughout our special day. I was able to fully enjoy myself without worrying about how the pictures would turn out - Hereafter Films handled everything flawlessly. The final products were stunning, and we are so grateful to have such wonderful memories captured. I would highly recommend Hereafter Films to any couple looking for talented, professional, and personable wedding vendors.

Hereafter Films was an excellent choice for our wedding photography and videography. Sharayah & Ryan have a strong creative vision, and yet remain flexible to capture spontaneous moments. They were incredibly responsive to our needs and open to incorporating our ideas. The quality of their work is superb. They kept us on schedule seamlessly, managing to command a room of happy, chaotic guests in a kind and nonintrusive way. Hereafter Films played a crucial role in ensuring our wedding day was perfect, and we highly recommend them!!

## Frequently asked questions

8 Answers

Ask them a question

### What are the advantages of booking your Photo & Video package?

1\. We’re a one-stop-shop to preserve all your wedding memories & moments. One contract, one invoice, one team to communicate your vision to. 2. You’ll get cohesive & creative photo & video deliverables. We’ve spent a lot of time honing in our look & style of capture so that your photos & video feel like continuations of each other rather than separate take aways from the day. 3. We’re a strong, intuitive team. We know how to shoot around & with each other harmoniously rather than having a separate photographer and videographer butting heads all day to capture their best work.

### Where are you based out of & what do you require for travel?

Our team is based out of Austin, Texas and Portland, Oregon but is available to travel anywhere! For locations in Texas or Oregon/Washington that are 50 miles outside of our home zip codes, there is a travel fee based on mileage round-trip (72 cents/mile per IRS Standards 2026). Overnight accommodations will also be requested for weddings over three hours away. We have packages for U.S. Elopements & Destination Weddings that include travel cost, but depending on location and season, there may need to be additional travel compensation. A custom package can be created for International Weddings.

### What is your payment plan? How can we pay you?

To reserve your date, we require a 30% deposit. The remainder of your package price will be due no later than thirty days before your wedding day. We have accounts with various secure online payment services. Zelle (bank transfer) is preferred to avoid processing fees. We also accept checks by mail, or if you are local, we would love to meet up with you to put a face to all the emails and to chat before the wedding day!

### What gear do you use?

We shoot on high resolution digital cameras and we film entirely in 4K, 10 bit color and capture RAW photos. For those of you who don’t talk in camera jargon, that just means you are getting some of the best quality footage & photos cameras can offer, large enough to be played in a movie theater without losing detail and providing us with the most color information to play with while editing your film & photos. We love mixed media and experiment with a variety of vintage 35mm & medium format film cameras, polaroids, camcorder style video & Super 8 film.

### What is your delivery timeframe?

Photo galleries are delivered within two months & Highlight Videos are delivered within three months. Depending on the season & your particular deliverables, our delivery time frame may vary. We can definitely speed edit, but we prefer to give you a quality product you will enjoy for the rest of your life than give you immediate gratification from a rushed video or photo deliverable. We send about 80-100 preview photos within one week of the wedding day. And if you’re wanting to see a bit of your video sooner, we do offer a handful of Instagram Reels delivered within one week as an Add On.

### Do you have insurance?

Yup! Just let us know if your venue requires a certificate of liability, and we can send that over to them.

### Do you also offer video services?

YES! We offer a Photo & Video package that is our bread & butter, but we also have several Add Ons that can be purchased with your our Photography package including documentation of your vows, a Super 8 Mini Film, a Save The Date film & more! Check out our packages to learn more or our Videography listing on Zola: https://www.zola.com/wedding-vendors/wedding-videographers/hereafter-films

### Why do I see the name "Hereafter Films" on your Zola reviews?

We rebranded and changed our name in 2026 to KURO Creative House so you may see Hereafter Films a few places from the 8 years we operated with that name.
