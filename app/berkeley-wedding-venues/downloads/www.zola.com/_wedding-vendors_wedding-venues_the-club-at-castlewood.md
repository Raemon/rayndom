## About this venue

The Club at Castlewood resides on the former estate of California's most beloved hostess, Phoebe Apperson Hearst. Her mansion, La Hacienda del Pozo de Verona was built in the 1890's, The mansion was designed by renowned architect Julia Morgan, the architect for the Hearst Castle at San Simeon. After her death in 1919, her son, William Randolph Hearst, maintained the property. In 1924, he sold it to a group of businessmen who turned it into a Country Club. Two Golf Courses were added, one on the hillside in 1926, and one in the valley in 1948. The Porte Cochere and entryway with its large doors offers an appealing and engaging sense of old-fashioned charm while the Spanish tiled grand lobby is reminiscent of a by-gone era. Offering high ceilings, a 6,000 square foot Ballroom, an additional 2,000 square foot bar and a 2,000 square foot patio area, we are certain that you will have the space needed for your special event.
