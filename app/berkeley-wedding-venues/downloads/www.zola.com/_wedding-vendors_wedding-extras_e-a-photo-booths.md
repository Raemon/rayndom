  * ### 10/10 Photo booth service!

•Verified review

•Joey (.•Oct 7, 2025

As the bride, I can honestly say having E&A Photo Booths at our wedding was one of the best choices we made! Manny was incredible to work with! Super professional, friendly, and made everything so seamless. Our guests LOVED the booth! Friends, family, even our older relatives were jumping in all night and having so much fun. The props were amazing and photo prints came out so beautiful, just as what we envisioned. Everyone kept telling us how much fun they had, and the photos we got afterward are priceless. It was such a fun, interactive part of the night and brought so much energy to the reception. 10/10 highly recommend Manny and Andrea at E&A Photo Booths!

Response from vendor•Oct 8, 2025

Thank you, Joey for letting us be part of your beautiful day. I must say your family and friends love taking pictures. There was always a huge line for the Photo Booth. I must say it was very flattering. I hope you had a chance to view your online gallery. Thank you for the compliment. Hope to see you again.

E&A Photo Booths was an amazing vendor from start to finish. They were very attentive to our needs and easy to communicate with throughout the entire process. The quality of their work was top-notch - they were polite, entertaining, and respectful, which really helped make our special day even more memorable! We would 100% recommend E&A Photo Booths to our friends and family.

•Max•Sep 21, 2025

Thanks guys so much for all of your smiles and interactions with our guests. A lot of them never used a photo booth before and had no clue what to do. I got so much great feedback about how nice and helpful you were. I highly recommend E&A Photo Booths! Ps. They didn’t post any images of my wedding per my request, super respectful!

Response from vendor•Sep 21, 2025

Max, you’re so very welcome! When sending out photo booth attendants we match them to the vibe of our clients. Thank you for taking the time to let is know how we did!
