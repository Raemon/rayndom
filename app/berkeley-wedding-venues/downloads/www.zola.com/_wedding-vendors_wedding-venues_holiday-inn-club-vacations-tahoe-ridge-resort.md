  * ### Dream Wedding

•Verified review

•Hayley and R.•Dec 30, 2020

Planned and had our wedding during COVID - there was so many changes but both Blair and Katie was open and helpful about making our day as best as possible. Wouldn’t want it any other way, thank you again Katie and Blair!

  * ### Have your wedding here!

•Verified review

•Staci and D.•Dec 18, 2020

Even during Covid, and with all the changes needing to be done to be compliant, our wedding was amazing!! The food was phenomenal. Katie and Blair were a dream to work with. Stressful times, stressful day, and I didn’t stress one bit on the day of my wedding. Things went smooth. We couldn’t have imagined a better day. I highly recommend them
