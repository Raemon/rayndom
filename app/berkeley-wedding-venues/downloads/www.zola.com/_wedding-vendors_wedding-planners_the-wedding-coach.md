  * ### Sf City Hall Ceramony

•Verified review

•Cassie R.•Dec 29, 2024

Since hiring Sanford from day one (6 months before Ceremony) he has always kept in communication via email and zoom. He asked my husband and I our ideal Ceremony style. He had us fill out a questionnaire separately and told us not to share our answers with eachother. Once the day arrived he customized our Ceremony to tell our love story exactly how we imagined/ wanted it! Sanford has a great personality and can tell your story! I will definitely be referring him to my friends ;)

•Verified review

•Amit & P.•Oct 29, 2024

Working with Marshall and The Wedding Coach was a wonderful experience from start to finish. They were attentive and to the point in their communication, ensuring we were always on the same page. The quality of their work and the value they provided was great - they were a pleasure to work with. On our wedding day, they went above and beyond, restocking our drink supply without us even asking and bringing us snacks to keep us fueled through the hustle and bustle. Eight years later, we're still grateful for their exceptional service, which is why we were happy to write this review at Marshall's request. We highly recommend The Wedding Coach to any couple planning their special day.

  * ### Best officiant ever!!!

•Verified review

•Brooke B.•Oct 11, 2024

Working with The Wedding Coach, Sanford, was such a personalized and meaningful experience from start to finish. His communication style was personal, funny, and really helped us reflect on what was most important for our special day. The questionnaire he sent us was so thoughtful - it helped us plan an intimate, fantastic, and fully customized wedding celebration. Sanford gave us an unforgettable experience, and by the end of the night, our guests were asking how we met him because he felt like our best friend. We couldn't recommend The Wedding Coach more highly for couples looking for a truly special and customized wedding planning experience.

  * ### Best Decision We Made!

•Verified review

•Francesca•Oct 10, 2024

Hiring Sanford Marshall, The Wedding Coach was by far the best decision we made for our wedding! He consistently went above and beyond to ensure all details of our vision were actualized. He took the time to get to know us on a personal level and incorporated what he had learned into a magnificent ceremony that encapsulated the tone we were striving to convey perfectly. He was responsive and unflinching amidst changing requirements, even in the weeks preceding the wedding. We are certain to use his services in the future for planning additional events and know they will turn out just as well.
