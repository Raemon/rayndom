  * ### Amazing Value for Napa

•Verified review

•Alexis L.•Dec 3, 2025

Fairview Napa was an amazing venue for our wedding. From the very beginning, their communication was fast and great, which was so helpful in the busy wedding planning process. The venue itself had a beautiful, rustic charm with the surrounding trees providing a lovely natural backdrop. The venue coordinators were awesome to work with and helped us find affordable solutions to make our day perfect. The overall value of Fairview Napa was outstanding, and we would highly recommend this venue to any couple looking for a stunning, yet budget-friendly option for their wedding.

  * ### The Perfect Day at the Perfect Place

•Verified review

•Monica S.•Oct 20, 2025

My husband and I couldn’t have chosen a more perfect place to celebrate our wedding than Fairview Napa, CA. Our August 2025 wedding was everything we hoped for and more. From start to finish, the entire process was seamless and enjoyable. Valerie and Briana were incredibly supportive and patient, always quick to answer our questions and guide us every step of the way. Oscar was equally wonderful—kind, attentive, and informative. The entire team truly went above and beyond to make our vision come to life. Walking into the venue on the day of our wedding was such a breathtaking moment. Every detail we had discussed was brought to life beautifully—it was even better than we imagined. The team was so attentive, making sure we had drinks to stay hydrated and appetizers so we could actually enjoy a bite before the festivities began. Throughout the evening, everything ran flawlessly thanks to their professional coordination. We especially loved the open windows framing the gorgeous sunset—it added such a whimsical, romantic touch. The elegant draping created a warm, inviting atmosphere that tied everything together perfectly. Our wedding night was truly the best night of our lives, and we wouldn’t change a single thing. We are endlessly grateful to the entire Fairview team for creating such a beautiful, memorable experience. If we could, we’d do it all over again in a heartbeat.

  * ### Happy married people

•Verified review

•Chelsea G.•Sep 22, 2025

Fairview Napa was a wonderful choice for our wedding venue. From the start, their communication was quick, responsive, and concise, making the planning process smooth and stress-free. The venue itself was beautiful, and we loved being able to have our ceremony and reception outdoors - it really fit our vision perfectly. The staff was amazing and helped execute our event flawlessly. The only downside was that while Fairview Napa is an all-inclusive venue, the included vendors for things like the florals and cake were not up to the quality we were hoping for, so we had to upgrade those services, which is extra money. I highly recommend their DJ and Officiant services, they helped contribute to making the day extra special. After upgrading services, we were also very pleased with the florist and the aesthetics of the cake! Overall though, the value was great and we wouldn't hesitate to recommend Fairview Napa to any couple looking for a stunning Napa wedding location. Special shout out to Valerie, our wedding coordinator, who worked with us the entire planning process. She is great at her job and her years of experience shine through!
