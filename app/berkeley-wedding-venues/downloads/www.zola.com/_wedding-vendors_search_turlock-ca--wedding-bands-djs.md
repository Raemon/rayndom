Before the wedding he made sure to ask if we wanted specific songs for different parts of the ceremony and reception. We didn’t have a ton of specific songs, but we made a list of music with the vibes we wanted. Manny took the list, ran with it, and really took care of us. The dance floor was packed all night! He even played Tagalog pop songs and managed sound for a Filipino folk dance group. We also loved the little details like the template for our photo booth photos, the lights for the dance floor, and our initials projected on the wall. Thank you Bay Pro DJs, we’re so glad that you were there to help make our wedding so special.”Kristine B., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/bay-pro-djs-and-photo-booth-rental)

I can't imagine a better DJ, truly. When we first met with Jamie, he said he could make people dance to anything and would keep people on the dance floor all night, and he WAS NOT LYING. The whole night, the dance floor was PACKED even though it was rainy/muddy/cold/wet. Jamie took us on a journey that covered all of the bases of the music we love to hear and dance to, seamlessly and magically (?) integrating genres with the best mixes, it was pure wizardry and really captured who we were. We as a couple care a lot about music and wanted music that represented who we were and what we like to listen to, and he did not disappoint! So much prep work went into this, he took patience and time to try to understand our tastes and vibe, and it was so cool to have the wedding played on vinyl- basically, Jamie just "got it" from start to finish and we had the best time! Our wedding also got delayed due to rain and a road closure and he was such a good sport, staying late to keep us all dancing for a whole other hour- so fun! Also, when our ceremony musician was stuck in traffic due to the storm, he was so prepared and had our prelude/processional music downloaded so we could still walk down the aisle to the songs we'd chosen. Overall, such a cool, kind, funny guy who was professional and prepared in every way and honest just takes time to meet and know his clients, and clearly just loves to share his love of music. I would book him for everything if I could. BOOK THIS DJ. You will NOT regret it!”Madison C., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/021cb670-9b1b-4f20-aba5-9c86906519e5?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/ceremony-djs)

However, even after going through the work of submitting a Spotify play list and adding do not play songs or DJ played the wrong version of our first dance song (I checked and we had the correct version listed on our playlist we sent over), he also played songs from our do not play list to the point I, the bride, came over to ask if he had the wrong list. He admitted he was using songs from the do not play list as he was not paying attention. I would also like to note, though our wedding was more casual, our DJ was dressed in a sloppy manner. His shirt was half untucked from his pants, there were stains on his shirt and pants. Besides a few hiccups, direct Entertainment was wonderful to work with!”Courtney W., 4 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/23dbe01c-4b26-4a53-add3-8b7afdfeef14?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/direct-entertainment)

Joey is a true professional on all levels! From start to finish, communication was effortless and always on point. He even assisted us with setting up and dialing in the sound system. Now on to the important stuff... Cello Joe's performance bridged the spectrum of family and friends present for our wedding. It was such a magical experience seeing so many loved ones getting down to veggie maniac, bike girl and so much love :). Cello Joe delivered a performance that brought joy and smiles to everyone's experience. Overall I rate our experience 11/11. It was an honor to have such a talented musician perform and such a fun character to hang out with the rest of the event. Cello Joe's set was the musical highlight of our wedding.

He worked flawlessly with me, my partner, and our wedding planner to pull off an incredibly fun reception. Richard did an initial call with my partner to discuss the general vibe we were looking for, and we knew immediately he would be a great fit for our wedding. Richard gave us a helpful questionnaire to fill out key songs and general musical interests (and do not play songs). Richard was also happy to jump on calls with us to talk through our questions and hopes for our big day. I especially appreciated that Richard was able to play some German songs for some guests who had flown in from Germany, as that got even some of our older relatives on the dance floor. People were partying all night thanks to Richard! Richard catered to our wide age range of guests, and even gave us a couple of bonus closing songs that were the perfect conclusion to the night. We could not have asked for a better DJ.”Chelsea P., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/4115ccdf-dcf7-4cb9-8ac6-65414450fe8a?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/all-ears-dj)

From our initial phone call with Meredith, we knew we were in excellent hands. She took the time to thoroughly understand our vision and musical tastes, making thoughtful suggestions along the way. Communication was prompt, fun, and Meredith was so approachable throughout the planning process. On the big day, the band blew us away with their incredible talent and ability to perfectly execute our song requests, from jazz to oldies to classic rock. As musicians ourselves, we were so impressed by their skill level and experience and professionalism. During cocktail hour, two musicians played jazz, then they switched to rock mode for the reception. They truly made it feel like our own personal concert and kept people on the dance floor for literally 3 hours! The energy was palpable from their very first note, and their song selections kept guests of all ages dancing all night long. They ended the evening with “Purple Rain” by Prince and it made my life. We can't recommend the Lucky Devils Band highly enough - they were total professionals and our biggest splurge, but SO worth it I’d do it a million times over!!”Holly, a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/ab7a736a-78c4-491f-bfe5-22c7c88c5e42?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-bands-djs/lucky-devils-band)
