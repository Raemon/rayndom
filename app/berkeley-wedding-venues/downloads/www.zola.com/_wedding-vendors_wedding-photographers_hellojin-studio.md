Hello, I am a wedding and portrait photographer/cinematographer in San Francisco Bay Area. My photography is documentary style that focus on capturing natural moments, and candid pictures. I truly believe that wedding is not only for the bride and groom, but also family members, relatives, and friends. Capturing the joy and touching moments, and tell a story through my images is my philosophy. I studied Cinema and Creative arts at San Francisco State University. I love wedding photography/cinematography for the festive atmosphere and the excitement that comes from spending time with couples on their big day.

As a wedding photographer, it is my job to take beautiful pictures of the wedding day, but it can be very stressful not only for bride and groom, but also for guests. My style is very low key, go with the flow of the wedding day, make bride and groom comfortable, and capture great moments.

## Frequently asked questions

5 Answers

Ask them a question

### How do you provide final images?

You will receive professionally edited images digitally, which means you will receive a link to watch online gallery, and download all the images.

### How many images can we expect to receive from our wedding?

Every wedding is different. Some have more events than others so it all depends, but typically, you will receive between 500 to 800 images for 8 hours wedding.

### Do we need to pay deposit to reserve our wedding date?

Yes, it will be a non refundable 50% of agreed price to reserve the date.

### How long usually take to receive all the photos

It will take about a month after the wedding. It can take little more time in busy seasons, but I do my best to deliver all the images within 1-2 month time period.

### Ok, we decided to hire you as our wedding photographer, what is next?

Once you decided to hire me as a photographer, we can meet up or Zoom meeting at your convenience and discuss more about your wedding day. Having a meeting is always good thing because this way, we properly introduce ourselves, get to know little bit more each others, and get comfortable before the wedding day. After we discuss about the wedding day, and what packages to choose, we sign our contract.
