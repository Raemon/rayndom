  * ### Elegant and timeless experience

•Verified review

•Cécile E.•Dec 23, 2025

The Terrace Room was the perfect venue for our wedding day. From the very beginning, the staff, especially Candi and Bryon, were friendly, simple, quick, and incredibly helpful in planning our wedding all the way from Paris. They gave us great tips on vendors that really helped make our day magical. The venue itself is beautiful, with a lovely art deco style that felt elegant and unique. Our guests raved about the gorgeous space, the friendly staff (bar tenders, ...), and how well everything came together to make our wedding day truly perfect. We couldn't be happier with The Terrace Room and highly recommend it to any couple looking for a stunning, stress-free wedding experience.

  * ### Dream Wedding Come True!

•Verified review

•Mahogany S.•Oct 18, 2025

We couldn't have asked for a more perfect venue than The Terrace Room for our wedding day. From the moment we stepped into the space, we were captivated by its classic elegance, sweeping views of Lake Merritt, and the warm, welcoming atmosphere that made us feel instantly at ease. The historic charm of the art deco architecture paired beautifully with the modern amenities it truly felt timeless and sophisticated. The natural light streaming in through the large windows added a magical touch to our reception, and our guests are still raving about how stunning everything looked! The food was absolutely delicious far beyond typical "wedding food" expectations and the service was top-notch. Every guest felt taken care of, which meant the world to us. If you're looking for a venue that's not only visually breathtaking but also run by a professional and passionate team, look no further than The Terrace Room. It was the perfect place to begin our married life, and we’ll treasure the memories forever.

  * ### Oakland Wedding of Our Dreams

•Verified review

•Dominique V.•Jun 24, 2022

We will forever remember our gorgeous Oakland wedding at the Terrace Room. This venue highlights the beauty of Oakland, especially at night. It’s absolutely stunning. Candi (the event coordinator) was super sweet and worked with us faithfully, even through two COVID-19 postponements. After hearing about all the horrors couples went through with unaccommodating venues, Terrace Room made it easy to stick it out with them to have the wedding we originally wanted. Their food is fantastic as well! We keep getting compliments on it from our guests to this day. Choosing Terrace Room meant knocking out many to-do’s off our wedding planning list, as they provide a lot of services in their pricing. Speaking of price, this place can’t be beat. You get a lot for your money. Take a look at their preferred vendor list as well, they have some winners! Thank you eternally to Candi and Terrace Room for hosting the most beautiful night of our lives.
