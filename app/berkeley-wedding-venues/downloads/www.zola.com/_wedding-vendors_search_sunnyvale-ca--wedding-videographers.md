From the first phone call I knew he was the right fit for the day. His communication was excellent and he was just so easy to work with. He also worked so well with our other vendors everyone thought our photographer and him were colleagues. It’s the small little touches and he was able to offer us a book that plays our wedding video that we can keep on the coffee table to look back on anytime.

We're all about creating a seamless, genuine experience for you, one that feels easy, natural, and true to your story.

Our goal isn't just to give back memories that you'll cherish for a lifetime, we want you to feel your wedding all over again every time you look back.“We had the absolute best experience working with Yaro. From the moment we started filming, he made us feel so comfortable and relaxed — which says a lot because being on camera can feel awkward! He’s so much fun to work with, incredibly professional, and clearly very experienced at what he does. Yaro filmed videos for our engagement shoot and wedding day, and the videos came out beautifully, capturing every moment exactly the way we envisioned. He has an incredible eye for detail and storytelling, and everything felt natural, not forced — truly exactly what we wanted and more. The end result was nothing short of amazing. We are so grateful we chose Yaro and highly recommend him to any couple looking for a talented and reliable videographer.”Lolita N., 7 days ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-videographers/salt-and-snow-films)

Our team members are skilled, knowledgable, friendly, and creative individuals who work together to capture, edit, and deliver high quality content for every bride and groom.“There was no doubt in our minds when we chose Ivory Sky Media. We came across their videos on their blog and Vimeo, and fell in love with their style. Right when I got into contact with Allen, I felt so comfortable working with him. He was friendly, and quick to reply with our messages. Their prices and services were straight forward, nothing complicated, and very reasonably priced! Allen even gave me a discount (Facebook code). For our wedding, we had 3 videographers: Allen, Jennifer, and Frank. They were shooting all different kinds of angles, they even had a drone. How awesome!! The first time I met them, they were so friendly. Especially Allen, he was so genuinely kind-hearted, and even while we were getting ready, they were all so patient and nice with everyone. However, traffic held them back about an hour, but it was OK since we were kind of running behind schedule. Because of this, Allen was kind enough to refund me the extra 1 hour I paid for. How nice of him! The wedding video came in the mail as 2 BluRay discs, with customized cases. The entire video was amazing!! Previously, the editor had sent us a questionnaire that provided them an idea of our favorite songs and what style we wanted. All the songs they chose were so perfect!! The shots they took were beautiful, the drone shots were amazing! Then the highlight video was done and even that was also so perfect! Literally chose the perfect songs, songs we didn't even know much people liked or knew about, but these songs were all about us. It represented us so well as a couple. Overall, Allen and his crew at Ivory Sky Media were amazing! Highly recommended! Thank you!!”Eva, 4 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-videographers/ivory-sky-media)

My passion for photography and videography all started in a darkroom I built in a closet under the stairs as a high school student. I loved the idea of composing an image within the frame and then watching the photograph materialize like magic before my eyes in the wash of chemicals. When I was 18, my dad bought our family’s first video camera. I was immediately fascinated with the new possibility of capturing moving images, and what I could further create with this tool. Intrigued by all the ways I could retell a story with not only still frames, but though an array of motions and sounds woven together. BMP has captured memories since 2003.](/wedding-vendors/wedding-videographers/blue-moon-productions)

Truly, they were all were amazing. From start to finish, Flower Oak Films made us feel so cared for. They were so helpful throughout the whole process and so incredibly prompt in returning our film, but more than anything, they captured our day with such tenderness and intention. Watching our video feels like reliving the magic all over again. The emotions, the little moments, the parts we didn’t even realize we’d want to remember - they preserved them so beautifully. We’re beyond grateful for the gift they’ve given us.

Hi! Courtney here (that's me on the left!). Shutter and Sound is the brainchild of renowned wedding videographer Ryan Geldermann. Ryan began his wedding videography career in 2010 in Los Angeles and quickly became recognized as one of the top videographers in the U.S.. After relocating to DC and still receiving countless inquiries from all corners of the country, Ryan decided to recruit and train a few talented friends so he could continue offering the quality wedding videography he’s known for in SoCal and eventually over 10 cities. Shutter and Sound is a very small group of filmmakers dedicated to turning your big day into a work of art.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“I had the pleasure of working with Kaylee and Alexis as the planner for a wedding in South Georgia. These two are the dream video duo! Professional, fun, and incredibly talented. They captured the heart of the day so effortlessly and were a joy to have around. Their attention to detail and ability to preserve emotion through film is simply incredible.

I’m Colin Pattison, owner and filmmaker at Featherstone Wedding Films. I film weddings because I believe in the power of marriage, and I have a passion for capturing special moments on film. I’ve helped countless couples create their ideal wedding film for over 10 years. My goal is to capture lasting memories through beautiful, personalized wedding films. From first consultation, to finished film, I’ll be with you every step of the way.“Colin was probably one of the easiest vendors to work with. We chatted on the phone to get to know him, sent him our deposit and that was that! We talked a bit leading up to the wedding, but he and my photographer communicated to get on the same page/ timeline so I didn’t have to stress much about that either. The day of, him and his team were wonderful all day. They themselves were professional, and all his gear was as well. One of the things I appreciated most about Colin was his ability to be everywhere to get footage, but he was secretive about it, so those that are shy on camera didn’t feel pressured. My videos I got were AMAZING. I don’t know how many times we have watched the videos together or how many I’ve watched it alone but, every time feels like the first. It’s beautiful work and truly captured our wedding day and our personalities. We also got raw footage from him that had us cackling. It’s awesome seeing the day again through both the finished product and the raw footage. Thank you Colin for everything. I highly recommend Colin to everyone!!”Aubrey G., 9 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/d109b045-b058-4538-8d42-2fbbe8366a5b?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-videographers/featherstone-wedding-films)
