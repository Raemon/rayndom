From the moment we arrived, we were blown away by how stunning the space is—pictures truly don’t do it justice. Every corner feels like it’s been pulled from a fairytale. What made it even more special was meeting Sabrina, the new manager. She is warm, passionate, and incredibly detail-oriented. You can instantly feel how much she cares—not just about the venue, but about your vision and experience. She walked us through everything with so much enthusiasm and clarity that we left feeling completely confident and inspired. The new owners, Sabrina and Chase are not just maintaining the beauty of the venue—they're investing in thoughtful, meaningful upgrades that make the space even more magical. From landscaping to layout improvements, it’s clear they want every inch of the venue to feel perfect for their couples. We feel so lucky to have found this place and to be working with such a dedicated, and talented team. If you're considering this venue—don’t hesitate. You’ll be in the best hands!!”Samira M., 9 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-hanford-garden)

![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We toured Scribner Bend last November as a wedding venue option and immediately fell in love with the venue!!! We were looking for a venue that was intimate yet romantic and this venue checked off all of our boxes. The romantic, garden-esque setting is absolutely stunning and was everything we dreamed of for our wedding. From start to finish, working with the Scribner Bend team was such a breeze and truly made wedding planning fun and stress free. When we first booked, Shaye was the wedding facilitator and she was absolutely fantastic to work with. Later, we got to work with Hillary, their new wedding facilitator and she was just as amazing! So attentive, quick to answer questions and always accommodating of any last-minute requests. They really have such a well-oiled team and their amazing list of preferred vendors made the entire process seamless. We were married on a Friday which meant we had the wonderful bonus of hosting our rehearsal and rehearsal dinner at Scribner the night before. It was such a fun, easy experience and set the tone for the big day. Paesanos, their in-house caterer was fantastic (separate review) and they provided us with delicious wood-fired pizzas and two salads for our rehearsal dinner. All of our guests were raving about how good it was!! On our wedding day, we had access to the Bungalow for getting ready and wow!! it is such a beautiful, charming space. My bridesmaids and I loved spending the morning there. It has two make up stations that had great natural lighting and is great for making tiktoks! The guys had the Airstream, which was really unique and fun, though on our 100-degree wedding day it was a bit stuffy since the AC couldn't quite keep up (which is understandable for an Airstream!). Still, it was a cool and memorable space for them to get ready in. I cannot rave about Scribner Bend enough. The grounds are gorgeous, the staff is phenomenal and they truly helped create the most magical and smooth wedding day for us. I'd highly recommend this venue to anyone looking for a romantic, beautiful and well-supported place to say I do!!!!”Daphne J., 4 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/8eba7a95-c777-4ffa-9259-59bff2500b46?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/scribner-bend-vineyards)
