Pricing: $350/hr | Instagram: Lightfallimagery /// Hello! I’m Victoria and I specialize in wedding, proposal, and boudoir photography. I photograph people all over the world and I am a published photographer. I charge $350/hr or $2,800 for 8 hours with a free engagement or boudoir shoot. Add-ons to my packages can include videography and second shooters. Message me for more details!

I’m different than most photographers because I provide my couples with all of the photos I take. They then go through and choose which they want edited. So not only am I budget friendly, but my galleries are completely customized by my couples.

•Erin F.•Dec 14, 2025

Victoria did an AMAZING job! She handled the entire process very professionally and took some absolutely gorgeous photos. She is also super fun to be around and is a great person to get to spend your wedding day with! I think one of my favorite parts about her photography is her creativity and willingness to do whatever it takes to get epic photos. In our case, it was climbing up a cliff next to the ocean to get some gorgeous aerial shots. I highly highly highly recommend her!

Victoria was absolutely amazing. I’ve never had professional photos taken and my engagement shoot was my first time. She made me feel comfortable, beautiful and confident. My finance and I absolutely love how our photos turned out. She is an absolute artist!

Victoria picked a great location and made the shoot very fun and entertaining. She gave a lot of guidance for poses etc which made things pretty easy for me. The photos look fantastic. I would absolutely hire her again.

  * ### Must Hire! 

•Verified review

•Marisa•Oct 20, 2025

Our experience with Lightfall Imagery was fantastic from start to finish. Vic checked in with us in a timely manner throughout the planning process and was always open to our ideas, supporting our overall vision. On the day of the wedding, she was incredibly helpful, offering amazing prompting and direction to help us feel comfortable and natural in front of the camera. She truly went above and beyond, capturing every special moment we wanted and finding the most beautiful spots around our venue to get creative shots. We felt so at ease working with her. You absolutely have to book with her! 100/10 experience!

## Frequently asked questions

5 Answers

Ask them a question

### What services do you offer?

I’m a wedding photographer based in the San Francisco Bay Area. I am very flexible and provide several types of photography (I’m open to trying new things!) but my main focus is on weddings, engagements, proposals, and boudoir photography.

### What makes you unique?

I offer my couples a very customized experience and I’m budget friendly! I provide all photos taken during the shoot and allow my couples to choose which photos they want edited.

### Why should I hire you?

You should hire me because you like my style, I’m within your budget, and we have a good connection. You should also hire me because you trust me and want amazing photos of your big day!

### Tell us a little bit about yourself

My name is Victoria but I go by Vic. I grew up in Upstate New York and have lived all over the US. I’m a major traveler and my goal is to visit every country at some point. I have been interested in photography since I was a kid and started doing photography professionally about six years ago. I have a cat who I adore and I have a whole greenhouse of plants in my apartment at this point.

### What is your turnaround time and how do you deliver images?

My turnaround time is typically 3-4 weeks for fill 8 hour wedding days. For engagement shoots it is closer to 2 weeks. I deliver photos through an online gallery that allows my clients to order prints, perform different Ai searches to find photos of a specific family member, and more. All photos can be downloaded and my contract allows personal usage rights which includes printing.
