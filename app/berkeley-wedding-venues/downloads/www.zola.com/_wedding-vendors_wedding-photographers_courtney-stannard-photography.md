I have studied fine art photography long before I ever started taking portraits of other people and shooting weddings. Fine art photography was my beginning, creating conceptual and authentic art that spoke to me and told my story was what I started with and then I started blurring that line between fine art and documentary. I started documenting other people and their lives in the same way that I created my own work intended for shows and galleries. That is how I came to the style that I shoot now, still blending the two parts of my life.

I know it sounds ridiculously cliche but damn, my life has ALWAYS been about art! I received an art scholarship grant at high school graduation then I got two degrees in fine art and studio art, working in art galleries, screen printing factories and wedding venues along the way. I have traveled for artist residencies and for fun, visiting art galleries and meeting amazing people - these have all impacted the person I am today. The places I've been, the art I've seen, the people I've met (both good and bad), the side jobs, the late nights studying... it has all brought me here today.

## Frequently asked questions

6 Answers

Ask them a question

### How many weddings have you shot?

I have shot 30+ weddings and elopements so I am very well versed in the wedding world! I also used to work for a wedding venue as a dining room manager, my mom was an event planner AND my husband did audio for wedding ceremonies..... so not to say I know everything but like... I know everything about this HAHAH

### How will we receive our photos?

I will send you a beautiful online gallery that you will be able to share with friends and family. You will be able to download all of your high resolution photos from this gallery directly to whatever device you're using. Prints and products are available to purchase through this website as well or you can download the images and take them to get printed at a location of your choosing.

### I'm not sure I need an engagement session, will I get a discount if I opt out of it?

Engagement sessions are complimentary so opting out will not lower a package price. However, I fully believe that you can NEVER have enough pictures so do the dang session and bring your freaking dog.

### I am not familiar with the area, how will I know where I want to have my session?

I got you covered ;) You will receive a location guide made by yours truly that will give you multiple options for locations. Included will be photos, description, address, highlights, cons and any parking fees. You don't have to choose any of these locations if you don't love them but it is helpful to get a feel for what you're looking for.

### What if I hire you and then I don't really like you as a person and don't feel comfortable at my session?

I like to avoid this issue altogether by doing a facetime or zoom call before you book me! If we don't vibe, chances are that I won't be getting those amazing shots of you that you're looking for and we won't be a good fit so let's figure that out before you invest in me!

### How many photos will I get?

Sessions and weddings will differ in that answer. Weddings are so jam packed with moments, events and so many people that I aim for a minimum of 50 photos per hour that I am there for your wedding. When it comes to sessions, I aim for 30-40 images for a one hour session.
