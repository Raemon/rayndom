## Wedding Budget Questions

_A deeper look into all the decisions – what’s important, what’s tossed, and more._

### How did you decide on your [original wedding budget](https://www.zola.com/expert-advice/how-to-set-your-wedding-budget)?

My parents told me what they could afford.

### Once you decided on a set budget, did you actively attempt to stick to it?

I tried to stick to it but realized my parents had not had a wedding for 25 years.

### Top Three Priorities:

  1. **Decor** \- so I could fancy up the barn
  2. **My dress** \- so I could look and feel great on my wedding day
  3. **Photographer** \- my pictures look amazing and so fancy even though our wedding was in a barn
  4. Bonus: **Open bar** \- so my family would show up lol.



### Bottom Three Priorities:

  1. **Florals** \- Fake floral looks just as good
  2. **DJ** \- as long as they had the equipment I didn’t really care if they just played a Spotify playlist
  3. **Venue** \- I knew I wanted to do it at my parents' house since it overlooks the lake and is free



### Did you hire a [wedding planner](https://www.zola.com/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners)?

Yes - I had a friend from high school who has since started her own business. She was amazing. Since we had the event at my parents' house we had to start from scratch. She set up all my tables, decor, Photo Booth, and ceremony sight and I overall just felt a lot less stressed knowing she was taking care of everything since I didn’t have a venue coordinator.

### What, if any, were the main budgeting challenges you faced?

As a teacher, I don’t make much so we had to really decide how much we as a couple could spend. Most of my budget went towards my makeup person, my bridesmaid gifts since I had 13, and giving gift cards to my friends and family who helped out

### Did you need to cut anything to stick to your budget?

A fully open bar.

### What did you add that resulted in you [going over your budget](https://www.zola.com/expert-advice/gone-over-budget-what-to-do)?

A makeup artist for me and my maid of honor, a day of coordinator.

### What, if any, fun extras did you throw in while planning that you didn’t originally budget for?

We did a photo booth and mason jars with stickers on them with our names and wedding date (those were also our party favors).

### What did you find to be the most effective way to save money for/on your wedding?

We had a huge wedding with 200 people, so the fact that we kept it so low is impressive. The biggest expense was the venue and florals for most people so that is why we chose my parents' house and to rent fake florals.

### Did you think at all about or prepare for your [newlywed financial future](https://www.zola.com/expert-advice/life-insurance-for-spouses) while you budgeted for your wedding?

No we did not.

### What is something you didn’t buy that you wish you did for the wedding?

Honestly, I got everything I wanted on my wedding day.

### What wedding expenses surprised you the most?

Photography for sure.

### What is the weirdest or most out-of-the-box thing you bought for your wedding?

My parents-in-law rented out an entire restaurant for our rehearsal dinner since we had an out-of-town wedding. It was the pre-wedding.

### Any other details you want to share?

Money was tight for sure but we still had a beautiful wedding and I am lucky I had friends and family to help me out with several things like officiant, hair, makeup, desserts and wedding cake, and venue. Everyone really came together for us and provided services as a wedding gift.
