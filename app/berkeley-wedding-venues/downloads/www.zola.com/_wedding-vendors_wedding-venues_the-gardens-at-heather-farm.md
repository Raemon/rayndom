  * ### Beautiful Venue & Fantastic Staff

•Verified review

•Mackenzie W.•Sep 27, 2025

Our venue was everything we could have hoped for and more. The team was incredibly accommodating and made the entire day-of experience effortless—we truly felt taken care of from start to finish. The space itself was the perfect backdrop for every part of our wedding, from the garden ceremony to the indoor reception, and created such a beautiful atmosphere for our guests. We couldn’t have asked for a better place to celebrate our wedding. Highly recommend to any couple looking for a venue that combines stunning surroundings with excellent service!

  * ### Great Blank Canvas Venue

•Verified review

•Crystal Y.•Sep 24, 2025

The Gardens At Heather Farm was a wonderful choice for our wedding venue. Their communication via email was always prompt and responsive, which made coordinating the event a breeze. The venue itself is stunning, with over 4 acres of beautifully landscaped gardens and a gazebo that provided a picturesque backdrop for our ceremony and reception. There were still flowers in bloom in the garden areas in September. The tables and chairs were already laid out for both the ceremony and reception areas upon arrival, taking one more detail off our plate on the big day. They also allow you to bring your own alcohol, provided it is served by licensed bartenders. We would highly recommend The Gardens At Heather Farm to any couple looking for a serene, natural setting for their wedding.

•Ashlee K.•Apr 14, 2025

I hosted a surprise birthday party for my husband at The Gardens in March 2025. The booking process was smooth and seamless and I had a great experience with several of their recommended vendors including Elisa's catering. The venue and event staff were extremely flexible and answered my questions quickly. My event was beautiful and the venue allowed our guests to enjoy the beautiful scenery as well as celebrate my husband's birthday. I highly recommend The Gardens at Heather Farm for any event you are hosting, large or small.

•Chloe S.•Oct 27, 2024

The gardens at Heather farms was everything we were looking for in a venue. We wanted outdoors with lots of plant life, a reception space that was not a barn, fairytale vibes, ability to choose our own vendors, have a full bar, plenty of time at the venue to have the day of our dreams, and LGBTQ friendly. The gardens delivered all of this and was well within our budget. As a lesbian couple it was very important to us to find a venue and vendors that felt like supportive allies and from our first meeting with GHF we felt very welcome. We also loved that the only vendor they had a preferred list for was catering (the list had many great options and we were very happy with our choice), this allowed us to ensure that all of our other vendors we hired were also allies or members of the queer community. They were great to work with and everything went so smooth the day-of. It was also stunning, the rose gardens feel so magical and I loved that we didn’t need to worry about much decor for the ceremony space. Everything was beautifully in bloom even in mid-October. If I could go back and do it over again I would still choose to get married at the gardens in a heartbeat! Another thing we love is that it’s open to the public when it is not closed for private events, so leading up to our wedding we spent a lot of time visiting just because! We took my mom there for a Mother’s Day picnic and also went with friends. I can’t wait to return as newlyweds again and again.

## Frequently asked questions

17 Answers

Ask them a question

### What is included in my wedding rental package?

In addition to the venue space(s), we provide tables and chairs (some restrictions apply) and an event attendant to assist with facility needs on your wedding day. Catering, bar service, linens, tableware, photography, lighting, flowers, entertainment and officiant services are provided by other vendors.

### Can we set up early (before rental time starts)?

No. You may only set up during your designated rental time.

### Can we store decorations, supplies, furniture, etc. at the Gardens for our wedding when we are not on site?

You may only store items at the Gardens during your rental time. You may not bring items in prior to your rental, or leave items for pick up after your rental.

### Do we get time for the rehearsal?

Yes. A one-hour rehearsal (usually a few days before the event) is included in your rental as a courtesy. However, our staff is not involved in the rehearsal; it is solely managed by the renter and is to be held in the outdoor spaces only while the garden is open to the public (the building is not available for rehearsals).

### Do you have rooms for the bride and groom to get ready before the ceremony?

Yes. There is an additional classroom-style space on the lower floor called the Rose Room which can be rented for an additional fee.

### Can we put décor up on the Gazebo for the ceremony?

No. Since it is a local landmark and work of art, it is important to us to preserve the visual and physical integrity of the Gazebo. As such, we prohibit any decorations to be placed on or attached to the Gazebo surface and structures. Decorations are also prohibited on the plant life (trees, rose bushes, hedges, etc.).

### Why are we not allowed to throw birdseed, rose petals, glitter, etc. indoors or outdoors?

As a nature-based nonprofit, Certified Green Business and Wildlife Habitat, it’s important to us to protect both our property and the environment. We do not allow throwing of materials such as synthetic flower petals, rice, birdseed, or confetti. We allow bubbles and real petals. We also do not allow these types of materials indoors because they get into tight spaces in our floors and furniture and are difficult to remove.

### Is there an indoor option for when it rains?

Yes. In the event of bad weather, ceremonies can be held in the Camellia Room. Guests are seated at the banquet tables and the couple stands in front of the large picture windows overlooking our gardens.

### Can we have our reception outdoors, e.g. on the Meadow Lawn?

Yes, however, tables and chairs for receptions are NOT included in your venue rental. You must provide your own tables and chairs for this area, which you may do through a party equipment vendor (see our list of recommendations). This area is not shaded or sheltered. Outdoor events are not permitted in the garden after dark and amplified music is not permitted outdoors after 8PM.

### Do you have Audio/Visual equipment for rentals to use?

No, we do not have AV equipment available for use at your wedding. You must provide your own.

### Can we bring in our own caterer?

Yes! We allow clients to bring in a full-service, licensed and professional catering service. GHF must pre-approve any catering service before you contract with them.

### Can we have amplified music outdoors?

Yes, however, amplified music may not be played outdoors past 8PM and should not be heard more than 50 feet from the venue, as our facilities are adjacent to a residential neighborhood. Most wedding receptions at our venue take place indoors where amplified music is permitted up to one hour before the end of your rental.

### Can we bring in our own food?

No, you cannot provide your own food for your event. All food service must come from the professional, licensed caterer selected and approved for your event. The only exception to this rule is the wedding cake/dessert.

### Can we pay an additional fee to stay past curfew time of 10 p.m./12 a.m.?

No. The Gardens at Heather Farm is adjacent to a neighborhood and due to noise ordinances, we must close our facility at the designated times.

### Can we bring our own alcohol?

All alcohol must be served by a bartender from designated bar areas; alcohol can never be self-serve to the guest. Bartenders are required to provide insurance and business documents prior to your event.

### Do you have on-site parking?

Yes, all parking is self-parking. We also have four handicap designated spaces. All cars must be removed by the end of the rental period.

### Do you have accessible facilities?

Yes, all our facilities are wheelchair accessible.
