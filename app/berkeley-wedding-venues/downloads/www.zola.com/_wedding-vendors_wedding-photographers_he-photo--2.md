Hi, I’m Hayden! With over 300 weddings captured, I take a journalistic approach to photography, documenting authentic moments as they naturally unfold. I shoot with both film and digital to create timeless, heartfelt images that tell your unique love story. With a go-with-the-flow mentality, I will capture moments as they come and turn them into beautiful memories.

I bring experience and adaptability to your wedding. My journalistic approach allows me to document moments as they naturally unfold, creating a collection of images that feel authentic and timeless. Blending the nostalgia of film with the versatility of digital to craft a unique visual story. I thrive in the unpredictability of wedding days—whether it's a last-minute timeline change or an unexpected rain shower, I embrace the moment and capture the beauty in it. My goal is to seamlessly blend into the day, allowing couples to be fully present while I document their love story.

  * ### Excellent Photographer - Went Above and Beyond

•Verified review

•Austin•Jun 5, 2025

Hayden was absolutely fantastic! Not only did he bring his own camera and film to contribute to the retro vibe of our wedding (photo attached), he worked perfectly with our friend and videographer to get some incredible shots of my wife and I. His demeanor and humor made it so much easier and more fun to take photos and really set us at ease. He posed us in such a natural way that didn’t feel awkward at all and the photos were absolutely stunning. To top it all off, he saw my groomsmen and I setting up chairs for the ceremony and he pitched in to help us carry them! I cannot recommend him enough, he’s the man.

  * ### Best Wedding Photographer!

•Verified review

•Jessica W.•Mar 31, 2025

Hayden was amazing! From the start he was super attentive to our requests and questions. We clicked with him right away. My now husband is not much of a picture-taker. Hayden put him at ease for our engagement photos and it made it that much easier on the day of our wedding. I also appreciated Hayden's enthusiasm for unique poses and shots throughout our wedding. We wanted to be photographed in the tree we got married in front of and Hayden helped make it happen! 10 out of 10 recommendation!

  * ### Film wedding king 

•Verified review

•Thomas S.•Mar 27, 2025

Hayden & I work together often as each others second photographers often, he and I have shot well over 60 weddings together. Out of all the photographers Ive worked with Hayden is no doubt the best and the one I would trust with any wedding any day. He even photographed parts of my wedding day and they are some of my favorite photos from the day.

  * ### The Photographer who will make you laugh

•Verified review

•Alyssa Y.•Mar 22, 2025

Hayden is an amazing photographer, and a stand out vendor to work with. I met Hayden about 5 minutes before we started working together, but everyone around us thought we knew each other beforehand from how easily we worked with one another. He was the photographer and I was the wedding content creator. He was extremely courteous and always made sure I got the shots I needed. I helped him with his vision and he added onto mine. Hayden made the day so easy for me as a vendor, and he kept the bride and groom smiling in each shot with his funny dad jokes. I HIGHLY recommend Hayden as your wedding day photographer, and hope I have the chance to work with him again as a vendor!

## Frequently asked questions

4 Answers

Ask them a question

### How many pictures will we get?

You can expect about 80 to 100 images per hour of photographing. But keep in mind this estimate varies depending on your wedding package, number of guests, venue type, and other factors.

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

My turnaround time varies by season. Typically, you’ll be able to view your photos online about 1-3 weeks after your wedding. Within this time frame, you can also expect to receive a link directly to all of your files, so you can share the photos with your loved ones with one click.

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

I accept bookings of any time frame; one week to one year it doesn't matter to me.

### Do you have insurance?

I do! Just let me know if your venue requires a certificate of liability, and I’ll send that over to them.
