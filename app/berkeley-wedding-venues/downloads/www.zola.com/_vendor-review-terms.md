Vendor Reviews consist of opinions, photos and other information submitted by users about Vendors as well the responses submitted by such Vendors. You may submit a Vendor Review if and only if you meet the qualifications listed below.

You may be required to verify your identity in order to submit your Vendor Review.

  * **Clients:** You were a client of the applicable Vendor, the Vendor-client relationship was entered into pursuant to a bona fide, signed contract and the event for which you engaged the applicable Vendor occurred within four (4) years prior to the date on which you are submitting the Vendor Review; provided, that, for purposes of these Vendor Review Terms and Conditions, you will also be considered a “client” of the applicable Vendor if another individual entered into such contract on your behalf and you were a principal beneficiary of the Vendor’s services.
