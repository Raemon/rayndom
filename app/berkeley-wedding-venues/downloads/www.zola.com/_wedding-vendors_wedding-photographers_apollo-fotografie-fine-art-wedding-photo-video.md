  * ### Stop Scrolling, Book Apollo. Best Decision We Made

•Verified review

•Melissa T.•Jan 16

We absolutely recommend Apollo Fotografie. We had a fantastic experience from start to finish, from our very first call with Liv through our wedding day. Our main photographer, Jess, also photographed our engagement shoot, which gave us the chance to understand her style and build a relationship ahead of the wedding. This made the wedding day feel easy and natural. She made us feel incredibly comfortable, encouraged us to try new poses, and we fully trusted her with both our couples photos and family photos. We had a wonderful time working with Jess and Mikie on our wedding day. They really listened to what mattered most to us, including our photography preferences and emphasis on candid moments, while also bringing thoughtful professional recommendations that made us feel confident throughout the process. Jess absolutely crushed it. She was incredibly organized, struck the perfect balance between calm and guidance, and worked wonderfully with our families. Mikie was also fantastic and worked especially well with the groomsmen, keeping things moving and everyone on track. We are absolutely thrilled with how the photos turned out and truly love our wedding photos. If you are looking for a Bay Area wedding photographer, the Apollo Fotografie team is truly one of the best you can find.

  * ### Best Bay Area Wedding Photographer

•Verified review

•Casey and B.•Jan 13

Apollo did a fantastic job capturing our wedding in November in San Francisco. Andra and Melaina were with us every step of the way, capturing a full range of memories from posed portraits to candids with our guests to details of the venue. Our ceremony was indoors at night in low light, and Andra and Melaina worked with the lighting to create beautiful, dramatic pictures that we can’t wait to hang in our home. Apollo has tons of experience photographing weddings, and they have a very helpful structured process to follow in advance of the wedding day to ensure everything runs smoothly. As a couple, we aren’t super comfortable in front of a camera, but Andra and Melaina were helpful coaches and cheerleaders which made us much more at ease during the shoots. They also did a great job of planning for our venue and using their own artistic perspective to put us in locations that turned into amazing photos. If you’re looking for a great Bay Area wedding photographer, Apollo is an awesome choice!

  * ### Look no further, book Apollo!

•Verified review

•Leslie•Jan 12

Finding a wedding photographer took us longer than expected! We wanted to find a team that did photo and video for ease and alignment on our wedding day, with a skilled team we could trust, without blowing out budget. Apollo checked all these boxes and much more. The team is extremely professional, organized, and has a calming presence. Carie was our photographer and Alexa was our videographer. Liv is such a delight to work with too and delivered beautiful sneak peaks while we were on our honeymoon, the 700 photos timely after, our movie trailer, and ALL video footage the day before Christmas eve (we got married October 10th). I would recommend Apollo to all and feel they are they are the best bay area wedding photographer.

  * ### Best wedding photographer in San Francisco!

•Verified review

•Clarissa L.•Jan 10

We highly recommend Apollo Fotografie if you're looking for a Bay Area wedding photographer and videographer! In fact, we chose Apollo because we were so in love with the wedding photos they took for another couple at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco. From our very first inquiry to our big day, Liv was thorough, detail-oriented, and always made us feel taken care of. The email follow-ups and timeline reminders were impeccable! Our wedding photos and video are stunning!!! It's such a wonderful way to relive the memories. We're so grateful for Carrie and Jas (our wedding photographers) and Terrence (videographer) for capturing our special day. Everyone showed up on time and was professional. Carrie was very thoughtful in capturing the exact angles I had shared with her in my vision document, and Jas did a phenomenal job on our tea ceremony and getting-ready photos. Terrence captured an incredible drone shot of the Palace of Fine Arts, which was shared in the beginning of our wedding video. We love all the candid shots from our ceremony, reception and dance floor! Thank you Apollo Fotografie for making our wedding memories truly unforgettable!

## Frequently asked questions

5 Answers

Ask them a question

### What style of photography does your team shoot?

We use style & storytelling techniques to give your imagery a fine art feeling. The end result will be a mixture of crafted imagery with journalistic embellishments. For the portraits, we will guide you into incredible natural lighting with organic poses that create balanced compositions.

### Which wedding photographer photographed the images on your site?

The sample images you have seen throughout the website & in the extended galleries we sent out before your consultation were photographed by all of the San Francisco wedding photographers on the team. Because everyone shoots in the same style & technique & uses the same gear, we can ensure there is consistency between each wedding we photograph collectively.

### What service area do you cover?

We are San Francisco wedding photographers, first & foremost. However, we also travel all over the Bay Area including, but not limited to, Sacramento, San Jose, Carmel, Monterey, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, Napa & Sonoma Counties. We are also available for travel worldwide!

### How do we secure Jonathon as our wedding photographer?

Jonathon photographs the Model X collection from the photo pricing guide. For all other events, his associate team of San Francisco wedding photographers, who have been trained extensively in his style, photograph in his place based on Collection choice & their availability. They use the same cameras, same lenses, & the same technique on the wedding to ensure the style is consistent to the brand.

### Do you offer video as well as photo?

Yes we do! Our videographers and photographers are all familiar with each other, so there is an advantage to hiring Apollo to cover your event!
