  * ### Understood the assignment

•Verified review

•Shereese•Aug 3, 2024

I was truly in awe of how my event turned out. Donna of DBC Eventz INC. did an amazing job bringing the vision to life. Donna went above and beyond finding intricate items that went with the theme and thought outside the box with the decorations. The entire space was decorated beautifully from top to bottom. Donna understood the assignment and took it to the next level. Donna included me and kept me up to date on where she was with the status of my party. Donna even assisted me with finding the right person to make a cake, DJ the event and take pictures and videos at the event. I was able to have an entrance area, seat all my guest comfortably, have a dance floor, a bar and a separate food area. I will definitely be using DBC Eventz Inc. for my future events.

•Tena M.•Aug 2, 2024

Donna of DBC EVENTZ was very easy to work with despite my deciding to do a last minute event. The decor and venue styling was amazing. My guests had no idea that it wasn't planned in advance. DBC Eventz ensured that the vision I had for my event was executed perfectly. The draping was gorgeous and the extra touches that were essential to the beauty of the event were great. Donna knew the significance of the day for me and made sure that I was absolutely pleased. Thank you for the care you put into making my event special.
