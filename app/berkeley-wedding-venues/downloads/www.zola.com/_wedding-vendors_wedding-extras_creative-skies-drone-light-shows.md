  * ### What a fun add on to our wedding!

•Verified review

•Haroldo Ferraz N.•Jun 17, 2025

This was actually a surprise to my wife, Rodrigo and his team went beyond to make sure the surprise was kept a big secret! We had the drones right at the moment we were having our dance, and they were able to deliver and coordinate with the DJ EXACTLY the time I wanted... I was really an amazing way to show our story in the skies for everyone.

Response from vendor•Jun 17, 2025

Hey Haroldo, really appreciated your review! Thank you so much!

  * ### Amazing Show from Creative Skies team!

•Verified review

•Ronald W.•Jun 17, 2025

I actually used this company twice... First time when I had the craziest idea ever about proposing with a Drone light show by San Diego bay... Then, again at our weeding day! Rodrigo and David are extremely professional, and their team are always on time by the seconds, to make sure everything went accordingly as I needed. I def recommend it!

Response from vendor•Jun 17, 2025

## Frequently asked questions

6 Answers

Ask them a question

### Are drone light shows safe?

Yes — We operate with FAA-certified pilots with proper safety protocols. All of our shows includes airspace approvals, liability insurance (often $5M+), geo-fencing, and safety zones.

### Can drone shows replace fireworks?

Absolutely! Drone shows are quieter, eco-friendly, safer, and allow for customized visuals (logos, messages, 3D animations). They’re increasingly popular for events like July 4th, weddings, and festivals, but that can also add to fireworks shows.

### What’s the minimum number of drones for a show?

It's recommend a minimum of 100 drones to create a visually impactful show.

### How long does it take to prepare a drone light show?

Depending on complexity, it can take 2 to 6 weeks to storyboard, animate, get approvals, and rehearse. But, thats an easy streamlined process.

### How long does a drone show last?

The average drone show lasts between 10 to 15 minutes.

### Can you spell names, logos, or shapes in the sky?

Yes! Drones can form letters, logos, QR codes, hearts, wedding rings, animated characters, and more.
