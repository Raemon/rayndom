Sunshine Marriages was an excellent choice for our wedding officiant. From the start, their communication was clear, responsive, and respectful. They were incredibly organized and efficient in ensuring our ceremony ran smoothly. The officiant provided thoughtful ideas that helped make our wedding day special and personal. We appreciated their professionalism and attentiveness throughout the entire process. Sunshine Marriages played an integral role in making our wedding day perfect.

Response from vendor•Dec 19, 2025

Thank you so much, Fatima. You two were a joy to work with. Congratulations and wishing you two a lifetime of happiness :-)
