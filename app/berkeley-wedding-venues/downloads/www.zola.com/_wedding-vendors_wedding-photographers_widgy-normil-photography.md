I am a content creator/photographer. I specialized in Portraits (maternity, family, and couples), events (corporate, parties, etc.), and weddings (formal and elopements, destinations, courthouses, and so forth ). I am based in Lauderhill, Fl. I am known mostly for my unique natural skin tone portrait style

What sets me apart from others is that I make it my absolute duty to capture every moment of my client’s special day. Whether it is photo or video, we make sure I go above and beyond for all my clients.

•Ketena W.•Sep 20, 2025

Widgy Normil Photography was a dream to work with for our wedding day. Their communication style was easy, quick and understanding throughout the entire process. The quality of their work was crisp, showstopping and professional. Widgy came up with such amazing concepts to make all of our dream albums come to life. He was accommodating and also gave us great advice that really elevated our wedding photos. I especially appreciated the Instagram video edits he made for us - they captured the joy and energy of our special day perfectly. We couldn't be happier with the memories Widgy helped us create.

## Frequently asked questions

8 Answers

Ask them a question

### Do you also offer video services?

Yes, I have a team of in house videographers.

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

My turnaround time varies by season. Typically, you’ll be able to view your photos online about 4-12 weeks after your wedding. Within this time, you can also expect to receive a a set of high-resolution sneak peek files, so you can share the photos with your loved ones and on social media.

### Do you have insurance?

I do! Just let me know if your venue requires a certificate of liability, and I’ll send that over to them.

### What’s your back-up plan if you can’t photograph our wedding as planned?

In my 10 years of experience as a wedding photographer, I’ve never cancelled a booking. In the very rare event that I’m unable to photograph your wedding, I’ll make sure you’re covered by one of my colleagues or my contracted assistant. I’ll also provide you with a list of photographers from the many networking groups I’m in, so you can find the perfect replacement.

### Will you edit all our pictures?

Definitely. All final images will be edited for color, saturation, exposure, and sharpness to ensure they look beautiful. I also offer retouching services like blemish removal and teeth whitening for an additional charge.

### Do you work with assistants or other photographers?

Sometimes, I’ll bring one or more assistant photographers depending on the size of your wedding. Don’t worry, this won’t cost you extra.

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically, couples book me about 12-15 months before their wedding date. I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible about my availability, even if you’re planning on a shorter time frame.

### How many pictures will we get?

You can expect about 80 to 100 images per hour of photographing. But keep in mind this estimate varies depending on your wedding package, number of guests, venue type, and other factors.
