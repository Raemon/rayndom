  * ### THE BEST TEAM EVER

•Verified review

•Michelle B.•Sep 24, 2025

I got married 05/31/2025 and Yazmin made everything so easy and stress free. Gather Events made my dreams come true! From answering all of my questions, understanding my vision, complying to my requests. I couldn’t have asked for a better team to be there the day of my wedding. If I needed a specific item, either they had it or they found a way to get it for me. Will forever be my go to party rentals! The flowers also! So beautiful

  * ### Gorgeous, Convenient, Easy, everything & more

•Verified review

•Tanya S.•Jul 15, 2025

Absolutely amazing property which is a reflection of the hardworking family who owns it. Every corner of the property has been thoughtfully touched with multiple ceremony spaces, huge reception space and not to mention the gorgeous 3,000 sq ft house and additional grooms quarters. You need to see it to truly understand everything there is to offer. It's a one stop shop type of venue which makes it incredibly convenient and stress free.

•Verified review

•Nancy V.•Jul 7, 2025

Got the wonderful opportunity to get married here May 24th. Everything from meeting Yazmin and her family was such a joy! It was such a beautiful experience to watch this place grow into such a beautiful venue. It's a one-stop-shop! Food, decor, flowers, coordinator and many other things! Yazmin was such a joy to work with and made the process so easy. Everyone who works on the grounds are absolutely amazing and kind. The house is beautiful, clean and spacious. The view was amazing! Seeing the horses run around, the flowers in bloom, the water from the fountain and more was amazing!
