## Frequently asked questions

12 Answers

Ask them a question

### What is your peak season?

Although mother nature likes to surprise us sometimes, the best opportunity for a sunny wedding day will be from May until September.

### Can we bring our own alcohol?

Absolutely! You will need to have a insured bartender to serve it.

### Do you have accessible facilities?

Although we are an outdoor venue, we make every effort to assist those with mobility issues with our shuttle. We can drive those that need it to the ceremony chairs and then again to the reception area. The ground is not level, but we do have a wheelchair accessible restroom.

### Do you have on-site parking?

Yes, and our helpful staff is there to direct your guests to the best parking. We also have a small shuttle.

### How many hours are included in our booking?

Elite 3-Day Wedding Package: Friday 9:00 a.m. - 8:00 p.m. &Saturday 10:00 a.m. - 10:00 p.m. & Sunday 9:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.

### Do we need to get insurance?

Yes, we require event insurance with a minimum coverage of $1,000,000 with Host Liquor Liability listing, Indian Rock Tree Farm LLC, as the beneficiary, for all contracted days .

### Do you have a brochure you can send us?

Yes, please visit our website and click on Request Event Information. https://indianrocktreefarm.com/weddings/

### Do you require us to provide a Day-Of Wedding Coordinator?

Yes we do. We have hosted many weddings and have learned how critical it is to have a reliable person, that is not a part of the wedding party or a seated guest, to manage the day. If you do not have someone already chosen, we can recommend some amazing Coordinators or can provide one from our staff for a fee. IRTF Coordination Fee Schedule available upon request.

### Are we required to use vendors from your list?

No, you are contracting with your vendors. We maintain a list of local vendors as a courtesy and are happy to share it with you after you book.

### Do you allow live music or DJ?

Yes, we hope you bring music and dance the night away! El Dorado County has established decibel levels and we will work with your DJ to keep the volume within that range. Music must end at 10pm. by county code.

### What is your best advice for a newly married couple?

Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. 1 Corinthians 13:4-8

### What is your off-peak season?

As an operating Christmas Tree Farm, we do not host weddings from mid-October until after the rainy season which is usually the beginning of May.
