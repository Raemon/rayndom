“The Riverside Art Museum was an absolute pleasure to work with for a wedding I DJ for. Their communication style was caring, thoughtful, considerate, detailed, and professional throughout the first of contact til day of the wedding, and throughout. The quality of their work and the overall value they provided was truly impressive - the venue was elegant, with breathtaking views that made for a truly memorable setting. When the ceremony ran behind schedule do to the bride not present as of yet, the staff was incredibly accommodating. One thing I must note that I don't see to often. They stayed out of the way until all of the guests had departed before efficiently breaking down the space. It's shows their thoughts are on the couples having a great time up until the last minute and giving the guest time to exit. Not trying to clean up and break down around the guest just to get off sooner. Kisbel (Event Manager) and the entire team felt like close friends committed to making their friends special day a success! I couldn't have asked for a better wedding venue and staff to had worked with for the first time. Highly Recommended!”DJ Zest for R., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/934a15ee-f83b-468a-870a-49ebc62f945c?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-riverside-art-museum)

“From our venue tour to our tasting to our wedding day, Angie and the team at Colette’s and Muckenthaler Mansion were a dream to work with. They were communicative, clear, timely, and so helpful. It’s so convenient to have everything go through them, like tables, chairs, bar, staff, catering, linens, additional rentals, and cake. We were also able to bring in outside vendors like a photobooth and boba bar. We also used one of the rooms in the mansion to have a kids table with activities. This venue and catering were one of the most reasonably priced options, as well. We really felt like they were our cheerleaders doing everything they could to make our day smooth and memorable. Our guests could not stop raving about how beautiful the setting was. It’s great to be able to use any space on the property that you want, so we had each part of the night in a different space, which really made it feel cozy and homey like we were hosting a backyard garden reception and a party inside the mansion/gallery. We also felt great that the venue fee was a donation to the nonprofit cultural center. The food is delicious and the drinks were strong. The staff lead Anthony was at our beck and call all night, and thought of the tiniest details to enhance our experience. The bartender and servers were great too. I think everybody should get married here! The setting makes the day feel truly special and unique. And made a beautiful backdrop for photos. I can’t thank them enough!!”Sabrina P., 7 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/be2b6442-ebd4-4d7d-8f0f-08fe2ba160a9?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-muckenthaler-mansion)

“Adina and the Event Set crew transformed the GMMA into a beautiful wedding site and experience. We picked them because the price was right and the views were beautiful. On the day of the event the flowers were more grand than we expected for our price point, the DJ was engaging, and the food was better than any wedding I’ve attended. They accommodated our Indo-Western wedding with great Indian and western food. We even had his and hers mocktails. The food was the most customizable experience we found on the market. And it was tasty max. Adina is respectful, caring and patient. Your photos will be amazing with the view and the flowers. Especially if you have Trisha as your photographer. She is a master of lighting and angles. She makes quick work of editing and getting the photos back to you. Overall a great experience, less stress, and an all inclusive experience with lots of personalization.”Lauren, a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/058408dd-3a56-421c-b40f-262303db4ada?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-gray-matter-museum-of-art)

“Heritage Park and Clarke estate are two hidden gem venues I love telling future clients about along with friends and family. Working there as a preferred vendor for nearly 5 years now has been a great experience as a vendor and for my clients as well. Working together with a venue to ensure the couples day is going well without a hitch is very important and let me tell you Leanne and her staff consistently work together and hard to make sure of that. Not only are both venues historic they're also affordable. That is a perfect combination for a venue Especially when people need to accommodate large guests 200-300 guests. Highly recommend both venues I do work more at heritage Park since their guest capacity is 300 but I always look forward to working with Leanne. Always a great experience.”Cynthia Najares, 6 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/heritage-park)

“From our first look at pictures of this venue, we fell in love. The architecture and the history of this venue stand out compared to other venues we looked at, and the chance to support a non-profit with our wedding was an extra bonus. All the staff that helped us with everything from planning to the day of were wonderful and really helped the day go perfectly. Even with the threat of rain, we knew we had options for an indoor or a outdoor/indoor wedding. We also have to shout out their Preferred Vendors list as a great place to start building the rest of our wedding vendors.”Kelly S., 3 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-maxwell-house)

“This is the perfect reception venue. Nicola the event coordinator immediately called me after I submitted an inquiry and from then on her communication was amazing. The museum went out of their way (to include leaving up pieces of art that they knew we loved for our reception) to make our day so special. You need very minimum decorations because the art truly shines and the space is beautiful. The building is modern, which allowed for our own creativity like projecting large images on the outside, facing the street. Our guests raved about it and when not dancing or enjoying food were able to wander the galleries and even purchase some art! I was able to create a special space for kids to get creative as well. Of all the venues we toured the museum gave us the most flexibility and options and we’re very gracious about what vendors we could use allowing us to have a truly custom event that represented our lives and relationship. I am so thankful for the staff at OMA for making our experience so exceptional! Not only will you have a unique venue, but your money is going to support the arts and the local community of Oceanside!”Olivia, 7 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/dcd0b439-0b72-4266-a930-d0b64b275c46?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/oceanside-museum-of-art)

We are using Zola to promote our site as a rental venue for weddings and private events. To learn more, visit rental[dot]panoramaonview[dot]org and to ask questions or schedule a tour, contact event[at]panoramaonview[dot]org.“If what you are seeking is a truly magical venue, look no further than the Velaslavasay Panorama. My wife and I did not want to have the typical hotel conference hall wedding. We wanted to show our family from outside of LA a place that was meaningful to us and at the same time still impress our friends from LA. The Panorama is genuinely extraordinary, with several different areas that can be arranged to suit your celebration. Our guest list was about 70 people and it was the perfect size. We opted to have our main ceremony in the historic theatre, our cocktail reception with our bartender in the lush garden, our musician play in the gazebo, and our dinner in the large area outside the moon gate. This made it easy for pick ups and drop offs with our catering and table / chair / bar rental. Sara and Ruby from the Panorama were absolutely lovely to deal with and helped considerably with logistics before, during, and after the event. Our photographer loved all of the different backdrops possible and everyone kept mentioning how wonderful the venue was. Check it out, I'm sure you will be absolutely stunned by the Panorama.”Forest, 9 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/a692734c-8e10-4a93-b45a-415fa1b7370f?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/velaslavasay-panorama)

## About wedding venues in El Sobrante, CA

### 

California offers an incredible 840 miles of coastline, 3,000+ wineries and ancient redwoods for your wedding day. When you choose the Golden State, you're getting exceptional natural lighting for your ceremony across diverse settings from Mediterranean coastal zones to alpine mountain backdrops. Each region has its own distinctive character that can perfectly match your vision.

### What Makes California Wedding Venues So Special?

Northern California's Napa Valley welcomes you with rolling vineyards and Spanish colonial architecture where intimate wine cave ceremonies create unforgettable moments. Head to Southern California and you'll find oceanfront venues like Duke's Malibu where you can exchange vows with the Pacific stretching out behind you while enjoying fresh coastal-inspired cuisine. Palm Springs offers dramatic desert venues with mountain backdrops and striking midcentury modern architecture that photographs beautifully.

### How Much Do Wedding Venues in California Cost?

Wedding venues in California typically run between $9,600 and $11,700 which aligns nicely with the national range of $6,500-$12,000. This represents about 18% of your total wedding budget. Your overall costs will vary based on guest count:

  * 50 guests: $26,190
  * 100 guests: $43,692

  * 200 guests: $74,836

Accessibility options have improved greatly across California venues in recent years.

### When Should You Book Your California Wedding Venue?

October leads venue inquiries in California with couples typically booking venues about 13 months (400 days) before their wedding date. If you're dreaming of a Northern California wine country wedding during peak season you'll want to book up to 18 months in advance. Southern California venues offer more flexibility especially during winter months when you can still enjoy beautiful weather while potentially securing better rates.
