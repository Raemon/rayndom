Te Dua Weddings 5.0

  * Classic style
  * Starts at $1,200 
  * Serves Berkeley, CA
  * Offer

I started shooting photos and video in Greece, and since moving to the US, I have dedicated myself to shooting weddings, elopements and engagements. I love being able to capture the love that my couples have for each other and the unique energy each couple has. I am always down to shoot in new locations and find the best place for my shoots!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We were so lucky to have Te Dua Weddings capture our special day. From the moment we first spoke with Enea, his communication style was filled with love and enthusiasm and he understood exactly what we wanted/were looking for . Enea and Hayley were a true joy to work with, making us feel cared for and appreciated throughout the entire process. I came to Enea with the idea of entering our Venue with a video rather than with a song. Him and Hayley both captured our engagement pictures and clips for our video. He presented a beautiful gallery of photos for us and then the video. Which was perfect to say the least! The quality of their work is simply outstanding and you can tell they put their love into what they do! We are so grateful to have such beautiful, timeless photographs as well as Video that perfectly preserve the magic of our wedding and Engagement. Te Dua Weddings truly was one of a kind, going above and beyond to ensure our day was everything we dreamed of and more. We cannot recommend them highly enough. We ran into issues 4 days before with our Photographer (We only hired Te Dua for Wedding day Video) and Enea was kind enough to offer pictures as well in between capturing for the video. He did something he wasn't hired to do and made our day that much less stressful. Cheers Enea & Hayley. We are forever grateful for you two!! I will for sure be re-hiring them for any future events and I would chose them Over and over and over again. Don't hesitate to look elsewhere, Te Dua Weddings, is the perfect choice! Enea, YOU OUTDID YOURSELF!! P.S. I even got my Cinderella moment and it was unplanned!!!”Melissa C., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/d177fe3a-4eb6-404c-8ca3-cc8113c74ed3?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/enea-strora-photography-and-videography)

Hey Honey Photography 5.0

  * Classic style
  * Starts at $5,000 
  * Serves Berkeley, CA

Hi! I'm Anna the founder and senior photographer of Hey Honey Photography. I am a Texas-born, California girl at heart. I reside in the San Francisco Bay Area, and have a team of talented wedding photographers with a passion for capturing your life’s biggest moments and all your candid in betweens. Choosing a wedding photographer is more than just hiring someone with a camera to document your day. They should be someone who inspires you, helps ease wedding day jitters, and is your biggest fan, empowering you to be in the moment, while capturing what you want to remember forever, with creativity, boldness, and authenticity.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“From the moment we started planning our wedding, Anna and the team at Hey Honey Photography were an absolute joy to work with. She was an excellent communicator even through COVID and our wedding date shifting multiple times. We could not be happier with our wedding photos, we are absolutely obsessed! All of our images came out so beautiful, Anna captured the day even better than we imagined. She not only photographed every detail, she also surprised us with a very sweet card and a sneak peek of our photos with some beautiful polaroids she took that brought us to tears. We absolutely loved working with Anna, she was very professional, sweet, and her work is amazing. We also used her services for our engagement photos and they came out beautifully as well. We highly recommend Hey Honey Photography!”Cory R., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/66a31ca4-b0cb-4e2f-8408-8a9c5350efea?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/hey-honey-photography)

Hey, I'm Diep, the photographer at Warm Heart Photography. Based in Concord, California, I offer service around the Bay Area, and beyond. My goal is to sharpen my skills every day, serve my best, and create happy memories for my clients. Thank you for stopping by. I look forward to meeting you.“We are so happy we chose Warm Heart Photography (Diep) for both our engagement and wedding day photos. For our engagement shoot, she was incredibly friendly, responsive, and was very accommodating--even bringing a quick-change tent! She made sure to capture every shot we wanted from our shot list, and the photos turned out absolutely stunning and ethereal (exactly like we had envisioned). On our wedding day, Warm Heart Photography was equally amazing. Despite the hectic environment, Diep and her second shooter came prepared, was professional and adapted seamlessly to the ever changing environment. They worked hard to get every shot on our list, and the photos turned out beautiful and candid. (There were so many nice shots, that it was hard to choose our favorites!) They did such an amazing job with capturing everything on the day. We didn't have time to soak in everything around us, but with the photos, we were able to relive the day! Diep has a great work ethic and we wouldn't hesitate to refer her to our friends and family. We're so grateful for her talent, dedication, and kindness throughout the entire process. If you're looking for a photographer who truly cares about her clients and will do everything she can to capture your vision, Diep is the one!”Amy C., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/270a8ea8-066d-43ae-ab26-f5abab489cf3?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/warm-heart-photography)

At JB photography, we are storytellers and artists who believe in the power of love, connection, and creativity.

Photography is my passion that was passed down by my grandparents. They both loved to photograph our family, family events, and vacations. Unfortunately they both have passed away and are now in Heaven, but they have left us with their photographs of our past and everlasting memories of them that we cherish.“In a world where everything is digital around us, he uses real film! This helped make our photos for our wedding truly memorable. Since he uses film He would take his time and direct us perfectly to make every shot exactly how we wanted. He was friendly, and helped make us laugh without even trying. He had ideas for poses that we didn’t know or couldn’t even imagine! I expected to wait months for the film to be developed but it was developed quickly and he stayed in contact with us though out the process. It was a truly amazing experience all around and will use Oscar again in the future without a doubt!”Cadi & R., 5 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/oscar-campos-photography)

Hey Kelley! That mom with an artist's heart, that never makes enough time for herself but is still dying to try. I want to enjoy this life and all I am creating along that way. Photography is hardly the only thing I love in this world and I find none of us fit into one shape alone. Let's explore the different pieces and identities to celebrate YOUR story, not one you have seen somewhere else. Those loves, hobbies, and happenstance moments are all part of it. No need to be anything but you. I'm there to direct or just witness. We will know when we are in it. And hey I'm human, so I remember what it is like to have those jitters too...](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/lets-spread-beauty-photography-and-design)

I’m Tylar - a natural light photographer in the beautiful San Francisco Bay Area. I'm a native Californian with an old, Midwestern soul.

I'm very excitable, love to be outside the house doing things, and prefer to take on any DIY project over hiring a professional. In my spare time you can often find me either on the couch with a book or on my road bike in the county roads of Livermore.Why photography? I desire to showcase God's designs and use the creative skills that I've been given to bless others. When I have good pictures of myself with those that I love, I can look back and remember what we looked like and where we were, but also the emotions that we felt. The memories that come back with a good photo are irreplaceable, and I love being able to preserve them.](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/amber-rivas-photography)
