  * ### Alexa’s quinceañera 

•Verified review

•Fabiola M.•Jan 2, 2026

Hola, yo no soy de escribir reseñas pero en esta ocasión amerita hacerlo, si pudiera le diera 100 estrellas a Suisun Valley Inn. Desde el primer día que fuimos a conocer las instalaciones, el señor Gary fue muy atento y respetuoso, contestó a todas nuestras dudas. Tal vez nuestro evento fue algo fuera de lo común, a diferencia de los eventos de boda que se organizan aquí, nosotros contratamos el granero para el 25 de Diciembre para celebrar los 15 años de mi hija , sabemos que son días festivos donde la gente está con su familia , más sin embargo recibimos todo su apoyo para que el evento se hiciera realidad en este día tan especial , puedo decirles que fue una experiencia maravillosa, fue en evento de ensueño y de igual manera nos hospedamos en la casa, donde realmente nos sentimos como en nuestro hogar , sinceramente todas las instalaciones estuvieron limpias en todo momento, Gary estuvo al pendiente de si necesitábamos algo y al igual si la empresa que contratamos para la planeación necesitaban apoyo. Quiero animar a todos los papás que deseen hacerle su quinceañera a su hija, que consideren contratar los servicios de Suisun Valley Inn, ya que harán que su hija viva una experiencia única y de ensueño, no se arrepentirán. Sr Gary agradezco todas sus atenciones y muy pronto estaremos trabajando con usted para los 15 años de mi otra hija… Bendiciones

  * ### Great Venue

•Verified review

•Chris F.•Oct 24, 2025

My Wife and I recently hosted a wedding at the Suisun Valley Inn. Gary and his staff were incredibly helpful and ensured we had all needs fulfilled. The venue is incredibly beautiful and spacious. We also took advantage of using the Inn as "home base" and prep area for tons of wedding necessities, this proved to be immeasurably helpful. Convenient, clean and comfortable and reasonably priced, I highly recommend working with Gary and his facility....it helped make our Daughter's wedding memories unforgettable and Im sure you will find the same to be true for your family

  * ### The Perfect Spot!

•Verified review

•Irene D.•Jul 31, 2025

This was the perfect spot for our micro wedding/elopement! It's truly a special place..charming villa, beautiful grounds and landscape with plenty of spots for photo ops! The owner (Gary) was an absolute pleasure to communicate with. He was helpful, kind, and attentive. This was the ideal location for our smaller, more intimate wedding and I will forever treasure the wonderful memories we made at Suisun Valley Inn!

  * ### Picturesque Venue

•Verified review

•Jeff•Jun 20, 2025

We hosted our daughter’s wedding at Suisun Valley Inn, and it was truly amazing. Having the house for three days made the entire experience relaxed and enjoyable, giving us plenty of time to set up without feeling rushed. The venue is both stunning and incredibly versatile. We held the rehearsal dinner outdoors behind the house, the ceremony at the charming gazebo, and the reception in the newly built barn, which was spacious, elegant, and full of character. The three chandeliers cast a warm, graceful glow throughout the barn, transforming it into a ballroom worthy of a grand celebration. Gary was consistently professional, respectful, and highly responsive throughout the entire process. The setting created a wonderful weekend filled with unforgettable memories. If you're looking for an affordable, flexible, and picturesque venue, Suisun Valley Inn is an outstanding choice.
