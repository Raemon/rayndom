## About this venue

We are a non-profit, Member supported organization nestled in the suburbs of the East Bay. The Garden itself is the foremost example of garden design with climate-resilient plants. Consequently, it is known as one of the finest dry gardens in the world. The Garden displays an expansive collection of plants that Ruth collected for over 60 years; many of which were in gallon-sized pots or smaller. As a result, every season offers something new in the Garden and visitors find themselves in awe of the boldness, beauty and longevity of Ruth’s hard work! The Garden’s mission is to preserve, promote, and enhance Ruth Bancroft’s world-class collection of water-conserving plants displayed in her exceptionally designed garden for the education, inspiration, and enjoyment of the public.
