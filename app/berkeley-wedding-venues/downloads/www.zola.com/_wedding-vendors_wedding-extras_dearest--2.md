*Dearest is not a photo booth. Dearest is a beautifully simple way to gather and preserve memories from weddings, showers, birthdays, retirements, and more. Guests share photos, videos, and heartfelt messages via a personalized QR code—after the event, so they can be fully present. Every package includes a private gallery to view, download, print, or turn into a curated photobook. We also offer printable QR code templates, signage, and display cards on Etsy, with 100% of profits benefiting Vow for Girls, a global movement to end child marriage. More than a guest book, Dearest keeps the joy, love, and laughter alive long after the celebration.

QR Codes: photos, videos, and guest wishes! Dearest is designed for presence, not distraction. We skip the live feed so guests can enjoy the moment instead of checking their phones. Memories are collected afterward through a personalized QR code, creating a seamless, stress-free experience. Every package includes a private gallery and the option for a beautifully curated photo book. With event-matching QR templates and signage, plus 100% of Etsy profits supporting Vow for Girls, Dearest turns shared memories into a meaningful keepsake with a purpose. We are USA based, Female Founded & Available to all customers in the USA and Canada.

**In three words:** Calm, Practical, Supportive

  * ### Loved Preserving Memories!

•Verified review

•stacey k.•Nov 23, 2025

Me and my besties had a girls trip and we took SO MANY memorable photos. Instead of sending, sharing, remembering, etc., it was so easy for each of us to just post the photos to Dearest. Voila! Everything is compiled, organized and shared. We are all so happy to have this keepsake to remember such a fun trip/event. I recommend Dearest for anyone looking to gather photos/videos from multiple sources and to organize them. Hope to get the optional printed album next!

Response from vendor•Nov 24, 2025

Stacey- Thank you for your wonderful review! We are delighted to hear that you enjoyed your experience with Dearest! We love sharing in your joy and are honored to be a part of it!

  * ### Perfect Place to Capture and Share Sweet Memories!

•Verified review

•Nichole D.•Nov 23, 2025

I love how easy Dearest Events makes it to store, share, and print photos — the same photos that would have sat on my phone for years, never to be seen again. With Dearest Events, those moments don’t fade into the background. They have a special home where I can share them with friends and family, savor the memories, and feel more connected. It’s so much more than a place to keep photos — it’s a space to continue the laughs, the tears, the stories, and the moments that are near and dear to your heart.

Response from vendor•Nov 23, 2025

Thank you for the wonderful review Nichole! Savoring memories is what we are all about. We hope you enjoy your photos and photo gallery!

  * ### Love, love, love our unique guest book!

•Verified review

•Amy•Sep 9, 2025

We looked at so many different things to do for a guest book, but wanted something new and fresh. We found Dearest and loved the concept of not only capturing pictures, but also giving our guests the ability to add their well wishes too, and then that would turn into our actual printed guest book. The setup was so easy and we printed 4x6 cards with a QR code for the tables and bar area. My family even put some out at the rehearsal dinner and welcome party, so we had such a great variety of pictures that really told the story of our full wedding weekend. It was super easy for our guests, and then Dearest took everyone’s contributions and beautifully formatted everything. We loved the ability to share the link of our digital guest book with our families too. But our favorite part was reading everyone’s messages and seeing the pictures they chose. Highly recommend working with Dearest and hope to use them to celebrate and capture other milestone events in the future. Thank you Dearest! Ps- Would recommend maybe adding the QR code to your wedding website so people know where it is in case they forget to take a pic of it.

Response from vendor•Sep 10, 2025

Thank you for your wonderful review Amy! We are so glad Dearest met your expectations and you enjoyed using our platform! We look forward to being a part of your next celebration. Thank you for choosing Dearest!

•Verified review

•Isabella•Sep 6, 2025

Dearest provided exceptional experience for our event extras. Their communication style was professional, personalized, and efficient throughout the entire process. The team thoughtfully organized our memories into a high-quality, user-friendly app that made it easy for our wedding party to upload photos from our bachelor trip. We were so impressed by how quickly they delivered the final results, and the team was always available to answer any questions we had. We'll definitely be using Dearest for our wedding and highly recommend them to any couple looking for top-notch event extras!

Response from vendor•Sep 8, 2025

Thank you so much for the wonderful review Isabella! We are so thrilled you had a wonderful experience. We can't wait to be a part of your wedding! Thank you for choosing Dearest!
