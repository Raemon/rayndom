![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We are so happy we went with Chabot Space and Science Center for our wedding. We wanted something unique that also aligned with our interests -- our background in physics, astronomy, and space. The staff at Chabot are incredibly kind and were quick to respond to our emails and questions. The space was incredibly expansive and unique for our guests. The planetarium ceremony was our favorite part, and we will treasure those memories forever. As an educator myself, I fully appreciate that Chabot is a non-profit organization and that my deposit/rental fee goes back to the community and staff.

“We loved this venue and all our memories from our wedding. We worked with Narod who helped in all communication. We also got help from Ryan in AV. They were both so easy going and great to work with! We loved how beautiful the setup is. The ceremony outside was so nice. The Redwood Hall is also so gorgeous for photos and fun for dancing. We also really liked the cocktail area. We got an animal ambassador and guests had fun seeing the ferret and kestrel. We got nothing but compliments related to how fun the venue was. We are so happy we chose this place for our wedding. We loved the experience. Thank you to CuriOdyssey for going above and beyond. From communication early on to day of. It was amazing!”Natalie M., 4 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/curiodyssey)

“Bride’s Perspective Our wedding was a candlelit pizza party in the garden—casual, approachable, and elegant all at once. About 80 guests came. The ceremony was under the tree near the entrance. During cocktail hour, some guests (especially families with kids) enjoyed docent-led tours of the house. For dinner, we seated everyone at two long banquet tables on the bricks. While a lot of us were dancing inside, guests also gathered outside around the heaters under blankets we provided. The venue’s gardens and old trees meant we needed very little décor — we went with some DIY Trader Joe’s flowers & lots of candles. When the sun set, the glow from the candles and string lights provided by LAHM was magical. One highlight was cutting the cake at the end of the tables, looking out at our laughing, candlelit guests. We expected warm October weather, but the forecast dipped into the low 60s. Propane heaters worked perfectly, and combined with candles, lights, and blankets, the night felt intimate and warm. We live close to the venue and got ready at home, which turned out to be ideal—relaxed, convenient, and comfortable. Before planning, I imagined a rustic barn wedding, while my husband wanted something elegant. The museum was the perfect balance — and better than either of us pictured. Working with Lisa was wonderful. She was professional, responsive, and calm from the first walkthrough through the end of the night. I enjoyed checking in with her throughout the event, and everything ran smoothly. We trusted her recommendations and appreciated how she coordinated with all our vendors. We joke that if we ever got married again, we’d do it all the same — same space, same people, same Lisa! Groom’s Perspective We knew our venue search was over when we found the Los Altos History Museum. Lisa, the venue coordinator, not only manages a beautiful space but also brings clarity with straightforward policies and transparent pricing, which gave us freedom to design the day exactly how we wanted. The event moved naturally through the property: ceremony under the trees, cocktails near the house, dinner on the bricks, and dancing inside. It felt private but accessible, and the gardens were perfect for photos. My favorite moment was watching the sun set over dinner as candles and string lights took over. Lisa was fantastic — responsive, flexible, and organized. She met with our vendors in advance and made space to store supplies several days ahead of the wedding. She was the first to arrive and last to leave. She even helped pack our car at the end of the night. A few notes for future couples: there’s limited getting-ready space (we used our home, which worked great), tenting for rain can be tricky and expensive, and there’s no commercial kitchen. None were issues for us, and Lisa explained these points to us early so there were no surprises.

“As a vendor, we love working at Club Auto Sport. Its unique theme and combination of indoor space and large outdoor patio make it easy to create different vignettes, especially when there is a cocktail hour that needs its own space. The venue is home to a collection of classic exotic cars and tons of racing memorabilia, lovingly displayed. The owners take such good care of the venue, and strive to provide a great experience from start to finish. Club Auto Sport is truly a great partner!”Tony Caters, 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/club-auto-sport)

“We hosted our October 2023 Wedding Reception at The Tech Interactive and I highly recommend it to anybody who is looking for a unique (and literally interactive) venue. It was so much fun and our guests had a great time! We rented the entire lower level and they kept the galleries and exhibits open so our guests could play with them throughout the night! They were a hit during cocktail hour as well as for taking breaks from the dance floor (although we still always had plenty of people on the dance floor!) Our event was mostly adults with a handful of younger relatives, and everyone had a great time. The exhibits at The Tech Interactive are perfect for quick and fun interactions no matter how interested (or not interested) any individual guest was in science/technology. Our engineer friends had a great time with the Cyber Detectives activities, while even our least technically-inclined guests enjoyed playing around with things like the Jet Pack Chair and Solve For Earth. This was truly best of both worlds, as we didn't have to give up any of the "traditional" wedding elements to make room for the fun of the exhibits - our tables and decorations were set up beautifully, we still had appetizers and an open bar, and like I mentioned above, there were still always plenty of people on the dance floor! We actually didn't even need to decorate as much as we might have with a more "traditional" venue either, as the existing colors, lighting, and layout of The Tech make for a strong baseline to build from. Our primary contact was Lolita and she was extremely helpful and pleasant to work with. She was there with us every step of the way, from our initial tour to our reception itself. She made sure to consider exactly what we were looking for to make our wedding special and was extremely organized and great and communicating with us as well as our other vendors. She created a great layout based on our table count, dance floor size, and the space the caterer needed, and she and her team went above and beyond and worked with our caterer and coordinator to help set everything up between the public close time and the start of our event so that everything was perfect when our guests got there. They even let us customize the exterior lighting color of the building during our event. The physical location of The Tech Interactive is fantastic as well - right in downtown San Jose within walking distance of tons of hotels and two parking garages where The Tech validates. The city closed off Market Street right in front of The Tech relatively last minute for a public city event, but Lolita was on top of it and worked with us and our shuttle company to arrange for pickup and a smooth experience for our guests. In summary: If you're looking to do something unique with your wedding or event, I can't recommend The Tech Interactive enough. Lolita was fantastic to work with and our guests couldn't stop saying how it was one of the most fun weddings they had ever been to.”Steve W., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-tech-interactive)

## About wedding venues in Lafayette, CA

### 

California offers an incredible 840 miles of coastline, 3,000+ wineries and ancient redwoods for your wedding day. When you choose the Golden State, you're getting exceptional natural lighting for your ceremony across diverse settings from Mediterranean coastal zones to alpine mountain backdrops. Each region has its own distinctive character that can perfectly match your vision.

### What Makes California Wedding Venues So Special?

Northern California's Napa Valley welcomes you with rolling vineyards and Spanish colonial architecture where intimate wine cave ceremonies create unforgettable moments. Head to Southern California and you'll find oceanfront venues like Duke's Malibu where you can exchange vows with the Pacific stretching out behind you while enjoying fresh coastal-inspired cuisine. Palm Springs offers dramatic desert venues with mountain backdrops and striking midcentury modern architecture that photographs beautifully.

### How Much Do Wedding Venues in California Cost?

Wedding venues in California typically run between $9,600 and $11,700 which aligns nicely with the national range of $6,500-$12,000. This represents about 18% of your total wedding budget. Your overall costs will vary based on guest count:

  * 50 guests: $26,190
  * 100 guests: $43,692
  * 150 guests: $60,141
  * 200 guests: $74,836
  * 250 guests: $89,530

Accessibility options have improved greatly across California venues in recent years.

### When Should You Book Your California Wedding Venue?

October leads venue inquiries in California with couples typically booking venues about 13 months (400 days) before their wedding date. If you're dreaming of a Northern California wine country wedding during peak season you'll want to book up to 18 months in advance. Southern California venues offer more flexibility especially during winter months when you can still enjoy beautiful weather while potentially securing better rates.
