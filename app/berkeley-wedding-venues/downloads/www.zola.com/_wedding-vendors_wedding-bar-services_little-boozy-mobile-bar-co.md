Keirsten and Chris are so talented and friendly. Our guests raved about the drinks and small talk with the bartenders! They ensured our event went smoothly from start to finish. Beyond that, they made the drinks memorable by tailoring them to us and adding fun garnishes!

  * ### The best bartenders! 

•Verified review

•Kristin•Dec 17, 2024

The services provided by Little Boozy Mobile Bar Co. were exceptional. Their communication throughout the planning process was quick, effective, and highly descriptive, putting our minds at ease. The quality of their work and the value they provided were truly amazing. They created individualized, detailed drink menus that catered perfectly to our wedding party and guests. From the incredible cocktails to the delicious mocktails, they brought all the required ingredients and equipment to make our drinks yummy and memorable. We wouldn't have gone with any other bartenders - they were great to have as part of our special day and we highly recommend them to anyone looking for top-notch bar services for their wedding or event.

We absolutely love working with the Little Boozy Mobile Bar team! They’re an absolute dream to collaborate with—easy to communicate with, detail-oriented, and always bringing their incredible personalities and top-notch customer service to every event. Their selection of mobile bars and the charming ice cream cart add such a unique and stylish touch, and you can tell they take immense pride in their craft. From start to finish, they ensure every guest feels like a VIP, creating an unforgettable experience. We’re so lucky to have Little Boozy on our preferred vendor list at Rough & Ready Vineyards, and we can’t wait for all the amazing events we’ll create together in the future!

We had such an awesome experience using Little Bozy mobile bar for an event that we recently hosted. They created signature cocktails especially for our party along with our other recommended beverages. Their communication and professionalism they provided was perfect. Looking forward to working with them again for our next event. Thank you Chris & Keirsten for everything!
