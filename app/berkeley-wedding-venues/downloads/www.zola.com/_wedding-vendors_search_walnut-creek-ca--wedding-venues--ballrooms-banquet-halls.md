![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“San Ramon Waters By Wedgewood Weddings was a stunning venue for our wedding, but we did experience some minor communication issues that caused a bit of stress at the start of the day. The space itself was truly breathtaking, with its amazing new upgrades and beautiful views. However, there were a few details that weren't properly communicated to us, which led to a bit of a rocky start. Although my bridal party and I had lots to deal with prior to ceremony start, these issues were not something our guests would have seen/noticed. To their credit, the Wedgewood team acknowledged their mistakes and upgraded our bar package to make up for it. Overall, the venue was beautiful and the staff did their best to ensure our day went smoothly, despite the initial hiccups. We would recommend San Ramon Waters to other couples looking for a gorgeous wedding location.”Gabriella G., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/09e08c08-a991-4f46-8f27-5f0c08b2944c?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/san-ramon-by-wedgewood-weddings)

“The Clubhouse at Boundary Oak was an absolute dream venue for our wedding! From the moment we walked through the doors, Angelique and her team made us feel welcomed and valued. Their communication was quick and responsive, always making sure we had the information we needed. The venue itself was clean, welcoming, and simply beautiful - the perfect backdrop for our special day. On the day of the wedding, Angelique went above and beyond, checking in on me and ensuring my guests felt right at home. She coordinated seamlessly with our vendors, leaving me stress-free to simply enjoy the moment. I can't thank the Clubhouse team enough for making our wedding day a dream come true.

## About wedding venues in Walnut Creek, CA

### 

Walnut Creek offers an exceptional wedding destination that blends Mediterranean-inspired gardens with historic architecture, all set against Mount Diablo's stunning backdrop.
