  * ### Very pleased

•Verified review

•Armando and L.•May 7, 2025

My wife, Laura, and I were very pleased with Emilio Garcia officiating our wedding. He had a calming, natural ability that helped our guests feel welcomed and part of a truly joyous occasion. We had met with him prior to the ceremony and said a little humor would be good and he provided it with charm. Two thumbs up!

  * ### Wedding Coordinator 

•Verified review

•Wendy•May 1, 2025

As a wedding coordinator, I’ve worked with many officiants, but Emilio truly stands out. From our very first interaction, he was responsive, thoughtful, and incredibly professional. He communicated clearly and consistently, which made my job so much easier. Emilio has an excellent speaking voice and a calm, confident presence that immediately put everyone at ease—couple and guests alike. He arrived on time, fully prepared, and delivered a beautiful, heartfelt ceremony that was perfectly tailored to the couple. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend him to anyone looking for a warm, reliable, and polished officiant. Thank you, Emilio!
