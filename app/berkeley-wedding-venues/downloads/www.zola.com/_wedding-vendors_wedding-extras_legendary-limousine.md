We booked a Stretch Limousine from Legendary Limousine for our wedding day, and the experience was absolutely flawless from start to finish! Our pickup was from the St. Regis Hotel in Manhattan, and we were dropped off at the stunning Brooklyn Botanic Garden for our ceremony. From the moment our chauffeur arrived, everything was professional, punctual, and stress-free. The limo was immaculate, beautifully decorated, and spacious enough to comfortably fit our bridal party. The driver was courteous, knowledgeable about NYC traffic, and made the ride smooth and enjoyable. What really stood out was how Legendary Limousine went above and beyond to make our wedding day extra special. They handled every detail with precision, which allowed us to relax and fully enjoy our day. Whether you’re planning a wedding, anniversary, or special celebration, I highly recommend Legendary Limousine. Their luxury vehicles, including Stretch Limousines, SUVs, and Sprinter Vans, are perfect for making any event memorable. If you want a reliable, professional, and luxurious ride in Manhattan, Brooklyn, or Queens, this is the company to choose!

Absolutely. We welcome couples to schedule a viewing so you can see the exact vehicle reserved for your wedding. This helps you visualize your transportation experience and ensures complete confidence in your choice.

### How much is the deposit to secure our date?

A small deposit—typically $100–$250, depending on the vehicle and service package—is required to reserve your date. The deposit is applied to your total balance, and the remaining amount is due one week before the wedding.

### What types of vehicles are available in your wedding fleet?

Legendary Limousine offers a luxury fleet including classic sedans, SUVs, stretch limousines (6–10 passengers), and even a 24–36 passenger party bus. We tailor vehicle selection to your guest count, photo schedule, and style of celebration.

Yes. We provide several customizable wedding packages: Classic Wedding Transportation (sedan/SUV for ~3 hours) Premium Stretch Limo Experience (limousine, photo stops, LED lighting, 4 hours) Luxury Wedding Party Bus (roomy, fun, sound system + mini‑bar, 5 hours)

### Are the chauffeurs experienced with weddings?

Definitely. Our chauffeurs are professionally trained, experienced in wedding logistics, and committed to punctuality, discretion, and flexibility. We prioritize a calm, supportive presence so your transportation feels luxurious yet stress‑free

### How do you handle timeline coordination on the wedding day?

We include complimentary timeline coordination in our packages. Before your big day, we’ll review your schedule, map out pick-up times, photo stop locations, and transitions to make sure transportation aligns perfectly with your ceremony, portraits, and reception.

### What if our plans change or we need to add stops last minute?

We understand weddings often evolve, and we build in flexibility. Our team can adapt to changes in real time — whether you want to add a photo stop, change drop-off order, or adjust timing. Our goal is to support your vision while maintaining reliability and elegance on the day.
