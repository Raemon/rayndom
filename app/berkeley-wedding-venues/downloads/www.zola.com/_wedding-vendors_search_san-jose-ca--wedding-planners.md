Kaci Danae Events 5.0 San Jose, CA

  * Offers 3 services
  * Starts at $500 

I’ve always been inspired by the strong, ambitious women in my life who built successful small businesses in the hospitality industry — from restaurant owners and bakers to caterers and florists. Growing up surrounded by their entrepreneurial spirit, I was motivated to follow my own path and create something meaningful in the world of events. ​ After spending two years working as a Wedding Coordinator at the Westin, the pandemic hit and forced a pause on hotel weddings. That unexpected turn of events only fueled my determination to turn my passion into a full-time business. And so, Kaci Danae Events was born.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Kaci was the perfect day-of-coordinator and we highly, highly recommend her. She shepherded us through the month- and day-of calmly and confidently and made the wedding day run smoothly. About a month before, we met with her to discuss our priorities for our wedding, establish a timeline, and make sure we were on top of all the details. She came to this meeting very organized, and prompted us to think about things that weren't even on our radar - as an example, whether we wanted a grand entrance and what song we'd like for that. As we got closer to the wedding day, she took over communicating with our vendors and provided all of them with detailed itineraries and instructions. A few of our vendors told us that Kaci was one of the more organized coordinators they've worked with. She was very responsive if we had questions or wanted clarifications and was always open to more communication. On the day of, she was perfect - we felt totally at ease knowing that all of the vendors knew the plan and that Kaci would tell us where to be and when. She had a calming tone and checked in regularly to make sure we had everything we needed, and was instantly responsive if we needed anything or wanted to make last-minute changes. We were able to focus entirely on enjoying the party. We are so glad we chose Kaci!!”Matthew S., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/kaci-danae-events)

I take the time to really get to know my couple (and their families!) prior to the wedding so that you can be assured I completely understand your vision and can execute it as if you were doing it yourself. This allows you to relax the night before and truly enjoy the entire wedding day.“Hiring Ashley was easily one of the best decisions we made for our DIY wedding. Here’s why: 1\. Ashley does it all. When you’re planning your own wedding, the last thing you want is to juggle a dozen vendors. The fact that Ashley is a day-of coordinator, florist, and dessert person is a huge plus. We even asked her to cater our farewell brunch the next day! 2\. Flowers: They were freaking beautiful. We asked for bud vases and my bridal bouquet, and I’m not exaggerating when I say I teared up when I saw my bouquet. 3\. Dessert: We told Ashley that our guests weren’t really dessert people, yet the fact that there was almost no dessert left is a testament to how tasty everything was. The heart cake she made for us to cut into was adorable and, unsurprisingly, delicious. 4\. Day-of coordination: Where do I even begin? Ashley was easily the most responsive vendor we worked with, but more importantly, she has a way of putting you completely at ease—which means so much when you’re a DIY bride juggling a million things. Here’s the best example I have: just over a week before the wedding, I realized I had given Ashley the WRONG DATE for the wedding. I had somehow missed it in all our communications and contracts. It was 100% my fault, and when I realized it, I was this close to throwing up all over myself. We were one week out, and I was screaming. I immediately texted Ashley to apologize and ask if she was still free, and instead of freaking out, she simply said, “Don’t worry, I’ll figure it out. You’ll have a beautiful day—don’t worry!” And she did. She dealt with her hotel, juggled all the logistics for the flowers, and made it work. That’s exactly the same calm, helpful energy she brought on the wedding day. When I realized there was no wine on the tables during our reception, she handled it. When I asked her to come early for a rehearsal, she did. There were a million little details that I either a) thought I had accounted for (as someone who is extremely Type A and naturally anxious) or b) hadn’t even thought of (since I’d never planned a wedding before), and Ashley either handled them herself or discreetly gave me two potential solutions to choose from. One example: vendor meals. Obviously, you know you have to feed your vendors, but I hadn’t considered where they were going to eat—it was still on my to-do list the morning of the wedding. With a million things happening, I didn’t get to it, but thanks to Ashley, all our vendors were fed and I didn’t have to worry about it one bit. 5\. Bonus perk: Ashley has a bunch of wedding items you can borrow (like candle holders, easels, signage), which is a game-changer when you want to be mindful of the planet and avoid buying, dumping, or reselling everything afterward. All this being said—if you’re a DIY bride and think you can just deal with all these little details yourself (or have your maid of honor or mom do it), don’t. Hire Ashley instead. No matter how organized or prepared you are (which I thought I was!), you need to hand over the reins—and Ashley is the perfect person to pick up where you leave off. The amount of stress and anxiety she took off my shoulders on our wedding day (and before that!) was worth every single penny. I cannot thank her enough.”Gisella, 3 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/45223a6e-dcf9-4961-bf8d-b33e5af4c0d8?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/the-busy-moms-kitchen-events)

We never felt behind schedule or rushed because Yoko and team were so organized and on top of it. They really took care of us throughout the entire process.

Welcome and congratulations on your engagement!

As a former Executive Assistant it was easy to transition to becoming a Wedding Coordinator. I traded managing CEOs and their schedules for managing couples and theirs!

I never experienced any anxiety and knew that she had absolutely everything under control. My husband and I arrived before anyone else and watched as she seamlessly made sure that everything was done as planned. Her presence was barely noticeable except when needed and then she would almost magically appear anticipating the need. I am so impressed with her skills and I would wholeheartedly recommend her to my closest friends and family.”Yvette S., 2 years ago![](https://images.zola.com/7d953d28-a653-4a4a-868f-6f70b65075f9?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/patricia-torres-events)

Hi! I’m Yi — your certified wedding BFF and the heart of Yiventful Co. It all began with my sister-in-law’s wedding, and I’ve been hooked ever since. We believe every celebration should feel effortless, joyful, and personal. From intimate gatherings to big parties, we handle the details so you can be fully present. Let’s create something that reflects your love — and leave the stress to us!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“As a fellow wedding vendor, I thought I'd seen it all when it came to wedding planning. Having meticulously planned nearly every detail of my own wedding for almost two years, I considered myself quite organized. However, bringing Yi on board as our month-of coordinator was undoubtedly the best decision we made for our wedding day. I initially connected with Yi through a previous wedding where we both worked, and her professionalism and calm demeanor immediately instilled a deep sense of trust. Knowing her work ethic firsthand, I had high expectations, but Yi didn't just meet them- she delivered far beyond anything we could have imagined! Yi possesses an amazing ability to anticipate needs and catch every single detail, no matter how small. Even with my extensive planning, she consistently reminded us of crucial elements we might have overlooked, ensuring nothing fell through the cracks. She meticulously managed every aspect of the day and even corrected a few design choices that were originally done erroneously by the venue, ensuring our vision was perfectly executed. On the wedding day, while there were inevitably a few small hiccups, Yi handled each one with such seamless efficiency that my husband and I were completely shielded from any stress. She truly went above and beyond, allowing us to fully immerse ourselves in the joy of our celebration, without a single worry. Her presence was super calming, making what could have been chaotic day into the best day. We felt so supported and taken care of by her throughout the entire process. Beyond her incredible organizational skills, Yi's communication was always very responsive, clear, and reassuring. She is truly such a joy to work with. She even stayed late after the festivities to ensure all our personal items were packed up safely, demonstrating her unwavering commitment to her clients.

ASE Studio is a boutique event planning and styling studio specializing in event planning, spatial design, and event coordination based in San Francisco. We plan events across California and beyond. We love to dream boundlessly with each of our clients, chasing the poetry of place, the journey of process, and the beauty of details, always with a spirit of adventure.“I truly believe that without ASE Studio, our wedding would not have been possible, or at least, it would not have become the beautiful, romantic-filled memory that makes both us and our guests smile whenever we think of it. What I love most about ASE Studio is their incredible sense of beauty. It goes beyond training or experience; it comes from the passion for bringing imagination to life and creating beauty. From the very beginning, we dreamed of a wedding that felt like an exhibition, one that could tell our story. When it comes to life, I tend to follow my feelings rather than a plan, while my husband approaches it with his own orderly system. That balance gave birth to the theme of our wedding—“The Daydream Library.” Starting from this idea, Hannah and Stella began to shape it into reality, laying a foundation as poetic and delicate as clouds and veil, they are truly the architects of atmosphere! Through these concepts, they carefully curated and wove together vendors into a framework of beauty, while thoughtfully connecting every detail to reflect our personalities—so that each little moment spoke softly of who we are. Much like many other things in life, planning a wedding from the ground up was a true test of patience, attention to detail, and willpower. But only with love and creativity in every step (as Hannah and Stella showed), can be called true adventurers. We are so grateful to have shared this journey with ASE Studio. I will not be surprised at all when they go on to create even more extraordinary wonders.”Ricco, 4 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/ase-studio)

Weddings with Athena 5.0

  * Offers 6 services

  * Serves San Jose, CA

Hi, I’m Athena! As a wedding planner and event coordinator based in Northern CA, I specialize in creating seamless and memorable celebrations. With years of experience in the industry and a background in design consulting, I focus on bringing my clients’ unique visions to life while ensuring a stress-free planning experience. Whether you're dreaming of an intimate gathering or a grand affair, I’m here to guide you every step of the way—from vendor coordination to timeline creation and all the little details in between. My goal is to make the planning process enjoyable and to craft an event that truly reflects you.“We absolutely adored Athena and she made our wedding day memorable and fun! Athena was very organized and proactive about keeping us on track. She was also creative and came with great tips during the planning process to help us adhere to our budget. She went above and beyond helping us decorate our venue at Elliston Vineyards and coordinating everyone and everything. I wish we had her help to plan our evening reception at another venue during the time because we had such a great time with her! One of our best memories is sitting in the back of a golf cart as Athena took us from the post-ceremony photoshoot to the cocktail hour and reminding us to stay present and we did it! We highly recommend Athena for your wedding planning!”Emily & S., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/72ef828a-6da6-4971-ae34-6108db122958?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/weddings-with-athena)

From the moment we started our wedding planning journey, Evelyn's kindness, guidance and unwavering support made every step a happy experience. Planning has never been my forte and I overwhelm easily when decisions need to be made, but her gentle guidance throughout the months of planning alleviated any stress I had, and her attention to detail ensured that every corner of our special day was nothing short of perfect. From coordinating vendors to orchestrating the flow of events seamlessly, they allowed us to fully enjoy ourselves in the moment without a worry in the world. Our guests were also so happy saying on multiple occasions it was the best wedding they had ever been to. One of the extra cherished highlights of our day was the ceremony where Evelyn also took the role as our officiant. Her heartfelt words and genuine warmth created an atmosphere that exceeded our wildest dreams and had everyone crying. We also had live music for ceremony and cocktail hour provided by Aspen Strings which really added that elegant touch we had always envisioned. In short, Love & Laughter Weddings not only met but surpassed every expectation we had for our wedding day.

Hello nearlyweds! I'm Margarita, yes just like the tasty tropical drink. :) I love weddings and I always have. I have cried at all the ones I have attended, and my friends tease me because I will ask anyone who has me over to show me their wedding album! I have spent the past few years working for Wedgewood Weddings and learning everything there is to know about weddings and events. I have helped plan over 200 weddings and personally coordinated more than 120 weddings with guest counts ranging from 20-250+. Prior to that I worked in tech account management, which gave me the experience to provide you with top tier customer service.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We used a Website called Mostest to find a budget friendly day of coordinator. We were initially skeptical of Mostest and how it worked, because we only meet the planner one month before the day of the event. This was only because we used a day of coordinator, rather than a full on event planner. Our wedding was 120 people at Cavallo Point Lodge. Ceremony was outside, cocktail hour was under a nice heated tent, and the dinner & Dancing was inside in a banquet hall. One Month before the wedding, We have our first call with Margarita. She was exceptional in every way. She had a template of the items that she knew we needed to think through. She then seamlessly and meticulously took the agenda from the photographer, venue, florist, caterer, DJ, and any other vendors that I'm for getting and put them into a PERFECT PDF that they each used for the coordination of the day. In total, we met with Margarita a total of three or four times before the wedding. Despite our initial skepticism with Mostest, by the day of our wedding we had absolutely question in our mind about how smoothly the day would go - and this was BECAUSE of margarita. After each meeting, she would give us a "To do" list of things we needed to decide on. At each subsequent meeting, she would circle back and cross every single T and dot every single I. We had a pretty "Involved" Wedding - a Long walk in to the ceremony from the bridal suite, father of the bride doing the ceremony, two readings by family members, A song played & sung by the sister of the bride (with an acoustic electric guitar which required an amp and a microphone setup for singing), a tree planting ceremony, personally written vows, and coordinated music throughout. Margarita had each of these things timed down to the minute (second?). If we allocated too much or too little time for one thing, she would tell us and we'd adjust accordingly. She was early to our wedding rehearsal, ready to roll in the cold Sausalito wind, and was there early on the day of our wedding to make sure that things went smoothly. By the end of the wedding, our mantra was "Just ask Margarita and do whatever she says". Because sincerely as two people who have never been married and frankly had no clue what is involved in orchestrating a wedding - Margarita absolutely cannot be beat. Even after the wedding, she somehow perfectly boxed up all of our stuff so that we could come and grab it the next day. Thank you Margarita for making this day so incredibly special for Taylor and I. We're now looking to host more events JUST so we can work with Margarita again.”John and T., a month ago![](https://images.zola.com/7768f81b-1e34-40ca-92af-8531a06a75b1?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-planners/events-by-margarita)
