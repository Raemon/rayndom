My husband and I worked with Pastor Lawrence for a year of faith-based pre-marital counseling and had an amazing experience. We, like many couples, went into our first session thinking we’d already discussed the most important topics and we’d maybe need to do 3 formal pre-marital counseling sessions. Our first session was so impactful that we immediately decided that we wanted a full year of counseling. That decision, we believe, completely changed the trajectory of our marriage. Pastor Lawrence asked difficult, thought-provoking questions that helped us see our relationship (with each other and with God) in new ways, and each session left us feeling better equipped for marriage than we ever expected. His depth of knowledge, approachability, and ability to guide meaningful, relevant conversations aimed at aligning us as one—even when we thought we had nothing new to discuss—was truly a gift. We are so grateful for the wisdom and encouragement he poured into us throughout this process and would highly recommend him to any couple who is looking to build a strong, Christ-centered foundation going into their marriage.
