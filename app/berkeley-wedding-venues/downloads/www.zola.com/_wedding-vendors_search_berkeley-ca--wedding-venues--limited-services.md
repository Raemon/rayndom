“We had the absolute best experience hosting our wedding here. Natasha Norman was incredible to work with through the entire planning process. She was clear on pricing, set our expectations well, was incredibly responsive, and helped coordinate the event on the day of the wedding. We asked for some extra time to set up the room and, since the room hadn't been booked the day before the event, she let us come in the day prior to get everything in order. Natasha spoke with our DJ and coordinated for his set-up, which was very helpful. The team setting up the event also did the perfect job of setting up the tables and outdoor chairs exactly as we'd asked. I changed my mind on the arch at the last minute, and they had no problem making the change. The wedding was incredible, our guests felt comfortable in their rooms and were pleased they could bring their dogs so they didn't have to hire a dog-sitter. Everyone was impressed by the view and by the fact that the sun was setting behind the sweetheart table in the Bayview Ballroom. I also want to give a shoutout to the banquet manager who made us feel at home, kindly brought us beverages as we were setting up, and took care of us throughout the stay. I’ve received at least half a dozen compliments on the qualify of the food served, and I felt the pricing was very reasonable – especially when compared to other hotels on the water nearby. I also loved that the hotel provided us a contingency plan if we needed to move our outdoor wedding to the indoors because of rain or anything else. We truly felt special and valued and would use this venue again in a heartbeat.”Lindsey M., 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-doubletree-by-hilton-berkeley-marina)
