  * ### Northend photography is the best!!

•Verified review

•Cam + G.•Aug 26, 2022

We met Alyssa through her instagram contest and have been so close ever since! She has documented such important parts of our lives in such a short time. Our engagement photos came out better than I envisioned and our elopement was magical! For our elopement, we did her elopement packaged she offered, and everyone she worked with made our day even more special. Alyssa has always answered any and all questions concerns in a timely and professional matter. Hire Northend Photography, they capture moments you didn’t even know existed and you won’t regret meeting them!

  * ### Best Wedding Photographer!!!

•Verified review

•Noam and D.•Aug 24, 2022

We absolutely LOVED having Alyssa and her husband be our wedding photographers! From the moment we met her at our engagement shoot we new we had made the right choice. Even though I truly hate being the center of attention and getting my pictures taken, Alyssa made us feel so comfortable so that we could enjoy the day and be in the moment. Leading up to the wedding, she was super responsive to all my questions and when the big day came along everything went so smoothly. Alyssa even fixed my makeup when I cried it all off after the ceremony!! We love our pictures so much. They capture the day perfectly and I don’t think anyone could have given me the simple outdoorsy/elegant summer camp vibe that I wanted except for her. I couldn’t recommend Alyssa and her husband enough!!

## Frequently asked questions

9 Answers

Ask them a question

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically, couples book me about 13 months before their wedding date. I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible about my availability, even if you’re planning on a shorter time frame.

### Do you work with assistants or other photographers?

Depending on the package, I always shoot with my husband if for some reason he's not available I use one of my trusted colleagues.

### Will you edit all our pictures?

Definitely. All final images will be edited for color, saturation, exposure, and sharpness to ensure they look beautiful. I also offer retouching services like blemish removal and teeth whitening for an additional charge.

### Do you also offer video services?

We do, we offer photography + videography packages with our trusted colleague @houseofhopefilms

### How many pictures will we get?

You can expect about 80 to 100 images per hour of photographing. But keep in mind this estimate varies depending on your wedding package, number of guests, venue type, and other factors.

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

My turnaround time varies by season. Typically, you’ll be able to view your photos online about 4-6 weeks after your wedding. However I do sent sneaks 24-48 hours after your wedding.

### Do you have insurance?

I do! Just let me know if your venue requires a certificate of liability, and I’ll send that over to them.

### What’s your back-up plan if you can’t photograph our wedding as planned?

In my 5 years of experience as a wedding photographer, I’ve never cancelled a booking. In the very rare event that I’m unable to photograph your wedding, I’ll make sure you’re covered by one of my colleagues or my contracted assistant. I’ll also provide you with a list of photographers from the many networking groups I’m in, so you can find the perfect replacement.

### Do you offer payment plans?

We do! We understand wedding photography is a huge investment but one that's important. We offer customized plans that fit your needs. Just ask us!
