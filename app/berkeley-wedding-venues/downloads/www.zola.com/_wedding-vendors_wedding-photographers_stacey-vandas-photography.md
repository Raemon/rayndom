I'm a film & digital photographer based in the Midwest but traveling internationally to capture heartfelt moments and authentic love stories with a cinematic and nostalgic feel. I started out with travel photography but my passion for portraiture and timeless romance led me to specialize in creative, artful weddings, destination weddings, and intimate couples shoots for intentional couples who want something beyond the traditional, cookie cutter photo vibe.

I take a quality over quantity approach, making sure I capture the moments that matter most in artistic way. My favorite moments are the ones that are raw, unedited, completely showing your love and your personalities, and I strive to capture those fleeting moments. I prioritize authenticity warmth, and emotion over stale poses, and I love to get creative with motion in my work. The end result is a collection of photos that bottle a feeling and a moment in time, with an extra dose of artful flair and filmy nostalgia. My goal is for you to look back on every single photo with cheeks that hurt from smiling as you remember the moment!

  * ### Hire Stacey! Do it!

•Verified review

•Sabrina•Jan 1, 2026

If you are considering using Stacey as your wedding photographer, DO IT! We had a very DIY wedding and only hired a vendor for photography and for the actual venue, I could not be happier with our choice to hire Stacey. She is the perfect mix of professional, friendly, and kind. From our initial interview, to our brainstorming session, to the day of the wedding, Stacey lead us through what we could expect while giving us the space to be creative. After looking through the sneak peak, I can confirm that Stacey captured us as ourselves, goofy and loving and real. Hiring Stacey is easily one of the best decisions we made in the wedding planning process! Do it!

•Verified review

•Diana C.•Jul 10, 2025

From the moment we booked Stacey, we knew we were in good hands! She’s incredibly thorough, forward-thinking, and detailed in her pre-wedding communication, ensuring we were all on the same page — she thought about a ton of details we would’ve forgotten (& I’m pretty type A!). On the day of our wedding, Stacey and her day-of assistant were kind, calming presences, allowing us to be fully present with our guests while still capturing the perfect photos to remember our special day. The quality of her work is amazing - we’ve recieved sneak peaks from our wedding two weeks ago (which were a TON more than a lot of my friends have gotten from other photographers!) and we’re in awe of the beautiful, artistic shots she delivered… Stacey's talent is honestly worth far more than she charges. She made my husband and I feel so natural and comfortable and cool! We're so grateful to have found Stacey all the way in Missouri for our CT wedding and would recommend her to any couple looking for elevated, fun, and whimsical wedding photography!

  * ### The perfect film and photography style!

•Verified review

•Yvonne•Apr 3, 2025

Stacey was a dream to work with! She was quick to respond from the minute we submitted an inquiry to weeks after our elopement. She also scheduled an initial zoom meeting before even signing anything which was very personable and helpful to meet the person you might want to hire! For the day of, we had an intimate elopement with only 3 friends. Stacey made us feel so comfortable and like she had known us for years even though we had just met in person that day! Stacey gave us directions on what to do for the pictures, but not strict posing which made the pictures seem so much more natural, candid, and real. She is a gem of a human and so friendly. After the elopement, Stacey provided us with sneak peeks almost immediately. And when we were delivered the final pictures, we were blown away. Every single picture was PERFECT. We also requested some photos on film, and every single one of those were perfect as well. Could not be happier with choosing Stacey to photograph our day that we’ll remember forever.

## Frequently asked questions

7 Answers

Ask them a question

### Do you have insurance?

I do! Just let me know if your venue requires a certificate of liability, and I’ll send that over to them.

### What’s your back-up plan if you can’t photograph our wedding as planned?

In the very rare event that I’m unable to photograph your wedding, I’ll make sure you’re covered by one of my colleagues or a contracted assistant. I’ll also provide you with a list of photographers from the many networking groups I’m in, so you can find the perfect replacement.

### How many pictures will we get?

You can expect about 50 to 75 images per hour of photography coverage. But keep in mind this estimate varies depending on your wedding package, number of guests, venue type, and other factors.

### How long will it take to see our pictures?

My turnaround time varies by season. Typically, you’ll be able to view your photos online about 12-14 weeks after your wedding during peak wedding season (May-October). I always send a mini gallery of sneak peak photos within 1 week of the day so you can relive the joy!

### Do you also offer video services?

No, I prefer focusing on photography only, so you can get the best wedding pictures possible, as that's where my expertise lies. I can recommend excellent videographers in my network that I would be happy to work with on your special day.

### How far in advance should we book you for our wedding?

Typically, couples book me about 8-12 months before their wedding date. I encourage you to reach out as soon as possible about my availability, even if you’re planning on a shorter time frame. There's a chance you may get lucky and I have an open availability for your date on my calendar!

### Do you work with assistants or other photographers?

Yes! All my packages include a second photographer by default, because I've found it's an invaluable addition to make sure we capture the fullness of your day, and you get all the variety of angles and shots in your gallery you could wish for! I can also always add additional photographers to my team if you have a particularly large or complex day.
