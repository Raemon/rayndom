## About this venue

Driftwood Lodge is a 30-acre private estate on Highway 1 along the Sonoma Coast. We have on-site accommodations in our 5-bedroom main lodge, an activity barn, mini-farm, and acres of private trails and redwood forest to explore. We allow up to 15 guests overnight with 5BR/7BA, a fully stocked kitchen, large common area, 4 jacuzzi tubs, 4 saunas, 6 classic Malm fireplaces and an outdoor hot tub. The 1.5-acre meadow overlooking the ocean is the perfect place for your cocktail hour and ceremony. The large barn opens wide for an indoor/outdoor space for dinner and dancing. You and your guests can enjoy walking through some of the oldest Redwood forests in California down to our creek, lay in the hammock in the meadow or travel just beyond the lodge to a winery, a historic fort, ocean trails, fishing adventures or a round of golf. There are additional, nearby housing accommodations for your guests as well. Create your dream wedding escape!
