Hi, I'm Kelsy. A Northern California native, I have fond memories picking wildflowers as a young girl. Inspired by nature and captivated by each person’s story, I create custom designs for each event with thoughtful attention to every detail. Whether you’ve been scouring Pinterest and know exactly what you want or feel overwhelmed and don’t know where to start, I’m here to help design your dream flowers and create an atmosphere that captivates your guests. After a long distance engagement, planning my own wedding from NYC, I understand the challenges of wedding planning and work hard to make the process as simple and stress-free as possible.

One of the mantras of my business is to love well, one person at a time. Not only do I love to come alongside each couple to provide beautiful flowers and help them bring their vision to life, but a portion of the profits from each wedding supports healing for women and children overcoming the abuses of sex trafficking. Together we can share beauty and healing with the world. Thanks for joining me in this mission.

  * ### Kelsy did a FABULOUS job with our wedding flowers!

•Verified review

•Natalie B.•Jan 8, 2023

She made a stunning spray for the pergola at the ceremony site (so many guests complimented it!) along with beautiful bud vases for the tables, bouquets, and boutonnieres. My bouquet was so gorgeous I almost cried when she brought it in! Even though we really didn't know what kind of flowers we wanted, somehow Kelsey completely captured our wedding vibes with the flowers. She was so patient with us and helped us through the process every step of the way. She was also super responsive to emails and really easy to work with. I would highly recommend Kelsy for wedding florals!

  * ### Amazing Florist!

•Verified review

•Frances M.•Dec 27, 2022

Kelsy was absolutely incredible to work with. I came to Kelsy in a pinch asking her to do my ceremony and table arrangements, bouquets, and to help my family acquire flowers for arrangement they wanted to make a month out from my wedding. Kelsy partnered with us on every detail from start to finish. Her designs were beautiful and she executed our vision perfectly. I would highly recommend Kelsy to design and create your wedding floral arrangements and would definitely work with her again.

  * ### Kelsy was amazing!

•Verified review

•Kristin G.•Oct 16, 2022

Kelsy's florals were absolutely amazing! As somebody who didn't know exactly what they wanted, Kelsy helped us craft our ideal look, and it came out even more stunning than we could have imagined. She was communicative throughout the process, always willing to meet, and was a joy to work with in the lead-up, as well as day of. Hire Kelsy, you won't be disappointed, and thank you!!

  * ### Stunning

•Verified review

•Claire•Jun 25, 2022

Kelsy’s floral arrangements were absolutely STUNNING. I cannot get over how great of a job she did! She executed my vision flawlessly. I had friends who recently got married say my bouquet was the most beautiful bridal bouquet they’ve seen thus far.
