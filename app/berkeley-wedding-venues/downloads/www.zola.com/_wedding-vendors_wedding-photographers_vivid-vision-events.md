My work combines traditional wedding photography with a creative, artistic vision. Each wedding is a unique love story, and my goal is to capture the essence and emotions that define your special day. Published in: The Washington Post, Vogue Italia, Mob Journal, Flanelle Magazine, among others. INTERNATIONAL PRIZES: Photolucida Critical Mass 2022 Finalist, Encontros da Imagem finalist 2022. He received the AAF Jim Shipley Scholarship Award in 2020, NIDA Symposium, Life Framer, The Independent photographer, PDN EDU, Budapest International Photo Awards, Tokyo International Photo Awards and Artslant among others.

My approach goes beyond creating a visual record; every image has a meaning, capturing not just what you see but what you feel, preserving the essence of your love story in a way that words alone cannot convey. I am not just a wedding photographer—I am a storyteller dedicated to creating a beautiful, lasting testament to your love—one that becomes more precious with each passing year.

  * ### Most Magical Moments

•Verified review

•Marlena & N.•Jan 20

Absolutely the best of the best! We hired vivid visions to capture our engagement photos, wedding shower, and wedding. There are no words to perfectly describe how incredible our experience was with Ney and Julia. If you want to feel like close friends are celebrating you while capturing you most magical moments then don’t hesitate and book them ASAP!

  * ### November Wedding

•Verified review

•Alexandra B.•Dec 27, 2024

Vivid Vision Events was a fantastic choice for our wedding photography. From the very first interaction, their communication was great - they were very attentive and quick to respond to any questions or requests we had. On the day of the wedding, the photographer was so helpful and accommodating, even with some last minute changes to the schedule. The quality of their work was excellent - they were clearly very detailed and enthusiastic about capturing all the special moments of our day. We are thrilled with the beautiful, high-quality photos that beautifully reflect the joy and love of our wedding celebration. Vivid Vision Events went above and beyond to ensure our wedding day was perfectly documented, and we highly recommend them to any couple looking for an exceptional photography experience.

  * ### Best day ever!

•Verified review

•Ashley A.•Sep 7, 2024

Ney was amazing throughout the planning process and the day of! We loved our engagement photos and were floored by our wedding photos! He was able to capture a lot of laughs and love through the photos. My husband hates posing for photos, but Ney was able to guide both of us for the perfect picture. Unfortunately our wedding day got rained out by a tropical storm so we weren’t able to take many of the planned photos outside. Ney was super kind and offered to meet up with us after our honeymoon to take those shots that we couldn’t the day of. Forever grateful for that. Thank you so much! We’ll treasure these memories forever!

  * ### Amazing photographer

•Verified review

•Michelle•Sep 7, 2024

It was so much fun to shoot our engagement photos with Nels. Despite how hot it was, he made us feel super comfortable, gave us water, a fan, and made suggestions on poses. And the best part, the pictures and the video are gorgeous! We couldn’t be happier with the results and we 100% recommend him to anyone looking for a photographer.
