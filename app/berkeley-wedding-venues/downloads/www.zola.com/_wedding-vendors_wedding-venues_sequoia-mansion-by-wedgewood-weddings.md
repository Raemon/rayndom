  * ### The best venue EVER

•Verified review

•Hallie C.•Apr 15, 2025

This venue is the absolute best! It's all inclusive! They have partnerships with a florist, a baker, a DJ, officiant, and more so your day can run as smooth as possible! They also make the food there, so no catering is necessary! All you really do is choose exactly what you want for your day and they make it happen. If I had to do it all over again I would choose this place in a heartbeat. While all the other brides around me were stressing over their wedding day, I was relaxing knowing everything was taken care of. I love this place. I need my friends to get married here so I can experience it as a guest!

  * ### Magical 

•Verified review

•Lex•Sep 29, 2024

From the moment we reached out to the team at Sequoia Mansion By Wedgewood Weddings, they were professional, timely, and friendly in their communication. Their spacious and homey venue provided the perfect backdrop for our magical evening, as they were there for us every step of the way, going above and beyond to ensure our special day was nothing short of perfect. Even though we were traveling all the way from Alaska, the Sequoia Mansion team made us feel right at home, and there were plenty of happy tears shed throughout the night as we celebrated our love. We cannot recommend this venue highly enough to any couple looking to create an unforgettable wedding experience.

  * ### Highly recommend!

•Verified review

•Sydney S.•Sep 17, 2024

My husband and I, and all of our wedding guests, had a fantastic experience at Wedgewood’s Sequoia Mansion! Wedgewood makes the entire planning process so easy, and the staff at Sequoia Mansion were so accommodating and friendly throughout the whole thing. Rachel was our day of coordinator and Amy helped us a lot throughout the process as well—we loved them both! From the beginning to end I could go on and on about how awesome everything was. Multiple people raved to us about our wedding being so fun and how the food was so delicious. The bar was also so fun to hang out at. My husband and I had the best day ever and it was all thanks to Sequoia Mansion!

  * ### Just wow!

•Verified review

•Corina C.•Jun 8, 2024
