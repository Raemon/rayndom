  * ### Wedding of our dreams

•Verified review

•Miranda M.•Oct 19, 2025

Saratoga Springs was the perfect wedding venue for our special day. From the moment we first contacted them, their communication was frequent, helpful, thorough, and consistent - they went above and beyond to ensure we felt prepared and supported throughout the planning process. On the day of, their team was incredibly organized and made the setup and cleanup a breeze. The venue itself is absolutely beautiful, with a romantic, natural ambiance that created the perfect backdrop for our wedding. We could not have asked for a better venue and team to bring our vision to life. Saratoga Springs truly made our wedding day feel magical and we are so grateful for their incredible service.

  * ### Best night ever

•Verified review

•Jade B.•Jul 31, 2025

We had our wedding at Saratoga Springs, and it was truly the best night ever. The venue is breathtaking—nestled in a gorgeous natural setting with a perfect mix of rustic charm and romantic elegance. From the moment we booked, we felt completely supported and well taken care of. The team at Saratoga Springs was incredibly thorough, organized, and detail-oriented. Communication was excellent every step of the way, and they really took the time to understand us as a couple and help bring our vision to life. Their professionalism gave us total peace of mind, and everything on the day-of ran so smoothly thanks to them. Not only was the setting beautiful, but the food and drinks were fantastic. Our guests are still talking about how delicious everything was, and the bar service was top-notch. The whole experience—from the ceremony to the last song on the dance floor—was seamless, joyful, and better than we could have imagined. We highly recommend Saratoga Springs to any couple looking for a magical venue with an incredible team. It was everything we hoped for and more.

  * ### Amazing Venue, Staff, and Food.

•Verified review

•Kaitlin M.•Jul 8, 2025

I really loved the staff and the venue. I cannot even count how many times someone has said how gorgeous our venue (cathedral grove) was and how neat the taps are. The food even seemed to have tasted better the day of than at the tasting event Saratoga held which was exciting and a nice surprise. My only complaint is related to the time you have access to the venue and our personal desire to do all photos before the wedding in order to enjoy cocktail hour. Only having access to the venue starting at 3:30 (even for other vendors - ie: florist) really creates a time crunch and the necessity to hire Saratoga staff as helpers. Some items were just being finished or edited as guests arrived and still finishing pre-ceremony photos as they arrived as well. Doing the photos before the ceremony was a big priority for us so we wouldn't miss our own cocktail hour, so if you have that same desire, I would recommend doing portions of the photo list at another location to fit it all in before the ceremony. We have some photos omitted that we didn't realize were never taken until the day after and it was because we rushed off once guests started arriving. I would note, that you do not have any meetings with your day-of coordinator prior to the wedding. I thought the members I had been speaking with (Olivia and Sam) were going to be the one(s) helping us on our day-of and that is not the case. I would have loved a meeting with the day-of coordinator or hired staff to review the decorations and set up instructions. Even with a printed out sheet of where items should go, there were some items that were omitted/misplaced. Of course, as the bride, Im the only one that noticed and as far as the guests are concerned, the wedding went off without a hitch but I would seriously consider the time of arrival at the venue when planning the timeline for the day. Mind you, I had such special and amazing time and this is nitpicking items that stressed me out the day-of.

  * ### Beautiful Venue and Smooth Execution

•Verified review

•Ben X.•Jul 8, 2025

Saratoga Springs is a beautiful venue with a great staff. They helped from the beginning of planning all the way to coordinating on the big day. Everything ran very smoothly between our planned events and vendor coordination. There are lots of extras supplied by the venue for guest entertainment. We loved having our wedding day there and got plenty of compliments from our guests as well.
