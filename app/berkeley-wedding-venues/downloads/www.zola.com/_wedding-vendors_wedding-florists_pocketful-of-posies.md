Welcome. Ever since I can remember I have loved flowers. I have been arranging flowers since 2000 and have created arrangements for weddings, church events, birthday parties, and anniversary celebrations. Being an Event Florist gives me the opportunity to help with life's most important celebrations. To make your day individually unique is something I will help bring to life for any and all of your special events. I pride myself on good service and making sure my clients get what they need to make their day special.

I only do one event a weekend so that I can focus all my attention on that event. This means my calendar fills up quickly. So don't wait too long to call. I don't expect you to come to me so, I will come to you. Once we schedule a consultation, I will meet you at a coffee shop or cafe in your neighborhood. We design with you in mind. If you don't know exactly what you want, we can explore floral options together. Mock-ups and event design is an aspect we will always provide to help you find exactly what will shine for you on your day.

  * ### Beautiful!

•Verified review

•Emma•Nov 2, 2024

Dwuna created a beautiful bouquet and pocket square for our small wedding! She was communicative and clear. When I didn't have an exact idea of what I wanted but gave a few examples of what I like, she created a gorgeous bouquet that fit the vibe of our wedding perfectly, at an affordable price! She also accommodated some changes I made along the way, such as ribbon color and swapping the boutonniere for a pocket square. Pickup went smoothly, and she packaged the bouquet in a smart paper vase with water, which made transport super easy as well.

Response from vendor•Nov 2, 2024

Thanks, Emma. It was a joy to work with you. I am so happy you loved your bouquet. I had fun with all of the bright colors.

## Frequently asked questions

5 Answers

Ask them a question

### Do you have a minimum spend for weddings?

We do not have a minimum, as we know weddings needs can differ from event to event. Once we sit down, we will talk through your floral needs, and find a price point that can work in your budget while creating the floral design you desire.

### What should we expect at our consultation? Do we need to bring anything?

Consultations last approximately 1 hour but can take up to 2 for larger weddings. Please come prepared with details about your wedding like your budget and style, as well as any inspiration you have for your wedding flowers. This can include images of your venue, photos of your wedding attire, fabric swatches, your color palette, photos from social media, and more. The more information and ideas you provide, the better I can assist you. After your consultation, we will draw up a proposal with prices and email it to you.

### Can you provide any decor other than flowers?

Yes! We offer a variety of rentals for an additional cost from aisle runners to candelabras, arches, glassware, lighting arrangements, and more. Get in touch to see our full list.

### What flowers are in season for our wedding?

During your consultation, we will go over all the gorgeous in-season floral offerings available for your wedding date. We love supporting local growers and regional flowers and greenery!

### Do you handle flower breakdown after the ceremony?

Yes, we offer breakdown services along with delivery, set up, and flower transfer from the ceremony to the reception.
