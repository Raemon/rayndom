  * ### Fantastic Moments

•Verified review

•Stephany•Dec 24, 2025

Sam was awesome at keeping the dance floor packed all night! He rolled with the punches on the schedule changes we tossed his way and helped out with coordinating everything. He even went the extra mile to edit our first dance song so it matched our choreography perfectly. His sound system worked great for our outdoor venue, too. Plus, he was super communicative in the lead-up to the wedding and reached out to us when we were super busy with last-minute prep, which was really helpful.

Response from vendor•Dec 28, 2025

Thank you, Stephany. I hope you are having a pleasant holiday season with your family and friends.

  * ### Very Organized and Attentive

•Verified review

•Matthew•Nov 25, 2025

Sam did an amazing job keeping the dance floor moving. He kept the floor full all night, handled on-the-fly changes (that we made) in scheduling, and helped coordinate the night. He went above and beyond editing our first dance song so that it would fit our choreography. His sound system handled our outdoor venue like a champ. He was an excellent communicator leading up to the wedding and was proactive with messaging us, which was extremely helpful when we were swamped in the last-minute wedding prep.

Response from vendor•Nov 25, 2025

Thank you, Matthew. It was a real pleasure to be part of your big day and celebrate with your loved ones.

  * ### Lifesaver :) 

•Verified review

•Monica C.•Nov 23, 2025

DJ Sam was a lifesaver! I found him online, by chance, and was charmed by his willingness to go above and beyond in less than a week from my event to create mp3 audio tracks for me to sing over, to research and create a Baroque playlist appropriate for the castle setting my event occurred in, to include a surprise recording of my brother playing sax that was inserted to see if my brother would recognize himself in the playlist mix, and to create a fun dance playlist that got my guests hopping and cutting the marble floor in their elegant ballroom attire!!!! What a magical, majestic, magnificent memory Sam helped me create. I will not be losing his contact and I highly recommend him for ANY event you need a PA/audio/DJ for!!! Thank you so much, Sam!

Response from vendor•Nov 23, 2025

Thank you so much, Monica. I really appreciate you including me in your fun event.

  * ### Lots of Energy

•Verified review

•Delaney•Nov 17, 2025

Response from vendor•Nov 23, 2025

Thanks a bunch, Delaney and Carson! Wishing you both all the best, and I really appreciate you trusting me to DJ your wedding.
