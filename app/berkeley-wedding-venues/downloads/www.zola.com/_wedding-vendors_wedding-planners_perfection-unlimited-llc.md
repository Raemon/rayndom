  * ### Honest pros and cons 

•Verified review

•Annabelle•Oct 5, 2025

We hired this planning team for our wedding because they offered an affordable package, and we appreciated that Matthew was professional, hard-working, and had a great attitude throughout. He worked very hard on the day of and ensured that cleanup went smoothly, which we were very grateful for. We also appreciated that we were able to coordinate the rentals through their company which was one of the major reasons we went with them. However, our experience with the lead coordinator, Meshawn, left a lot to be desired. During several of our meetings, she appeared distracted—often taking our zoom meetings on her phone while in the passenger seat of a car—and rarely came prepared with notes or a clear agenda. Despite repeatedly asking what we should be planning or thinking about, we often left meetings without much direction. This led to a stressful final week before the wedding, where many details were suddenly brought up last minute. On the wedding day, there were several issues that made things more stressful than they should have been. Meshawn did not have a positive attitude day of and was at one point rude to my mother. There were also organizational problems—our family photos had to be taken in an alternate location because the original space wasn’t ready, and there were major hiccups with the dessert setup and technology. The photo booth broke early in the night and had to be fixed by one of our guests. The team seemed unprepared to troubleshoot basic tech issues. We also ran out of alcohol and ice midway through the evening, and some of our guests had to leave the venue to get more. Bar service was slow, with long lines and delayed drinks, which impacted the overall guest experience. Additionally, I was asked questions about my wedding dress multiple times in front of my husband—something that should have been handled more discreetly. While there were definitely some positive aspects, the overall lack of organization and professionalism made parts of the experience more stressful than they needed to be. I hope this feedback is taken constructively, as I believe there is potential for improvement.

Meshawn was such a fantastic coordinator and we got so much value for the price with the day-of coordination package. She followed up with me every month leading up to the wedding to make sure the planning and vendor bookings were on track and. She also helped a ton with planning the full schedule for the day and had a good sense of how long each thing would take. And on the day-of she put out sooo many fires- unexpected guests showing up, adding an extra reception table, grabbing the vows that I forgot in the car last minute, coordinating with all the vendors. And every event was exactly on time and perfectly smooth. Even if you're doing a mostly DIY or budget wedding- day-of coordination is sooo worth it and I highly recommend Perfection Unlimited. They're super professional, calm, and kind. So grateful to their team for all their hard work.

  * ### Coordination for film screening surprise wedding

•Verified review

•Roni M.•May 3, 2024

Meshawn and the team at Perfection Unlimited were our Coordination team for our October 2023 wedding. We could not have asked for a better team to coordinate our unique wedding ceremony that was a surprise to our guests. After connecting with PU via Thumbtack back in mid-2023, we spoke with Matthew who immediately understood the importance of our vision. Our wedding was held at the New Parkway Theater in Oakland, Ca. It started off as a friends and family screening of a short film (the Bride was the director, the Groom was a crew member). Then, during the post-film Q&A, we revealed to our guests that we were getting married right then and there in the theater. Not only did PU coordinate a film screening complete with red carpet, step & repeat photos, food, drink, DJ and more, but they helped transition into a full wedding ceremony. Meshawn ran point on everything: rehearsal, procession, recession, cake, etc. Stellar team members, Angel and Rakisha, executed everything flawlessly. Angel acted as the special events coordinator, making sure our tech was on point (sound, picture, graphics, everything!) and she even made a reel for us to post on our socials. PU was up for the challenge of our 2-in-1 surprise wedding/film screening, and they rose to that challenge with much aplomb. For what we asked for, they could've up-charged us greatly. PU made us feel heard and seen throughout the process. We wanted our wedding to be a collaboration between BIPOC businesses and creators celebrating what we can achieve when we work together. Thanks to PU for what they promised, perfection.
