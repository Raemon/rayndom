## About this venue

As a family of passionate restaurateurs, we realize we earn our reputation one event, one meal, and one gesture at a time. Our goal is to ensure your experience is one that you and your guests will truly enjoy. Modeled after the Colosseum in Rome, California Memorial Stadium (est. 1923) is an enduring symbol of the University of California campus - home to many of the greatest moments in the history of Cal Athletics. Designed by renowned architect John Galen Howard and originally opened in the fall of 1923, Memorial Stadium underwent seismic renovations in Dec. 2010 to bring the facility up to modern standards - all while maintaining the architecture and character of the celebrated structure. Neighboring a plush wall of pine trees in the Berkeley Hills to the east, with a million-dollar panoramic view of the San Francisco Bay Area to the west and stunning sights of the Richmond Bridge, the Bay Bridge and the famed Golden Gate Bridge! The perfect spot for your next event!
