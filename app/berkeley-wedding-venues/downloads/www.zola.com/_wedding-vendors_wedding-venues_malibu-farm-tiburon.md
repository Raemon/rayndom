•Verified review

•Olivia R.•Nov 26, 2025

I wanted to share my positive experience working with the team at Malibu Farm Tiburon for my wedding party. They were incredibly transparent regarding expectations and exceptionally patient throughout the entire planning process. The venue space was stunning, right on the water with a view of San Francisco, featuring an open-air design and modern build-out. The quality of the food was outstanding; it was noticeably fresh, and the high-quality ingredients were evident. The cocktails were also a highlight, with the Watermelon Cocktail being a particular fan favorite of the crowd. I highly recommend Malibu Farm for anyone looking to host a wedding or event on the waterfront.
