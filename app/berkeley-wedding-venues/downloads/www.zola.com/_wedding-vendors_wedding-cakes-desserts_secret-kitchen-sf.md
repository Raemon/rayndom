I really love cakes and desserts. Like, I REALLY love them! I have professional training in the tastiest pastry areas: from chocolates to caramels, classic to modern European cakes. The wedding dessert table is the happiest place in the world, and my aim is to provide that for your big day.

To my clients I offer European flavors and floral buttercream cakes. Unlike most wedding cakes you can buy, mine are not just gorgeous, they are DELICIOUS. Not overly sweet, and filled with unique flavors.

  * ### THE TASTIEST MOST BEAUTIFUL CAKE!

•Verified review

•Lydia P.•Mar 22, 2025

I contacted Elena to make the cake and desserts for my engagement party after seeing her work on Instagram. Besides my dress, I think the most compliments I received that night were for the desserts which I didn’t even make! Thank you, Elena for the BEAUTIFUL cake you made and for those scrumptious tiramisu tasting cups. I think I ate 3 of them before the party even started! The cake was tasty and so pretty, everyone wanted to take photos of it! Elena made the whole process of ordering a breeze. We talked over Zoom where I showed her the place (my fiancé’s parents’ backyard) and we discussed colors, flavors, and pricing. She had the cake delivered on time in a nice box, and made sure the caterers knew how to set it up and cut it into enough servings for everyone. I highly recommend Elena for any party and I’m looking forward to working with her on my wedding cake!!!

  * ### A Vegan Masterpiece: “Bird’s Milk” Cake 

•Verified review

•Alena E.•Feb 24, 2025

As a long-time vegan, I was thrilled to discover a homemade vegan version of the legendary "Bird's Milk" Cake. The name symbolizes something rate and precious, derived from Slavic myths where it represents an unattanble delicacy. Elena's execution of this cake is truly impressive. The airy texture reminiscent of traditional milk, but with a lighter, more refreshing quality perfectly captures the essence of the original while using plant-based ingredients. The flavor was subtly sweet and slightly nutty (coconut), complementing the cake beautifully, without overpowering it. The chocolate glaze added a luxurious touch, making it a delight for both vagans and non-vegans alike. This is a must-try for anyone looking to experience the magic of vegan baking!

  * ### Delicious and authentic honey cake 

•Verified review

•Rudabeh P.•Feb 20, 2025

Secret Kitchen SF was a pleasure to work with for a birthday cake. They were very easy to communicate with throughout the entire process, and were responsive to all of our questions and requests. The final cake was absolutely delicious - it was fresh, moist, and perfectly executed. We got the cake for a Ukrainian colleague and he said it was perfect and exactly what he was hoping for. The value was excellent and they truly exceeded our expectations.

  * ### Exquisite Cakes

•Verified review

•David•Feb 16, 2025

Secret Kitchen SF was an absolute pleasure to work with. From the very first interaction, their communication was timely and professional, making the ordering process seamless. Their level of craftsmanship is truly unparalleled - they created a personalized cake featuring our favorite fruit that was not only beautiful, but also outrageously delectable in flavor. I have ordered from Secret Kitchen SF several times in the past and have never been disappointed in the quality, attention to detail . We highly recommend them to any couple planning their special day.
