  * ### Flower wall was a hit!

•Verified review

•Ashley M.•Jan 6, 2026

The Backdrop Babe was an absolute dream to work with for our wedding!. The team was professional, meticulous, and attentive throughout the entire process, making it so easy for us. They answered all of my questions and the final product was stunning - the flower wall was absolutely beautiful, with such a lush, full look that everyone kept asking if the flowers were real. I've seen other flower walls in the past that looked flat, but this one had so much extra "fluff" and dimension. We couldn't be happier with the Backdrop Babe's work and would highly recommend them to any couple planning their wedding!

  * ### An amazing addition to our event
