We are so happy with how our sneak peek pictures turned out and we can’t wait to see more! She was so professional and made sure we stayed on schedule the whole time. We unfortunately had rain before the ceremony & she was resilient and found other areas we could photograph in. She was awesome at giving us direction but also letting us have ideas for poses & what we would like as well. Our favorite part was being able to take pictures in the golf cart we found! Highly recommend Natalie! It also helps she is just so nice & bubbly! Thank you, Natalie! We were so lucky to have you & make our day even more perfect!!

I am an elopement and wedding photographer based in Northern California, who shoots for the fun quirky weirdos who are unabashedly themselves. I capture the perfection that you are while having a laugh and (almost assuredly) crying along while you read your vows. My name is Katelyn and I want to meet you!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“My husband and I used Katelyn to take our engagement photos around Golden Gate Park and Mt Tam area. We were able to cover a few different locations and do a couple outift changes. Katelyn is so easy to work with! She made us feel comfortable and gave us space to enjoy each other while she stepped back and captured it all!”Shannon+Dillon, 5 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/katelyn-tucker-photography)

I started shooting photos and video in Greece, and since moving to the US, I have dedicated myself to shooting weddings, elopements and engagements.

We hired her for our wedding and she was so professional and fun to work with. My family, bridal party and guest loved her! Vic had us laughing the entire time and made us feel comfortable with posing and suggested us the best ideas too. After a week or 2 after the wedding we got our photos and they were breathtaking!! Most photos I didn’t realized she captured since she was so quick on her feet. It looks like there was 3 photographers since she got all angles from the ceremony, speeches, and dances. We are so impressed by how amazing she is.

Weddings by Katherine Marchand 5.0 Oakland, CA

  * Editorial style
  * Starts at $4,000 

I'm Katherine, a wedding photographer based in Oakland, CA. With over a decade of experience and features in Vogue, Brides, The New York Times, and more, I know how to create wedding photos that don’t just look stunning — they feel like you. No trendy filters, no forced poses, just authentic moments that reflect who you are. I believe the best moments aren’t staged. They unfold naturally, in the quiet glances, the belly laughs, and those unspoken connections shared with your loved ones. My goal is to capture those raw, in-between moments that truly make your wedding day yours!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Holy smokes! If you're looking for a photographer in California/Bay Area who's not just talented but an absolute blast to work with, look no further. We just had our engagement shoot, and let me tell you, Katherine is the real deal. Her personality is so infectious, we forgot we were even doing a photoshoot. Before we knew it, we were laughing, being silly, and just having fun with what felt like an old friend. She asked us all the right questions that made us feel at ease and boy, did it show in the photos. TLDR? If you don't book her, you're missing out big time.

I’m Cherlyn (rhymes with Berlin). So nice to e-meet you! If we met in person and it wasn’t during a pandemic- I would probably hug you! I’m an introvert-extrovert and tend to ramble too much when I get nervous. In emails - I tend to use exclamation points a lot!! (and will agonize over my drafts of emails before sending them because they probably have one too many!!) My aim as your photographer is to provide a memorable experience where you two feel comfortable, taken care of, and get to fully enjoy your wedding day as much as possible with all your guests & loved ones - whether they be in real life or via livestream!![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Cherlyn captured our elopement in November 2024 at Timber Cove Inn. Since this was a second wedding for both of us, and was very small (just us and our kids) we wanted to keep things simple, focusing on the beauty of the landscape with a simple, sweet ceremony. Cherlyn absolutely nailed it - she captured the vibe we were going for perfectly and the photos are absolutely stunning! I could not be happier with the photos and the experience as a whole. She made us so comfortable and that led to great photos where we look at ease, which is just how we felt.”Kristin B., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/7893b11a-df00-49c4-ad9d-636b8388d7cc?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/c-wagner-photography-design-llc)

Reenie Raschke Photography 5.0 Oakland, CA

  * Editorial style
  * Starts at $500 

Thirty years documenting our beautiful people, from set up portraiture to long lens candids. I know how to tell a moving and beautiful story. The wonderful part of living in the Bay Area is the diversity I experience and the divine rituals we share as a people. I've traveled to many countries to collect these precious moments. My heart is enormous, my prices still quite reasonable.“Reenie Raschke Photography was an amazing find for our wedding day! Reenie was available consistently and was easily reachable throughout the entire planning process. Her work is truly stunning and breathtaking, with incredible attention to detail. When we first met Reenie, it felt as if we had known her forever - she is so open, honest, friendly, and professional. Reenie gave her all to every detail, and truly made my daughter and her new husband feel so special on their big day. I cannot stress enough what a wonderful photographer Reenie is - her work is simply amazing!”Laura W., 2 days ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/reenie-raschke-photography)

Amanda Goldsmith Photography 5.0 Oakland, CA

  * Photojournalistic style
  * Starts at $4,000 

I’ve been photographing weddings for five years, mostly on film. My background in art, landscape architecture, and graphic design shapes how I approach photographing weddings, from light and composition to the details that make each wedding unique. For me, wedding photography is about being present and noticing fleeting, meaningful, and joyful moments as well as the elements that give your day its character. I move through the day with curiosity, joy, and care, letting it unfold naturally so the images feel soulful, expressive, and alive.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“From the moment we first spoke with Amanda, her relaxed, funny, and warm personality instantly put us at ease. She is the perfect blend of professional and personable - Amanda fit right in with our friends and family on the wedding day, and somehow was everywhere at once to capture all the little moments we didn't even get to see. She is pure magic when it comes to capturing candid moments. The photos she delivered are truly artful, timeless, and beautifully document our special day. We couldn't be happier with our wedding photos, and highly recommend Amanda to any couple looking for a talented, personable wedding photographer who uses film as a main tool of documentation.”Chelsea, 3 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/amanda-goldsmith-photography)

  * Fine art style
  * Starts at $4,000 

I'm a fine art wedding photographer based in Northern California and beyond. After discovering my love for photography, I always knew I wanted to become a full time wedding photographer. I am so fortunate to call this my job for over five years! My photography work often describe as romantic, soft, bright and natural that lend itself from my love of film look and fine art. When I'm not behind the camera or editing the latest wedding, you can find me spending time with my wife and our two Tabbies. I would absolutely love to get to know you and be your photographer!“Ditto and his assistant showed up early and started taking amazing photos right off the bat. The pre-wedding communication was timely. He was easy to work with and brought calm energy to a day when stress can permeate the fun out of it. We immediately received a high volume, beautiful sneak peak the evening after the wedding which was a fun surprise and a great way to start our honeymoon admiring the gorgeous photos. If you are considering Ditto Diante Photography for your wedding, I would highly recommend him.”Mariah O., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/9d286157-fc2c-4981-9d16-cf7088eba45c?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/ditto-dianto-photography)

Want a trusted, unobtrusive, thoughtful pro photographer friend on your wedding day? Someone to capture the way the wedding FEELS as well as it looks. A little direction during portrait time, a little leadership during family portraits, and near invisibility all other times? I think you’re onto something. I’m in. What's exciting? What’s important? What's confusing? Let’s sit down for a discovery meeting and I’ll ask, listen, lay out options, and share suggestions. I want to learn about you. I'm on your team 100% before, during, and after your wedding. Bonus: I've shot 400+ practice weddings before yours and I absolutely LOVE what I do!“Olivia was incredible!!! The preparation leading up to our wedding was so easy and Olivia really took the time to get to know us and learn what moments we didn’t want her to miss during our wedding. We didn’t need to worry about a thing on our big day. She was very organized and allowed me and Josh to enjoy the day with full confidence she was snapping all the right pics!

Offbeat Photography with a Narrative Twist. I've been having fun photographing weddings for over 18 years. I find the excitement, nervousness, love, and joy inspiring to create great photographs that tell a story. I have been in love with photography since I've been a kid.

  * Serves Oakland, CA

Hi, I'm Christina Hernandez, and I am passionate about emotional, documentary photography. After working 15 years as a staff photojournalist at the San Francisco Chronicle, I've taken my years of experience to create rich, memorable images for my couples. My goal is to create a photo gallery that tells YOUR story. You are unique and your images should be, too. I cry at weddings. I can't help it! I get emotionally invested and I won't apologize for it. It allows me to get into the zone where I am completely immersed in the moment and I strive to make images that reflect that. I love being inspired by new locations, and I go with the flow.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Christina was amazing, her photos are beautiful and she is so wonderful to work with! We didn't really know what wedding photos we wanted specifically, and she just curated us and the photos, and they turned out brilliantly. She isn’t intrusive during the ceremony, we didn’t even notice her and nor did our guests -yet there were so many photos! She is very responsive to emails, texts and calls. She does great check-ins and even asked if we needed help with anything the day before.

My name is Thomas Seabury I am a wedding photographer of 9 years, over the past 5 years shooting just over 100 weddings per year. Each wedding I take on the roll of coordinator, photographer, and personal assistant keeping the entire day running smoothly and keeping the stress of the day as far from the bride and groom as possible. I would love to be a huge part of your entire process from overall planning to execution of the day! In the off chance you're booking at a Northern CA Wedgewood venue, I have hundreds of hours of experience at each of their venues and work very closely with the everyone of the staff at Wedgewood.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Thomas is the most amazing photographer/artist/ just coolest human. From the start, their communication was efficient, friendly, and incredibly organized. He's not just a wedding photographer, he's a true artist and his professional work is simply perfect. He knew exactly where to shoot and how to use the lighting to capture all the best moments. One of my favorite things about our wedding was getting to know Thomas and seeing his magical work in real time. He's also so good at improvising at time of stress and I honestly don't know how he does it. The number one compliment we kept getting from our guests/family was how amazing our photographer was - so many people raved about him and he was easily our favorite vendor. Everyone was still talking about him long after the wedding was over. Thomas you are amazing. Thank you so much for making our magical day even more magical.”Nanna T., 2 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/849b4cce-f0c4-49a8-9dcb-626aa96575d1?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/twentythreeninteen)

Hi! I'm Anna the founder and senior photographer of Hey Honey Photography. I am a Texas-born, California girl at heart. I reside in the San Francisco Bay Area, and have a team of talented wedding photographers with a passion for capturing your life’s biggest moments and all your candid in betweens.

She was an excellent communicator even through COVID and our wedding date shifting multiple times. We could not be happier with our wedding photos, we are absolutely obsessed!

She not only photographed every detail, she also surprised us with a very sweet card and a sneak peek of our photos with some beautiful polaroids she took that brought us to tears. We absolutely loved working with Anna, she was very professional, sweet, and her work is amazing. We also used her services for our engagement photos and they came out beautifully as well.

The candid moments especially, were some of our favorites. When we received the teaser film and the photos, Meredith and I were left speechless.

The final gallery looks like something out of an editorial spread — soft, ethereal, and full of warmth and joy. We still can’t get over how magical the photos are.

Hannah Berglund Photography 5.0

  * Photojournalistic style
  * Starts at $10,500 
  * Serves Oakland, CA

I'm Hannah, a full time wedding and portrait photographer in Livermore, California. To me, photography is so much more than just hiring another vendor. And that's why you should choose someone you truly love to work with! I believe the real magic happens during the in-between moments – a secret smile shared by the parents; a tearful hug with the maid of honor; a quirky moment with the best man. These memories are far more precious than any staged photo, and these are the memories I want to capture for you on your big day.![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“Hannah is not only an amazing photographer, but also a great person to be around. If you're getting married, you definitely want someone with Hannah's energy and positivity to be around all day, because I promise that will reflect in your photos !”Richa Parekh, 5 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/hannah-berglund-photography)

Follow me on Instagram *vanessamontanophotography I’m Vanessa—Bay Area born and raised, living my dream under the California sun with a camera always close by. When I’m not documenting life’s beautiful moments, I’m likely in the kitchen testing new recipes, catching up with friends over a dirty martini, cruising with country music turned up, or spending time with my family. Photography isn’t just my work—it’s something I truly love. I feel incredibly grateful to witness and capture so many meaningful stories.“We are so happy we had the opportunity to have Vanessa capture our special day! The quality of her work is exceptional, with beautiful colors and candid moments filled with love. Vanessa constantly checked in to make sure we got the shots we wanted, and went above and beyond to focus on capturing the special interactions between our family and friends. We couldn't be happier with the final photos - they truly helped make our special day even more memorable.”Kennedy M., a month ago![](https://images.zola.com/fd73e18a-e886-4a7f-819f-837485892581?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-photographers/vanessa-m-photography)
