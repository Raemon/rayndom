Want a trusted, unobtrusive, thoughtful pro photographer friend on your wedding day? Someone to capture the way the wedding FEELS as well as it looks. A little direction during portrait time, a little leadership during family portraits, and near invisibility all other times? I think you’re onto something. I’m in. What's exciting? What’s important? What's confusing? Let’s sit down for a discovery meeting and I’ll ask, listen, lay out options, and share suggestions. I want to learn about you. I'm on your team 100% before, during, and after your wedding. Bonus: I've shot 400+ practice weddings before yours and I absolutely LOVE what I do!

I think I'm supposed to mention about being in the Wedding Photographer Hall of Fame, the 100+ 5-star thrilled client testimonials (many of whom are still friends), the art degree, & at 6’3” tall I’m a walking flattering angle, but truly it’s about you both feeling totally comfortable, in-the-moment, and completely happy on your wedding day. I enjoy getting to know my couples as friends. Let's sit down together (or via video chat) to get your good questions answered & ensure you feel both informed and excited about your photography experience. This translates to an ease and effortlessness as you completely relax and enjoy your wedding day.

  * ### Didn’t Even Feel Like Photography (in a good way)

•Verified review

•Baylee C.•Nov 5, 2025

Working with Olivia Smartt Photography was an absolute delight from start to finish. Her communication was always timely and extremely helpful. She truly listened to our vision and priorities, and was able to capture exactly what we were hoping for. The quality of her work was outstanding, with a very detailed and organized approach that made us feel at ease throughout the process. As a queer couple who aren't usually fond of being photographed, Olivia made us feel incredibly comfortable, to the point where it barely even felt like we were being photographed. Olivia has a wonderful talent for making you forget the camera is even there, gently guiding us to talk and interact with each other in a natural way. The end result was a beautiful collection of candid, joyful moments that perfectly reflect our special day. We couldn't be happier and would recommend Olivia Smartt Photography to any couple looking for an exceptional and natural photography experience.

  * ### Stellar!

•Verified review

•Michael M.•Apr 3, 2023

We found Olivia to be a wonderful, skilled photographer! Her eye for composition is creative, yet she demonstrated the connectiveness of us as a couple. The one thing that stands out is how Olivia totally put us at ease by using innovative ways to relax us as we were posing. She had us, as we were holding a position close to each other, to tell each other 3 things we love and appreciate about each other. This of course brought smiles and was totally relaxing and sincere. She made us so relaxed and comfortable . As a result , the photos look completely natural. We actually became engaged the afternoon, immediately after these photos were taken. She made the moment so relaxing and magical. It was serendipity. I recommend her highly, and will be spreading the word amongst my friends and contacts. We will treasure these photos forever.

  * ### Wedding Photographer

•Verified review

•Christina & J.•Mar 2, 2022

Olivia was incredible!!! The preparation leading up to our wedding was so easy and Olivia really took the time to get to know us and learn what moments we didn’t want her to miss during our wedding. We didn’t need to worry about a thing on our big day. She was very organized and allowed me and Josh to enjoy the day with full confidence she was snapping all the right pics! We also got them back in record time! Only two weeks after the wedding! We would highly recommend Olivia if you are looking for a photographer who is professional, fun, easy going and super talented!

## Frequently asked questions

5 Answers

Ask them a question

### Do you work with a second photographer?

About 70% of my weddings are photographed by me alone, as I truly enjoy wedding photography & I'm energized by this work. I love being calm, cool, and collected while being everywhere at once and thinking ahead. I help my couples plan their wedding day timelines so that you have the experience that you want to have while also capturing as many or few of the portraits that you'd like. For weddings with (1) Over 150 guests, (2) Important events happening at the same time in different locations, or (3) those dripping with decor, we can add in a 2nd photog from my experienced & talented team of pro photographer friends.

### Will you edit all our pictures?

Definitely. I care deeply about the true-to-life color of each individual image as well as the cohesive look of the chapters and gallery as a whole. You won't see over-saturated, trendy, or unrealistic editing styles from my work. When you look at your wedding album in 10, 20, or 30 years, I want you to smile and maybe laugh at the styles of clothing or perhaps your choice of decor -- NOT the outdated and then-trendy color editing of your photographer. :) lately there is a lot of marketing buzz about AI editing, but unfortunately it really isn't there yet -- if you want True to Life Color.

### How many pictures will we get?

The short answer is that you'll get all of The Good Ones. You don't need to pay more to receive all of the memories and moments. :) This averages about 70-100 images an hour, with variation for number of guests, family portrait and group shot list, and locations -- or scenes/settings/chapters. You also won't receive too many to sort through. I/we do our best to get a great photo of everyone in attendance. We can't guarantee this, but I definitely have this overarching goal. You want to remember everyone that was able to make it -- your favorite and most special family and friends. :)

### What’s your back-up plan if you can’t photograph our wedding as planned?

In the highly unlikely event that I am eaten by a bear on the way to your wedding, I have an up-to-date phone and email list of emergency backup photographers. This is provided to you and your planner a month before your wedding and starts with my main 3 associate photographers, my main assistant (of over 10 years), and my husband who is also a talented photographer + very helpful in a pinch. With 13 years of photographing weddings in the Bay Area & Wine Country, I have a prized network of helpful & talented professional photog friends and we all help one another. I also aim to arrive early & to text you as an FYI when I'm on site. :)

### Do you have insurance?

I do, and this is an important question to ask all of the photographers and other vendors that you're speaking with. It's one of the many important aspects of being a trusted, experienced professional. I'm happy to send over a certificate of liability insurance for your venue.
