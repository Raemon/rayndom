“The pricing on here is wrong. The venue fee alone is almost 30k. Then the food and beverage minimum is 50k but if you have 150 guests you will spend more like 80k. Plus there is a service fee of at least 13k. So BEFORE photographer, footwear, videographer, band, decor etc. you’re already at around 123k.”Jane, 2 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/stanly-ranch)

![Awarded Best of Zola](https://d1tntvpcrzvon2.cloudfront.net/vmassets/_next/static/media/best_of_zola-bb22ffb7c600152112f7.png)“We recently had our wedding at Suisun Valley Inn, and overall, it was a beautiful and memorable experience. One of the biggest highlights was being able to use the venue for three full days, which gave us extra time to relax and connect with our bridal party and loved ones. That extended access truly made a difference in how special the weekend felt. However, there were a few challenges that did impact our plans. The event barn, which was a key part of our original vision, was unfortunately not finished in time for our wedding. While we understand this was out of the owner’s control, we were disappointed that we were not refunded the full 2,000 deposit, especially since the change affected nearly every aspect of our day. Additionally, when we arrived, we were surprised to find the vineyard had been plowed without any prior notice. This forced another last-minute adjustment to our setup so we wouldn’t be facing a dirt lot. It would have been really helpful to have been told about that in advance. Despite these hiccups, the venue itself has so much potential and charm, and we did have a lovely wedding. I just hope some of these experiences can help future couples plan better or spark a few improvements from the venue for the future.”Analisa R., 8 months ago![](https://images.zola.com/024bd0c3-3769-4479-be04-a31009a3418e?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/suisun-valley-inn-at-monroe-ranch)

“We used Flying Cloud Farm for our October wedding, and it was absolutely perfect! The venue is stunning—offering both beautiful indoor and outdoor spaces surrounded by horses, chickens, and the occasional wildlife visitor, which added such a charming touch. Our coordinator, Julia, made everything feel effortless. She truly knows every detail of what it takes to plan the perfect event and executed everything flawlessly on the big day. The newly expanded bridal suite is gorgeous—spacious, elegant, and ideal for getting ready and capturing those special bridal photos. We also had iffy weather leading up to our wedding, and Julia had a seamless backup plan ready to go just in case. Knowing they were completely prepared for rain gave us such peace of mind, and their flexibility ensured everything would have been just as beautiful no matter what the forecast decided to do. We couldn’t recommend Flying Cloud Farm more highly for any special event.

“My wife and I held our wedding at Landmark in August 2024. Olivia was great to work with and the wedding itself was perfect and went off without a hitch. We loved the landscaping and ambiance of the venue, with its views of vineyards overlooking the Mayacamas, which provided the perfect backdrop for our 50 person ceremony. The beautiful flowers and outdoor furniture also helped us save a bit on other parts of our budget -- the space is so nice that it doesn't need too much done to it. We also liked the cottage and suite onsite, which are a nice perk. Landmark is definitely worth visiting if you are looking for a fantastic wine country venue!”Jay T., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/e69d0230-d260-4141-ad8a-a286b8b504df?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/landmark-vineyards)

“The Gables Wine Country Inn was the perfect venue for our wedding. It had an intimate vibe and had such a variety of beautiful atmospheric additions too such as: a charming historic barn, redwood trees, winery, and Victorian building in the backdrop, it couldn't have been better. Pam & Larry (the owners and managers of Gables Wine Country Inn) were so kind when we came to them for a last minute wedding and were so flexible and adaptable with the things we wanted for our wedding. They were extremely helpful in giving us our perfect day: the decor was gorgeous, the venue amazing, food & drink was the best and our guests had a great time too. It was a very easy planning process and they were very easy going about our wishes so I highly recommend this venue for a wedding, it was a wonderful experience and they couldn't have made the stress of planning a wedding any easier. It was a beautiful day and we have wonderful memories and photos of it forever, I couldn't be happier with it!”Holly and J., 5 years ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/the-gables-wine-country-inn)

“Farmstead at Long Meadow Ranch was the perfect venue for our intimate, 17-person, post-ceremony wedding lunch. We had the outdoor patio area all to ourselves and it was absolutely gorgeous, and so well-maintained! From the moment we reached out to Farmstead, the team was detailed, polite, and positive in their communication, making the planning process as seamless as could be expected. Farmstead was also really flexible in allowing us to bring our own decorations, which was so great, and truly helped our vision come to life. The food and drinks were fresh and absolutely delicious! It made all the difference to us that Farmstead was able to nimbly accommodate all of our guests' dietary preferences in a way that ensured people ate healthily and deliciously, especially for those who traveled from far away. We are so grateful to the Farmstead team for helping make our special day unforgettable. Thank you so much!”Alexandra S., 8 months ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/farmstead-at-long-meadow-ranch)

“We had the wedding reception of our dreams this July! We were drawn to having our 110-person reception at D'Argenzio Winery for countless reasons including great price and a truly beautiful location. Breanna had excellent, understanding, and flexible communication with us for the entire year leading up to our wedding day. We rented the Terrazzo Patio and Tasting Room Lounge and had open seating for the guests so that they could choose to sit inside or outside! Everyone enjoyed the wine, Prosecco, beer, and soft drink offerings at the bar. We absolutely loved Cibo Rustico's catering of antipasto boards, salads, pasta, and chicken offerings. We also had a banda perform late into the night on the bocce ball court following dinner, speeches, and the first dance! You too can have the wedding you always dreamed of at D'Argenzio Winery!”Emma R., a year ago](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/d-argenzio-winery)

“Paradise Ridge was absolutely stunning for our wedding! Even though it rained all day unexpectedly, the venue was just breathtaking. The only thing I would definitely change is that they have ceremonies start at 6pm and receptions end at 11pm- I wish we would've either added the optional hour to go to midnight or rented the space out to start earlier since everyone was having a ton of fun and it felt like the dancing didn't last as long as some other weddings we've been to. The staff was professional and knowledgable, and we didn't have any problems day of. They also have chairs and tables for 150 people included, which was great when making the rental order. Overall, PRW was fantastic.”Shelby L., a year ago![](https://images.zola.com/d4b50d18-12bf-48cb-a817-dece0c49021e?w=160&h=120&fit=crop&q=60&fm=webp)](/wedding-vendors/wedding-venues/paradise-ridge-winery)

## About wedding venues in Richmond, CA

### 

California offers an incredible 840 miles of coastline, 3,000+ wineries and ancient redwoods for your wedding day. When you choose the Golden State, you're getting exceptional natural lighting for your ceremony across diverse settings from Mediterranean coastal zones to alpine mountain backdrops. Each region has its own distinctive character that can perfectly match your vision.

### What Makes California Wedding Venues So Special?

Northern California's Napa Valley welcomes you with rolling vineyards and Spanish colonial architecture where intimate wine cave ceremonies create unforgettable moments. Head to Southern California and you'll find oceanfront venues like Duke's Malibu where you can exchange vows with the Pacific stretching out behind you while enjoying fresh coastal-inspired cuisine. Palm Springs offers dramatic desert venues with mountain backdrops and striking midcentury modern architecture that photographs beautifully.

### How Much Do Wedding Venues in California Cost?

Wedding venues in California typically run between $9,600 and $11,700 which aligns nicely with the national range of $6,500-$12,000. This represents about 18% of your total wedding budget. Your overall costs will vary based on guest count:

  * 50 guests: $26,190
  * 100 guests: $43,692
  * 150 guests: $60,141
  * 200 guests: $74,836
  * 250 guests: $89,530

### Which California Venues Are Fully Accessible?

The Griffith House features wheelchair-accessible pathways throughout its Spanish-style grounds including the private ceremony lawn and separate preparation spaces for couples. You might also consider Holman Ranch Sunstone Winery and Villa del Sol d'Oro though you'll want to directly confirm their specific accessibility features when you visit. Accessibility options have improved greatly across California venues in recent years.

### When Should You Book Your California Wedding Venue?

October leads venue inquiries in California with couples typically booking venues about 13 months (400 days) before their wedding date. If you're dreaming of a Northern California wine country wedding during peak season you'll want to book up to 18 months in advance. Southern California venues offer more flexibility especially during winter months when you can still enjoy beautiful weather while potentially securing better rates.

### Where Can You Find Exceptional Culinary Experiences in California?
