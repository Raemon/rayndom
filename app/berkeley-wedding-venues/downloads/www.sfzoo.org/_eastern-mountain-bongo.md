## At the Zoo

Bongos can be found near the Lion House, next to the black rhino habitat.

## Fascinating Facts

  * They are one of the only species of spiral-horned antelope in which both sexes have horns.
  * Bongos have been known to eat burned wood after lightning storms; this behavior is believed to be a means of adding salt and other important minerals to their diet.
  * Bongos will frequently wallow in mud then rub their horns against a tree to polish them.



## Physical Characteristics

Mountain bongos have chestnut brown fur with vertical white stripes along their sides. Their face is quite distinct with a dark muzzle, white stripe between the eyes and white spots on their cheeks. Legs are patterned with patches of chestnut, black and white and a crest of long fur runs along their spine. Males tend to darken in color as they age. The bongo’s impressive horns can grow up to three feet long and when tilted back follow the curvature of their back. These are some of the largest forest dwelling antelope weighing between 530-650 pounds. Bongos have large ears that attribute to their strong sense of hearing and a prehensile tongue to grasp the vegetation they feed on.

Lifespan in the wild is unknown, and about 20 years under human care.

## Habitat/Diet

They are found in very fragmented areas in the highlands of Kenya including the Aberdares forests, Mount Kenya, and the Mau and Eburu forests. Bongos inhabit lowland forests as well as tropical jungles with dense undergrowth, up to an altitude of 12,800 feet.

Bongos eat a variety of leaves, shoots, grasses, vines, bark, roots and fruits.

## Social Behavior

Bongos are very shy animals that are mostly active at dawn and dusk. They are seldom seen in large groups; one dominant male and several females with young are typical with family groups not usually exceeding 20 individuals. When males mature they leave their maternal groups and remain solitary, sometimes living in small bachelor groups. They are not territorial and do not have a scent gland for marking like other antelope species. Occasionally males meet and spar with their horns in a ritualized manner. Serious fights are discouraged through visual displays in which both males bulge their necks, roll their eyes and hold their horns in a vertical position while slowly pacing back and forth.

Bongos have a wide range of vocalizations including grunts, snorts, mooing, and a bleat-like alarm call. When they are startled, they will disappear quickly into the forest, keeping their horns against their back.

Females give birth to a single calf after a 9 – 9 ½ month gestational period. Calves are left alone in dense vegetation for about a short period of time with the mother visiting periodically to nurse. This behavior allows the calf to remain hidden from predators while it is most vulnerable. Calves grow quickly and join the herd after about a week and are weaned at about 6 months.

## Status In The Wild

Eastern mountain bongos are listed as critically endangered by the IUCN. A 2007 census concluded that there are only about 47-140 left in the wild. Their population’s rapid decline is due to habitat loss, illegal logging and poaching.

With mountain bongo populations decreasing, eighteen bongos from U.S. zoos were sent to the Mt. Kenya Wildlife Conservancy in 2004. These animals were used to establish a breeding herd for the possible release of future generation into the wild.

San Francisco Zoo & Gardens participates in the AZA Bongo Species Survival Plan and welcomed a birth of a female calf in October 2014.

**What can you do to help Eastern mountain bongos?**

  * Consider supporting conservation organizations, like the International Bongo Foundation, working to save this incredible species and its habitat.
  * Spread the word about bongo conservation!

San Francisco Zoo & Gardens Accessibility Statement

## Accessibility Statement

### Compliance status:

We strongly believe in the importance of making the Internet available and accessible to everyone. Therefore, we are dedicated to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of their circumstances or abilities.

To achieve this goal, we strive to adhere closely to the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1) at the AA level. These guidelines provide instructions on how to make web content accessible to people with various disabilities. By following these guidelines, we ensure that our website is accessible to individuals with visual impairments, motor impairments, cognitive disabilities, and more.

Our website incorporates technologies that enhance accessibility at all times. We utilize an accessibility interface that allows users with specific disabilities to customize the website's user interface (UI) according to their needs.

Additionally, our website employs an AI-based application that continuously optimizes its accessibility level. This application enhances the website's HTML and adjusts its functionality and behavior for screen-reader users and individuals with motor impairments.

If you come across any malfunctions or have suggestions for improvement, we welcome your feedback. Please contact the website's operators at the following email address: [contactEmail].

#### Screen reader and keyboard navigation:

Our website has implemented the ARIA attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) technique and other behavioral modifications to ensure that visitors using screen readers can effectively read, understand, and interact with the website. Upon entering the site, screen reader users are prompted to enter the Screen-Reader Profile, enabling them to browse and navigate the website seamlessly. Here are some important ways our website addresses screen reader requirements:

#### Screen-reader optimization:

We employ a background process that comprehensively learns the website's components, ensuring ongoing compliance even during updates. This process provides screen readers with meaningful data using ARIA attributes. For instance, we provide accurate form labels, descriptions for actionable icons (e.g., social media icons, search icons, cart icons), validation guidance for form inputs, and proper roles for elements like buttons, menus, and modal dialogues. Additionally, the background process scans all website images, generating accurate and meaningful descriptions using image-object-recognition-based ALT tags. It also extracts embedded text within images using optical character recognition (OCR) technology. Users can activate screen reader adjustments at any time by pressing the Alt+1 keyboard combination. Upon entering the website, screen reader users receive automatic announcements to enable the Screen-Reader mode.

#### Keyboard navigation optimization:

The background process enhances the website's HTML and adds JavaScript code to enable keyboard operability. This includes features such as navigating the website using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys, operating dropdown menus with arrow keys, closing them with Esc, triggering buttons and links using the Enter key, navigating between radio buttons and checkboxes with arrow keys, and filling them in with the Spacebar or Enter key. Keyboard users can access quick navigation and content-skip menus at any time by pressing Alt+1 or by finding them as the first elements while navigating using the keyboard. The background process also handles triggered popups by focusing the keyboard on them when they appear, preventing the focus from drifting outside.

Our adjustments are compatible with popular screen readers like JAWS and NVDA.

### Disability profiles supported on our website:

Our website provides various disability profiles to support individuals with specific accessibility needs:

  * Epilepsy Safe Mode: This profile eliminates the risk of seizures caused by flashing or blinking animations and risky color combinations.
  * Visually Impaired Mode: This mode adjusts the website to accommodate users with visual impairments such as Degrading Eyesight, Tunnel Vision, Cataracts, Glaucoma, and others.
  * Cognitive Disability Mode: This mode offers assistive options for users with cognitive impairments such as Dyslexia, Autism, CVA, and others, helping them focus on essential website elements.
  * ADHD-Friendly Mode: This mode assists users with ADHD and Neurodevelopmental disorders in reading, browsing, and maintaining focus on the main website elements while reducing distractions.
  * Blindness Mode: This mode ensures compatibility with screen readers such as JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and TalkBack, which are essential software for blind users.
  * Keyboard Navigation Profile (Motor-Impaired): This profile enables individuals with motor impairments to navigate the website using keyboard keys like Tab, Shift+Tab, and Enter. Users can also utilize shortcuts like "M" for menus, "H" for headings, "F" for forms, "B" for buttons, and "G" for graphics to jump to specific elements.



###   
Additional UI, design, and readability adjustments:

We offer several UI, design, and readability adjustments to enhance the user experience for all visitors:

  * Font adjustments: Users can modify the font size, family (type), spacing, alignment, line height, and more.
  * Color adjustments: Users can select different color contrast profiles (light, dark, inverted, monochrome) and swap color schemes for titles, texts, and backgrounds using over seven different coloring options.
  * Animations: Epileptic users can stop all animations, including videos, GIFs, and CSS flashing transitions, with a single click.
  * Content highlighting: Users can emphasize important elements such as links and titles or choose to highlight only focused or hovered elements.
  * Audio muting: Users with hearing devices can instantly mute the entire website to avoid headaches or other issues caused by automatic audio playback.
  * Cognitive disorders: We utilize a search engine linked to Wikipedia and Wiktionary, allowing users with cognitive disorders to decipher the meanings of phrases, initials, slang, and other content.
  * Additional functions: We provide users with options to change cursor color and size, activate a printing mode, enable a virtual keyboard, and access many other features.



###   
Browser and assistive technology compatibility:

We strive to support a wide range of browsers and assistive technologies, allowing users to choose the tools that best suit their needs. Our website has been extensively tested and works well on major systems, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera, and Microsoft Edge. We ensure compatibility with screen readers like JAWS and NVDA, both for Windows and MAC users.
