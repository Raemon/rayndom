## Fascinating Facts

  * The snow leopard, also known as a rock leopard, is the only exclusively alpine cat in the world.
  * This rare and shy animal is seldom seen and was photographed in the wild for the first time in 1971.
  * A snow leopard’s tail can grow long as the cat’s body, about two to four feet in length.
  * They do not roar, but they do purr and make grunting sounds.



## Physical Characteristics

Snow leopards are smaller than other large cats; males only growing to 100-155 pounds and females from 60-120 pounds. Despite their small size, they are well adapted to living in a severe mountain habitat. Their fur is long and thick, with wooly undercoat for extra warmth. The fur is soft gray to light brown, and the head and lower limbs are marked with black or brown spots. The body is covered with brown, dark grey or black rosettes ringed in dark brown or black. These markings provide excellent camouflage both in snow and among rocky terrain. The rounded paws have large hairy pads that act as snowshoes and also protect the paws from rocks. The snow leopard uses its long tail for balance and for extra warmth when wrapped around itself. They have an enlarged nasal cavity which helps them warm the cold air as they breathe and retain water.

They have short forelimbs and long hindlimbs, making them agile in steep terrain. Snow leopards are also superb jumpers. When stalking prey, they can easily leap distances of 50 feet and up to 20 feet high.

Lifespan is 10-13 years in the wild and about 20 years in captivity.

## Habitat/Diet

Snow leopards live at high-altitude alpine and sub-alpine mountain ranges of the Himalayas including Nepal, China and Central Asia.

Snow leopards are carnivores. In the wild, they eat a variety of mammals and birds including: ibex, blue sheep, musk ox, hares, marmot, ptarmigan, and pheasant. At the Zoo, the cats are fed a diet of fortified horse meat. This muscular, well-built cat can bring down prey more than three times its size.

## Social Behavior

Snow leopards are nocturnal and solitary, but not unsociable. During breeding season they have occasionally been seen hunting in pairs. Ranges often overlap so scent marking with urine and by rubbing along rocks is used to communicate with other snow leopards in the area.

Breeding season is from January to mid-March so that births can occur in the spring, about 95-105 days later. Females give birth in a well-concealed den which is lined with her fur. The typical litter is three cubs or less, and the spots on the cubs are black. Cubs open their eyes after about a week and they become very active by two months. Young stay with their mothers for around two years; afterward they seek out their own territories. Since cubs are dependent on females for so long, breeding only occurs every 2 – 3 years.

## Status In The Wild

Snow leopards are listed as endangered by IUCN and on Appendix I of the CITES. A recent census estimated that there are 4,500 – 7,000 left in the wild. It is difficult to determine their exact number as they are so elusive and blend in with their environment. Illegal poaching is a major threat to their population. Snow leopards are killed for their fur and for bones which are used in traditional medicines. Other threats include loss of prey and human conflict, as snow leopards sometimes prey on domestic livestock and are killed by herders in retaliation.

The San Francisco Zoo is partnered with the Snow Leopard Conservancy, an organization that works in seven snow leopard range countries to address human-animal conflicts and empower local communities to protect this incredible species. The zoo has also had a very successful breeding history of snow leopards, producing 30 snow leopards since 1969.

**What can you do to help snow leopards?**

  * Don’t support illegal trade by purchasing anything made from snow leopards.
  * Support conservation efforts of organizations like the Snow Leopard Conservancy, Snow Leopard Trust, World Wildlife Fund, and AZA-accredited zoos.
  * Spread the word about snow leopard conservation!

San Francisco Zoo & Gardens Accessibility Statement

## Accessibility Statement

### Compliance status:

We strongly believe in the importance of making the Internet available and accessible to everyone. Therefore, we are dedicated to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of their circumstances or abilities.

To achieve this goal, we strive to adhere closely to the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1) at the AA level. These guidelines provide instructions on how to make web content accessible to people with various disabilities. By following these guidelines, we ensure that our website is accessible to individuals with visual impairments, motor impairments, cognitive disabilities, and more.

Our website incorporates technologies that enhance accessibility at all times. We utilize an accessibility interface that allows users with specific disabilities to customize the website's user interface (UI) according to their needs.

Additionally, our website employs an AI-based application that continuously optimizes its accessibility level. This application enhances the website's HTML and adjusts its functionality and behavior for screen-reader users and individuals with motor impairments.

If you come across any malfunctions or have suggestions for improvement, we welcome your feedback. Please contact the website's operators at the following email address: [contactEmail].

#### Screen reader and keyboard navigation:

Our website has implemented the ARIA attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) technique and other behavioral modifications to ensure that visitors using screen readers can effectively read, understand, and interact with the website. Upon entering the site, screen reader users are prompted to enter the Screen-Reader Profile, enabling them to browse and navigate the website seamlessly. Here are some important ways our website addresses screen reader requirements:

#### Screen-reader optimization:

We employ a background process that comprehensively learns the website's components, ensuring ongoing compliance even during updates. This process provides screen readers with meaningful data using ARIA attributes. For instance, we provide accurate form labels, descriptions for actionable icons (e.g., social media icons, search icons, cart icons), validation guidance for form inputs, and proper roles for elements like buttons, menus, and modal dialogues. Additionally, the background process scans all website images, generating accurate and meaningful descriptions using image-object-recognition-based ALT tags. It also extracts embedded text within images using optical character recognition (OCR) technology. Users can activate screen reader adjustments at any time by pressing the Alt+1 keyboard combination. Upon entering the website, screen reader users receive automatic announcements to enable the Screen-Reader mode.

#### Keyboard navigation optimization:

The background process enhances the website's HTML and adds JavaScript code to enable keyboard operability. This includes features such as navigating the website using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys, operating dropdown menus with arrow keys, closing them with Esc, triggering buttons and links using the Enter key, navigating between radio buttons and checkboxes with arrow keys, and filling them in with the Spacebar or Enter key. Keyboard users can access quick navigation and content-skip menus at any time by pressing Alt+1 or by finding them as the first elements while navigating using the keyboard. The background process also handles triggered popups by focusing the keyboard on them when they appear, preventing the focus from drifting outside.

Our adjustments are compatible with popular screen readers like JAWS and NVDA.

### Disability profiles supported on our website:

Our website provides various disability profiles to support individuals with specific accessibility needs:

  * Epilepsy Safe Mode: This profile eliminates the risk of seizures caused by flashing or blinking animations and risky color combinations.
  * Visually Impaired Mode: This mode adjusts the website to accommodate users with visual impairments such as Degrading Eyesight, Tunnel Vision, Cataracts, Glaucoma, and others.
  * Cognitive Disability Mode: This mode offers assistive options for users with cognitive impairments such as Dyslexia, Autism, CVA, and others, helping them focus on essential website elements.
  * ADHD-Friendly Mode: This mode assists users with ADHD and Neurodevelopmental disorders in reading, browsing, and maintaining focus on the main website elements while reducing distractions.
  * Blindness Mode: This mode ensures compatibility with screen readers such as JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and TalkBack, which are essential software for blind users.
  * Keyboard Navigation Profile (Motor-Impaired): This profile enables individuals with motor impairments to navigate the website using keyboard keys like Tab, Shift+Tab, and Enter. Users can also utilize shortcuts like "M" for menus, "H" for headings, "F" for forms, "B" for buttons, and "G" for graphics to jump to specific elements.



###   
Additional UI, design, and readability adjustments:

We offer several UI, design, and readability adjustments to enhance the user experience for all visitors:

  * Font adjustments: Users can modify the font size, family (type), spacing, alignment, line height, and more.
  * Color adjustments: Users can select different color contrast profiles (light, dark, inverted, monochrome) and swap color schemes for titles, texts, and backgrounds using over seven different coloring options.
  * Animations: Epileptic users can stop all animations, including videos, GIFs, and CSS flashing transitions, with a single click.
  * Content highlighting: Users can emphasize important elements such as links and titles or choose to highlight only focused or hovered elements.
  * Audio muting: Users with hearing devices can instantly mute the entire website to avoid headaches or other issues caused by automatic audio playback.
  * Cognitive disorders: We utilize a search engine linked to Wikipedia and Wiktionary, allowing users with cognitive disorders to decipher the meanings of phrases, initials, slang, and other content.
  * Additional functions: We provide users with options to change cursor color and size, activate a printing mode, enable a virtual keyboard, and access many other features.



###   
Browser and assistive technology compatibility:

We strive to support a wide range of browsers and assistive technologies, allowing users to choose the tools that best suit their needs. Our website has been extensively tested and works well on major systems, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera, and Microsoft Edge. We ensure compatibility with screen readers like JAWS and NVDA, both for Windows and MAC users.

### Notes, comments, and feedback:
