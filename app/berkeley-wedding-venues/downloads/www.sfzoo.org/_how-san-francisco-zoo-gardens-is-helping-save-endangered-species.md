# How San Francisco Zoo & Gardens Is Helping Save Endangered Species

Nov 14, 2023

![Endangered Species](https://www.sfzoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/przewalskis-horse-1080x675.jpeg)

In a world where the delicate balance of nature is constantly under threat, the goal of wildlife conservation has never been more critical. Across the globe, countless species face the risk of extinction due to habitat loss, poaching, and the depletion of natural resources. San Francisco Zoo & Gardens, located in the heart of the city, is [playing a vital role in protecting and preserving these magnificent creatures and their habitats](/animal-adoption-programs&utm_source=blog&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=Save-Endangered-Species). In this blog, we will explore how San Francisco Zoo is contributing to the conservation efforts, focusing on some of the world’s most endangered animals and the importance of this work.

##   
**San Francisco Zoo: A Haven for Conservation**

The San Francisco Zoo stands as a beacon of hope and a vital contributor to global conservation initiatives. [Far from being just a typical wildlife park](/the-ultimate-guide-to-a-family-friendly-day-at-san-francisco-zoo-gardens&utm_source=blog&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=Save-Endangered-Species), it plays a multifaceted role in the preservation of our planet’s precious biodiversity. At its core, the zoo is a hub of conservation efforts, serving as a living testament to its commitment to the well-being of both captive and wild animals.

The zoo’s dedication to conservation is evident through its extensive partnerships with organizations on a global scale. By collaborating with like-minded institutions and conservation groups around the world, San Francisco Zoo demonstrates its dedication to safeguarding wildlife and their natural habitats. These partnerships go beyond geographical boundaries, symbolizing the zoo’s recognition that conservation is a shared responsibility that transcends borders.

### **The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species**

[The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species](https://www.iucnredlist.org/) is a comprehensive catalog of the world’s most endangered animals. It categorizes species into different levels of threat, ranging from vulnerable to critically endangered. The list serves as a global benchmark for assessing the conservation status of species.

###   
**The Most Endangered Animals**

### **Black Rhinos**

[Black rhinos are on the brink of extinction, with poaching being a significant threat.](/black-rhinoceros/?utm_source=blog+post&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=How+SF+Zoo+Is+Helping+Save+Endangered+Species) San Francisco Zoo is part of a coordinated effort to save these magnificent creatures and educate the public about the critical importance of their conservation.

### **Snow Leopard**

[Snow leopards are listed as endangered by IUCN](/snow-leopard/?utm_source=blog+post&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=How+SF+Zoo+Is+Helping+Save+Endangered+Species) and on Appendix I of the CITES. A recent census estimated that there are 4,500 – 7,000 left in the wild. It is hard to determine their exact number as they are so elusive and blend in with their environment. 

The San Francisco Zoo has formed a partnership with the [Snow Leopard Conservancy](https://snowleopardconservancy.org/), an organization dedicated to addressing human-animal conflicts and empowering local communities in seven snow leopard range countries to safeguard this remarkable species. Additionally, the zoo boasts a noteworthy track record of successful snow leopard breeding, having welcomed 30 new snow leopards into the world since 1969.

### **Przewalski’s Horses**

In the realm of wildlife conservation, few tales are as inspiring as the resurgence of Przewalski’s horse, a species that was once on the brink of extinction. Imagine a creature declared extinct in the wild 54 years ago, only to defy the odds and make a triumphant return. This extraordinary journey is a testament to the dedication of accredited zoos and global organizations that rallied together for the survival of the last truly wild horse. The Przewalski’s horse, also known as “takhi” in Mongolian, meaning spirit, has never been domesticated, adding to its mystique. 

The San Francisco Zoo is now a part of this incredible narrative, as they proudly introduced a pair of Przewalski’s horses—a 17-year-old and a 22-year-old—who recently made their way from the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago. These magnificent creatures will be cherished residents of the Asian conservation zone, offering visitors a rare glimpse into the captivating world of the Mongolian wild horse. As we welcome these two females, we invite you to witness the living embodiment of a species that has defied extinction and is now thriving under the care of dedicated conservationists. 

#### **Conservation in Action**

San Francisco Zoo & Gardens is home to a range of endangered, exotic, and rescued animal species. [Over the past few years, the zoo has undergone a philosophical transformation – now focusing on the importance of ecological biodiversity, and how human behavior has threatened many once-thriving regions around the world.](/sf-zoo-by-the-numbers/?utm_source=blog+post&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=How+SF+Zoo+Is+Helping+Save+Endangered+Species) While the zoo’s mission has always been wildlife conservation, the emphasis now is to create a space and dialogue for guests to better understand why so many of the world’s species are endangered or in danger of becoming extinct.

##   
**The Importance of Wildlife Conservation**

The importance of wildlife conservation cannot be overstated. It not only preserves the world’s incredible biodiversity but also maintains the ecological balance necessary for the survival of many other species, including humans. The interdependence of all living organisms means that the loss of any one species can have far-reaching consequences.

San Francisco Zoo & Gardens is a shining example of a place where the goal of wildlife conservation is not just a motto but a way of life. By actively participating in conservation efforts to protect some of the world’s most endangered animals, San Francisco Zoo is contributing to the preservation of our natural world and the ecosystems upon which we all rely. As we collectively strive to safeguard our planet’s remarkable biodiversity, let us remember that the future of these remarkable creatures depends on the actions we take today.

San Francisco Zoo & Gardens Accessibility Statement

## Accessibility Statement

### Compliance status:

We strongly believe in the importance of making the Internet available and accessible to everyone. Therefore, we are dedicated to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of their circumstances or abilities.

To achieve this goal, we strive to adhere closely to the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1) at the AA level. These guidelines provide instructions on how to make web content accessible to people with various disabilities. By following these guidelines, we ensure that our website is accessible to individuals with visual impairments, motor impairments, cognitive disabilities, and more.

Our website incorporates technologies that enhance accessibility at all times. We utilize an accessibility interface that allows users with specific disabilities to customize the website's user interface (UI) according to their needs.

Additionally, our website employs an AI-based application that continuously optimizes its accessibility level. This application enhances the website's HTML and adjusts its functionality and behavior for screen-reader users and individuals with motor impairments.

If you come across any malfunctions or have suggestions for improvement, we welcome your feedback. Please contact the website's operators at the following email address: [contactEmail].

#### Screen reader and keyboard navigation:

Our website has implemented the ARIA attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) technique and other behavioral modifications to ensure that visitors using screen readers can effectively read, understand, and interact with the website. Upon entering the site, screen reader users are prompted to enter the Screen-Reader Profile, enabling them to browse and navigate the website seamlessly. Here are some important ways our website addresses screen reader requirements:

#### Screen-reader optimization:

We employ a background process that comprehensively learns the website's components, ensuring ongoing compliance even during updates. This process provides screen readers with meaningful data using ARIA attributes. For instance, we provide accurate form labels, descriptions for actionable icons (e.g., social media icons, search icons, cart icons), validation guidance for form inputs, and proper roles for elements like buttons, menus, and modal dialogues. Additionally, the background process scans all website images, generating accurate and meaningful descriptions using image-object-recognition-based ALT tags. It also extracts embedded text within images using optical character recognition (OCR) technology. Users can activate screen reader adjustments at any time by pressing the Alt+1 keyboard combination. Upon entering the website, screen reader users receive automatic announcements to enable the Screen-Reader mode.

#### Keyboard navigation optimization:

The background process enhances the website's HTML and adds JavaScript code to enable keyboard operability. This includes features such as navigating the website using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys, operating dropdown menus with arrow keys, closing them with Esc, triggering buttons and links using the Enter key, navigating between radio buttons and checkboxes with arrow keys, and filling them in with the Spacebar or Enter key. Keyboard users can access quick navigation and content-skip menus at any time by pressing Alt+1 or by finding them as the first elements while navigating using the keyboard. The background process also handles triggered popups by focusing the keyboard on them when they appear, preventing the focus from drifting outside.

Our adjustments are compatible with popular screen readers like JAWS and NVDA.

### Disability profiles supported on our website:

Our website provides various disability profiles to support individuals with specific accessibility needs:

  * Epilepsy Safe Mode: This profile eliminates the risk of seizures caused by flashing or blinking animations and risky color combinations.
  * Visually Impaired Mode: This mode adjusts the website to accommodate users with visual impairments such as Degrading Eyesight, Tunnel Vision, Cataracts, Glaucoma, and others.
  * Cognitive Disability Mode: This mode offers assistive options for users with cognitive impairments such as Dyslexia, Autism, CVA, and others, helping them focus on essential website elements.
  * ADHD-Friendly Mode: This mode assists users with ADHD and Neurodevelopmental disorders in reading, browsing, and maintaining focus on the main website elements while reducing distractions.
  * Blindness Mode: This mode ensures compatibility with screen readers such as JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and TalkBack, which are essential software for blind users.
  * Keyboard Navigation Profile (Motor-Impaired): This profile enables individuals with motor impairments to navigate the website using keyboard keys like Tab, Shift+Tab, and Enter. Users can also utilize shortcuts like "M" for menus, "H" for headings, "F" for forms, "B" for buttons, and "G" for graphics to jump to specific elements.



###   
Additional UI, design, and readability adjustments:

We offer several UI, design, and readability adjustments to enhance the user experience for all visitors:

  * Font adjustments: Users can modify the font size, family (type), spacing, alignment, line height, and more.
  * Color adjustments: Users can select different color contrast profiles (light, dark, inverted, monochrome) and swap color schemes for titles, texts, and backgrounds using over seven different coloring options.
  * Animations: Epileptic users can stop all animations, including videos, GIFs, and CSS flashing transitions, with a single click.
  * Content highlighting: Users can emphasize important elements such as links and titles or choose to highlight only focused or hovered elements.
  * Audio muting: Users with hearing devices can instantly mute the entire website to avoid headaches or other issues caused by automatic audio playback.
  * Cognitive disorders: We utilize a search engine linked to Wikipedia and Wiktionary, allowing users with cognitive disorders to decipher the meanings of phrases, initials, slang, and other content.
  * Additional functions: We provide users with options to change cursor color and size, activate a printing mode, enable a virtual keyboard, and access many other features.



###   
Browser and assistive technology compatibility:

We strive to support a wide range of browsers and assistive technologies, allowing users to choose the tools that best suit their needs. Our website has been extensively tested and works well on major systems, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera, and Microsoft Edge. We ensure compatibility with screen readers like JAWS and NVDA, both for Windows and MAC users.

### Notes, comments, and feedback:

While we have made significant efforts to make our website accessible to everyone, there may still be pages or sections that are not fully accessible or lack adequate technological solutions. We are continuously improving our accessibility features, incorporating new technologies, and working towards achieving the optimal level of accessibility. If you require assistance or have any feedback, please contact us at [contactEmail].
