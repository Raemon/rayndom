## At the Zoo

Our golden eagle resides in the Koret Animal Resource Center.

## Fascinating Facts

  * The highest density of nesting golden eagles in the world lies in southern Alameda County, California.
  * Golden eagles can carry prey up to 8 pounds and dive at 200 miles per hour.
  * Eagle pairs add to their nest every year so that some grow to a massive size; the largest was six feet wide.
  * The Golden eagle is the national bird of Mexico.
  * Golden eagles are often mistaken for juvenile bald eagles, as their coloration and size are very similar.
  * They typically soar with wings lifted into a slight “V” and the wingtip feathers spread like fingers.



## Physical Characteristics

The golden eagle is the largest bird of prey in North America. They have a long, broad wingspan of up to 7 feet and weigh between 6-15 pounds. Females, like with other raptors, are larger and heavier than males.

Adult birds are primarily brown, with golden brown on the back of the crown and neck, and some grey on the wings and tail. Coloration tends to fade over time with sun exposure. The bill is dark at the tip, fading to a lighter color, with a yellow base. Legs are feathered and large talons are yellow.

Juveniles are darker in color, with white patches in the flight feathers which may be divided by darker feathers, and a large amount of white on the tail with a black band at the tip.

Lifespan is about 30 years in the wild, and up to 46 under human care.

## Habitat/Diet

Golden eagles are one of the most widespread birds of prey. They are found across Eurasia, northern Africa, and western North America in a variety of habitats. They tend to prefer open habitat in mountainous areas, as well as tundra, grasslands, woodlands and along bodies of water. Most do not migrate seasonally; this is only true for birds living in the northern part of their range.

They prey mostly on small and medium rodents but will also eat reptiles, fish, other birds, carrion and even young deer and foxes. At the zoo, our golden eagle eats a diet of rat, herring, mice and rabbit.

## Social Behavior

Golden eagles are usually found alone or in pairs, but may form small groups of juveniles or around large sources of food. Pairs of golden eagles have been observed hunting cooperatively; where one bird chases prey and the other swoops in to catch it. They are monogamous and may mate for life.

Breeding season varies throughout its range but typically occurs between March and August. Courtship includes acrobatic flight in which both birds circle, dive and tumble through the air. Both male and female help build the nest in a tree, cliff ledge or occasionally on man-made structures. Nests are made from sticks to create a large platform and lined with grasses, leaves and moss. A clutch of one to four, but usually only two, white and brown speckled eggs are laid in three day intervals. Eggs are incubated for about 40-45 days; in the meantime the male brings food to the female who does most of the brooding. A few weeks after chicks hatch the female takes over finding food for chicks. Young golden eagles are able to fly around 60-70 days but are not independent for another 32-80 days.

Golden eagles are generally quiet birds; although, during breeding and brooding season they have been known to make up to nine unique sounds.

## Status In The Wild

Golden eagles are listed as least concern by the IUCN. Like the bald eagle, their population drastically declined in the early part of the 20th century due to human-caused disturbance and conflict. Golden eagles were intentionally poisoned and shot by farmers who believed that eagles preyed upon domesticated livestock. Today, the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act prohibit the hunting or sale of eagles or eagle parts. Due to increased protection and banning of pesticides like DDT their populations are stable throughout much of their range. Threats still include poisoning due to lead ammunition, prey loss and collision with vehicles and wind turbines.

San Francisco Zoo & Gardens Accessibility Statement

## Accessibility Statement

### Compliance status:

We strongly believe in the importance of making the Internet available and accessible to everyone. Therefore, we are dedicated to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of their circumstances or abilities.

To achieve this goal, we strive to adhere closely to the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1) at the AA level. These guidelines provide instructions on how to make web content accessible to people with various disabilities. By following these guidelines, we ensure that our website is accessible to individuals with visual impairments, motor impairments, cognitive disabilities, and more.

Our website incorporates technologies that enhance accessibility at all times. We utilize an accessibility interface that allows users with specific disabilities to customize the website's user interface (UI) according to their needs.

Additionally, our website employs an AI-based application that continuously optimizes its accessibility level. This application enhances the website's HTML and adjusts its functionality and behavior for screen-reader users and individuals with motor impairments.

If you come across any malfunctions or have suggestions for improvement, we welcome your feedback. Please contact the website's operators at the following email address: [contactEmail].

#### Screen reader and keyboard navigation:

Our website has implemented the ARIA attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) technique and other behavioral modifications to ensure that visitors using screen readers can effectively read, understand, and interact with the website. Upon entering the site, screen reader users are prompted to enter the Screen-Reader Profile, enabling them to browse and navigate the website seamlessly. Here are some important ways our website addresses screen reader requirements:

#### Screen-reader optimization:

We employ a background process that comprehensively learns the website's components, ensuring ongoing compliance even during updates. This process provides screen readers with meaningful data using ARIA attributes. For instance, we provide accurate form labels, descriptions for actionable icons (e.g., social media icons, search icons, cart icons), validation guidance for form inputs, and proper roles for elements like buttons, menus, and modal dialogues. Additionally, the background process scans all website images, generating accurate and meaningful descriptions using image-object-recognition-based ALT tags. It also extracts embedded text within images using optical character recognition (OCR) technology. Users can activate screen reader adjustments at any time by pressing the Alt+1 keyboard combination. Upon entering the website, screen reader users receive automatic announcements to enable the Screen-Reader mode.

#### Keyboard navigation optimization:

The background process enhances the website's HTML and adds JavaScript code to enable keyboard operability. This includes features such as navigating the website using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys, operating dropdown menus with arrow keys, closing them with Esc, triggering buttons and links using the Enter key, navigating between radio buttons and checkboxes with arrow keys, and filling them in with the Spacebar or Enter key. Keyboard users can access quick navigation and content-skip menus at any time by pressing Alt+1 or by finding them as the first elements while navigating using the keyboard. The background process also handles triggered popups by focusing the keyboard on them when they appear, preventing the focus from drifting outside.

Our adjustments are compatible with popular screen readers like JAWS and NVDA.

  * Animations: Epileptic users can stop all animations, including videos, GIFs, and CSS flashing transitions, with a single click.
  * Content highlighting: Users can emphasize important elements such as links and titles or choose to highlight only focused or hovered elements.
  * Audio muting: Users with hearing devices can instantly mute the entire website to avoid headaches or other issues caused by automatic audio playback.
  * Cognitive disorders: We utilize a search engine linked to Wikipedia and Wiktionary, allowing users with cognitive disorders to decipher the meanings of phrases, initials, slang, and other content.
  * Additional functions: We provide users with options to change cursor color and size, activate a printing mode, enable a virtual keyboard, and access many other features.



###   
Browser and assistive technology compatibility:

We strive to support a wide range of browsers and assistive technologies, allowing users to choose the tools that best suit their needs. Our website has been extensively tested and works well on major systems, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera, and Microsoft Edge.
