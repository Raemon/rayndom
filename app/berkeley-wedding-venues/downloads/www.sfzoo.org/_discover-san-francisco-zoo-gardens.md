# Bloom & Roar: Discover the Gardens at San Francisco Zoo & Gardens 🦁

Apr 18, 2025

When you think of the San Francisco Zoo & Gardens, you might picture majestic lions, playful penguins, or towering giraffes. But did you know that our 100-acre urban oasis is also blooming with beautiful gardens? Nestled along the Pacific Coast, our zoo offers a botanical journey that delights visitors of all ages—adding a splash of color, scent, and serenity to your wild day out.

## **🌼 A Garden for Every Explorer**

Our gardens are as diverse and vibrant as the animals they surround. Thanks to San Francisco’s mild climate, we’re able to cultivate a wide array of plants from across the globe—from native wildflowers to prehistoric ferns. Whether you’re a plant enthusiast, budding botanist, or just love to stop and smell the roses, there’s a garden here for you:

  * **Native California Gardens****  
**Located near the Connie and Bob Lurie Education Center, Greenie’s Conservation Corner, and across from the Lion Fountain, these gardens showcase native plants like California poppies, yarrow, and ceanothus. These beauties are built to thrive in our climate and require minimal water—perfect examples of sustainable gardening in action.  

  * **Dune Garden****  
**Nestled along the Great Highway edge of the zoo, this coastal garden highlights plants that naturally thrive in sandy soils and salty air. It’s a quiet, windswept spot with fascinating native flora that calls the California coast home.  

  * **African Plant Displays****  
**Surrounding the Leanne B. Roberts African Savanna and Osher Giraffe Lodge, you’ll find stunning African flora including several dazzling protea species. These bold blooms add a vibrant, global flair to your walk among zebras and giraffes.  

  * **Prehistoric Garden****  
**Located near the lake and across from the South American Tropical Building, this time-traveling garden features ancient plant varieties like gunnera, horsetails, mosses, and ferns—plants that date back to the age of dinosaurs!  

  * **Gardens of the Fisher Family Children’s Zoo****  
**Families love exploring this playful garden zone featuring:
    * A **Butterfly Garden** with pollinator-friendly blooms,
    * The whimsical **Fried-Egg Poppy** garden (yes, it looks just like its name!),
    * And a charming **Rose Garden** full of sweet scents and delicate colors. It’s a magical place for little explorers to learn how flowers support wildlife—and maybe even spot a butterfly or two!



## **🌿 Greenie’s Conservation Corner: Sustainability in Bloom**

Opened on Earth Day in 2010, Greenie’s Conservation Corner is a showcase of eco-friendly gardening and creative reuse. Once an unused animal exhibit, it now thrives with edible herbs and vegetables planted in repurposed containers like old garbage cans and fencing.

Here, you’ll discover:

  * Drought-tolerant plants and pollinator favorites,
  * A solar-powered fountain made from former animal troughs,
  * Seasonal veggies like carrots, kale, and chard harvested for our animal residents,
  * Rainwater harvesting, composting, wind and solar energy displays,
  * And even a working beehive!



While you stroll the garden path, don’t miss the authentic 1906 earthquake shack—offering a peek into San Francisco’s resilient history and a great conversation starter on sustainability and innovation.

**🌸 Why Gardens Matter**

Our gardens are more than just a pretty sight—they’re a vital part of our mission. They support animal habitats, serve as outdoor classrooms, and inspire our guests to make eco-friendly choices at home. From showing kids how flowers feed butterflies to growing organic food for our animals, each garden helps tell the bigger story of conservation.

### **🌺 Plan Your Visit**

Whether you’re snapping photos of blooming roses or learning how to start your own pollinator patch, the gardens at the San Francisco Zoo & Gardens are not to be missed. We’re open daily from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., with the last entry at 4:00 p.m.

🌿 Come for the animals, stay for the gardens, and leave inspired by the natural beauty that connects us all. Thank you to our major donors, Gail Secchia as well as Robert and Regina Muehlhauser, for making these beautiful gardens possible.

San Francisco Zoo & Gardens Accessibility Statement

## Accessibility Statement

### Compliance status:

We strongly believe in the importance of making the Internet available and accessible to everyone. Therefore, we are dedicated to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of their circumstances or abilities.

To achieve this goal, we strive to adhere closely to the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1) at the AA level. These guidelines provide instructions on how to make web content accessible to people with various disabilities. By following these guidelines, we ensure that our website is accessible to individuals with visual impairments, motor impairments, cognitive disabilities, and more.

Our website incorporates technologies that enhance accessibility at all times. We utilize an accessibility interface that allows users with specific disabilities to customize the website's user interface (UI) according to their needs.

Additionally, our website employs an AI-based application that continuously optimizes its accessibility level. This application enhances the website's HTML and adjusts its functionality and behavior for screen-reader users and individuals with motor impairments.

If you come across any malfunctions or have suggestions for improvement, we welcome your feedback. Please contact the website's operators at the following email address: [contactEmail].

#### Screen reader and keyboard navigation:

Our website has implemented the ARIA attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) technique and other behavioral modifications to ensure that visitors using screen readers can effectively read, understand, and interact with the website. Upon entering the site, screen reader users are prompted to enter the Screen-Reader Profile, enabling them to browse and navigate the website seamlessly. Here are some important ways our website addresses screen reader requirements:

#### Screen-reader optimization:

We employ a background process that comprehensively learns the website's components, ensuring ongoing compliance even during updates. This process provides screen readers with meaningful data using ARIA attributes. For instance, we provide accurate form labels, descriptions for actionable icons (e.g., social media icons, search icons, cart icons), validation guidance for form inputs, and proper roles for elements like buttons, menus, and modal dialogues. Additionally, the background process scans all website images, generating accurate and meaningful descriptions using image-object-recognition-based ALT tags. It also extracts embedded text within images using optical character recognition (OCR) technology. Users can activate screen reader adjustments at any time by pressing the Alt+1 keyboard combination. Upon entering the website, screen reader users receive automatic announcements to enable the Screen-Reader mode.

#### Keyboard navigation optimization:

The background process enhances the website's HTML and adds JavaScript code to enable keyboard operability. This includes features such as navigating the website using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys, operating dropdown menus with arrow keys, closing them with Esc, triggering buttons and links using the Enter key, navigating between radio buttons and checkboxes with arrow keys, and filling them in with the Spacebar or Enter key. Keyboard users can access quick navigation and content-skip menus at any time by pressing Alt+1 or by finding them as the first elements while navigating using the keyboard. The background process also handles triggered popups by focusing the keyboard on them when they appear, preventing the focus from drifting outside.

Our adjustments are compatible with popular screen readers like JAWS and NVDA.

### Disability profiles supported on our website:

Our website provides various disability profiles to support individuals with specific accessibility needs:

  * Epilepsy Safe Mode: This profile eliminates the risk of seizures caused by flashing or blinking animations and risky color combinations.
  * Visually Impaired Mode: This mode adjusts the website to accommodate users with visual impairments such as Degrading Eyesight, Tunnel Vision, Cataracts, Glaucoma, and others.
  * Cognitive Disability Mode: This mode offers assistive options for users with cognitive impairments such as Dyslexia, Autism, CVA, and others, helping them focus on essential website elements.
  * ADHD-Friendly Mode: This mode assists users with ADHD and Neurodevelopmental disorders in reading, browsing, and maintaining focus on the main website elements while reducing distractions.
  * Blindness Mode: This mode ensures compatibility with screen readers such as JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and TalkBack, which are essential software for blind users.
  * Keyboard Navigation Profile (Motor-Impaired): This profile enables individuals with motor impairments to navigate the website using keyboard keys like Tab, Shift+Tab, and Enter. Users can also utilize shortcuts like "M" for menus, "H" for headings, "F" for forms, "B" for buttons, and "G" for graphics to jump to specific elements.



###   
Additional UI, design, and readability adjustments:

We offer several UI, design, and readability adjustments to enhance the user experience for all visitors:

  * Font adjustments: Users can modify the font size, family (type), spacing, alignment, line height, and more.
  * Color adjustments: Users can select different color contrast profiles (light, dark, inverted, monochrome) and swap color schemes for titles, texts, and backgrounds using over seven different coloring options.
  * Animations: Epileptic users can stop all animations, including videos, GIFs, and CSS flashing transitions, with a single click.
  * Content highlighting: Users can emphasize important elements such as links and titles or choose to highlight only focused or hovered elements.
  * Audio muting: Users with hearing devices can instantly mute the entire website to avoid headaches or other issues caused by automatic audio playback.
  * Cognitive disorders: We utilize a search engine linked to Wikipedia and Wiktionary, allowing users with cognitive disorders to decipher the meanings of phrases, initials, slang, and other content.
  * Additional functions: We provide users with options to change cursor color and size, activate a printing mode, enable a virtual keyboard, and access many other features.



###   
Browser and assistive technology compatibility:

We strive to support a wide range of browsers and assistive technologies, allowing users to choose the tools that best suit their needs. Our website has been extensively tested and works well on major systems, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera, and Microsoft Edge. We ensure compatibility with screen readers like JAWS and NVDA, both for Windows and MAC users.

### Notes, comments, and feedback:

While we have made significant efforts to make our website accessible to everyone, there may still be pages or sections that are not fully accessible or lack adequate technological solutions. We are continuously improving our accessibility features, incorporating new technologies, and working towards achieving the optimal level of accessibility. If you require assistance or have any feedback, please contact us at [contactEmail].
