# Historic Sites

More than 60 years after a special place was created at San Francisco Zoo just for children, today’s Children’s Zoo remains a fixture where families can delight in exploration as generations did before them.

## The Children’s Zoo

**Evolution of the Children’s Zoo**  
The Fisher Family Children’s Zoo is one of the most popular areas at the San Francisco Zoo. It has been a source of wonderment and discovery for millions of children, providing them with up-close encounters with animals and a unique place to call their own. Today’s Children’s Zoo has evolved into a special place for both kids and adults, with a wide range of family activities and educational opportunities. The face of the Children’s Zoo has changed significantly since its early days, becoming a unique hands-on learning experience for the entire family.

**Storyland**  
In 1959, the three-acre Storyland debuted as an outdoor playground area featuring life-sized scenes from nursery rhymes and fairy tales with play equipment. Storyland was developed, opened, and operated by the San Francisco Recreation and Park Department. Considered a unique concept in family entertainment, it consisted of 26 animated action and audio sets in two and three dimensions.

Animated fairy tale sets depicted scenes from Old King Cole, Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Humpty Dumpty, Hansel and Gretel, and Old Mother Hubbard. The action sets featured See Saw Marjorie Daw (teeter totter), Jack and Jill (slide), Ring-around a Rosie (merry-go-round), Old Woman in a Shoe (circular ride), Witches’ House (play house), Cinderella (creative play form), School House (play house), Monday’s Child (contour path), Humpty Dumpty (maze), and Pooh Corner (creative play form). Drinking fountains were made in the shape of Babar the Elephant and Town Mouse and Country Mouse. The audio sets included King Cole, Rapunzel’s Castle (entrance motif), Sing a Song of Sixpence, Goldilocks and the Three Bears, and Alice in Wonderland.

The Mad Hatter’s Munch Bar, a themed food stand, provided refreshments visitors could purchase. At the Sugar Plum Party Area, four party courts were arranged in the form of a four leaf clover around a 12-foot high Sugar Plum Tree. These areas could be reserved for children’s parties at a minimal cost. And while admission to the main Zoo was free, Storyland admission was not: children 12 and under were 10¢, and 15¢ for all persons over 12.

**Storyland Children’s Zoo**  
In February 1964, the Zoological Society took over the operation of Storyland from the City’s Recreation and Park Department. In March 1964, the Children Zoo opened as a place “where children of all ages may actually pet, hold and feed baby animals.”

To kick off their new Children’s Zoo concept, the Zoological Society leased Rhue’s famous Baby Zoo located in Thousand Oaks, CA for a period of six months. Rhue’s Baby Zoo was in an enclosed area 120 x 140 feet. Many of the animals roamed around freely and could be handled by visitors. The animals included a baby elephant, pygmy horses, pygmy donkeys, burros, a giant tortoise, bear cubs, lion cubs, deer, llamas, chimpanzees, pygmy goats, kangaroos, sheep, gibbons, macaques, and an assortment of geese, turkeys, rabbits, piglets and lemurs. At the end of six months, a permanent Children’s Zoo was constructed.

The first completed portion of the Children’s Zoo was a redwood corral and shed located inside the tracks of the Little Puffer miniature steam train. The first occupants of the corral were two eight-month-old burros, Rosie and Tootsie. An egg hatchery where visitors could watch eggs hatched in a display incubator followed. Over time, attractions such as a penguin show were added — a 20-minute performance by 12 Humboldt penguins trained to box, ride a surfboard, dive and even play a piano. From time to time, baby animals from the main zoo were cared for in the nursery. Even then, the Children’s Zoo offered a learning and teaching experience with many educational graphics to provide teachers and parents with information to discuss with their kids.

**More Changes**  
Over the years, the Storyland playsets were removed, and animal areas were constructed. A Nature Trail pathway was added to provide visitors with opportunities to meet a variety of animals up-close. The indoor Insect Zoo got its start as a temporary exhibit in 1979, proving so popular that it became a permanent exhibit shortly thereafter. In 1996, Rapunzel’s Castle — the last vestige of Storyland — was demolished and replaced with a new entranceway, which included a trout stream, wetlands interpretive station and a large bronze statue of geese. In 2000, the Meerkat and Prairie Dog exhibit opened, providing close-up viewing of two diverse burrowing mammals with a wide variety of activities, such as crawl-in burrows, for the kids.

**Today**  
The Fisher Family Children’s Zoo, also known as the Exploration Zone, has evolved from its early Storyland days to become an exciting part of the Zoo experience. Here, children are given the means to become involved with animals in a positive way. Presentations such as livestock demonstrations and hatchery care impart important information to youngsters, while hands-on activities such as grooming or feeding the goats help to build unique bonds with animals. Today, visitors can learn about farm life and meet rare breeds of domestic animals in the Family Farm, see birds of prey at the Koret Animal Resource Center, meet youth volunteers and a variety of animals on the Nature Trail during the summer, and visit some of the world’s most unusual creatures in the Insect Zoo.

San Francisco Zoo & Gardens Accessibility Statement

## Accessibility Statement

### Compliance status:

We strongly believe in the importance of making the Internet available and accessible to everyone. Therefore, we are dedicated to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of their circumstances or abilities.

To achieve this goal, we strive to adhere closely to the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1) at the AA level. These guidelines provide instructions on how to make web content accessible to people with various disabilities. By following these guidelines, we ensure that our website is accessible to individuals with visual impairments, motor impairments, cognitive disabilities, and more.

Our website incorporates technologies that enhance accessibility at all times. We utilize an accessibility interface that allows users with specific disabilities to customize the website's user interface (UI) according to their needs.

Additionally, our website employs an AI-based application that continuously optimizes its accessibility level. This application enhances the website's HTML and adjusts its functionality and behavior for screen-reader users and individuals with motor impairments.

If you come across any malfunctions or have suggestions for improvement, we welcome your feedback. Please contact the website's operators at the following email address: [contactEmail].

#### Screen reader and keyboard navigation:

Our website has implemented the ARIA attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) technique and other behavioral modifications to ensure that visitors using screen readers can effectively read, understand, and interact with the website. Upon entering the site, screen reader users are prompted to enter the Screen-Reader Profile, enabling them to browse and navigate the website seamlessly. Here are some important ways our website addresses screen reader requirements:

#### Screen-reader optimization:

We employ a background process that comprehensively learns the website's components, ensuring ongoing compliance even during updates. This process provides screen readers with meaningful data using ARIA attributes. For instance, we provide accurate form labels, descriptions for actionable icons (e.g., social media icons, search icons, cart icons), validation guidance for form inputs, and proper roles for elements like buttons, menus, and modal dialogues. Additionally, the background process scans all website images, generating accurate and meaningful descriptions using image-object-recognition-based ALT tags. It also extracts embedded text within images using optical character recognition (OCR) technology. Users can activate screen reader adjustments at any time by pressing the Alt+1 keyboard combination. Upon entering the website, screen reader users receive automatic announcements to enable the Screen-Reader mode.

#### Keyboard navigation optimization:

The background process enhances the website's HTML and adds JavaScript code to enable keyboard operability. This includes features such as navigating the website using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys, operating dropdown menus with arrow keys, closing them with Esc, triggering buttons and links using the Enter key, navigating between radio buttons and checkboxes with arrow keys, and filling them in with the Spacebar or Enter key. Keyboard users can access quick navigation and content-skip menus at any time by pressing Alt+1 or by finding them as the first elements while navigating using the keyboard. The background process also handles triggered popups by focusing the keyboard on them when they appear, preventing the focus from drifting outside.

Our adjustments are compatible with popular screen readers like JAWS and NVDA.

### Disability profiles supported on our website:

Our website provides various disability profiles to support individuals with specific accessibility needs:

  * Epilepsy Safe Mode: This profile eliminates the risk of seizures caused by flashing or blinking animations and risky color combinations.

  * ADHD-Friendly Mode: This mode assists users with ADHD and Neurodevelopmental disorders in reading, browsing, and maintaining focus on the main website elements while reducing distractions.
  * Blindness Mode: This mode ensures compatibility with screen readers such as JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and TalkBack, which are essential software for blind users.
  * Keyboard Navigation Profile (Motor-Impaired): This profile enables individuals with motor impairments to navigate the website using keyboard keys like Tab, Shift+Tab, and Enter. Users can also utilize shortcuts like "M" for menus, "H" for headings, "F" for forms, "B" for buttons, and "G" for graphics to jump to specific elements.



###   
Additional UI, design, and readability adjustments:

We offer several UI, design, and readability adjustments to enhance the user experience for all visitors:

  * Font adjustments: Users can modify the font size, family (type), spacing, alignment, line height, and more.
  * Color adjustments: Users can select different color contrast profiles (light, dark, inverted, monochrome) and swap color schemes for titles, texts, and backgrounds using over seven different coloring options.
  * Animations: Epileptic users can stop all animations, including videos, GIFs, and CSS flashing transitions, with a single click.
  * Content highlighting: Users can emphasize important elements such as links and titles or choose to highlight only focused or hovered elements.
  * Audio muting: Users with hearing devices can instantly mute the entire website to avoid headaches or other issues caused by automatic audio playback.
  * Cognitive disorders: We utilize a search engine linked to Wikipedia and Wiktionary, allowing users with cognitive disorders to decipher the meanings of phrases, initials, slang, and other content.
  * Additional functions: We provide users with options to change cursor color and size, activate a printing mode, enable a virtual keyboard, and access many other features.



###   
Browser and assistive technology compatibility:

We strive to support a wide range of browsers and assistive technologies, allowing users to choose the tools that best suit their needs. Our website has been extensively tested and works well on major systems, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera, and Microsoft Edge. We ensure compatibility with screen readers like JAWS and NVDA, both for Windows and MAC users.
