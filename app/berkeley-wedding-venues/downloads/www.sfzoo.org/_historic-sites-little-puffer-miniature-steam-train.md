# Historic Sites

A beloved miniature steam train known as Little Puffer is synonymous with San Francisco Zoo’s history, and continues to bring joy to today’s families as it did for generations of zoo-goers.

## Little Puffer Miniature Steam Train

One of San Francisco Zoo & Gardens’ most unique attractions isn’t an animal; it’s a rare miniature steam train known affectionately as “Little Puffer.” And over time, this historical gem has become known as the “little engine that could.”

Called the Fleishhacker Playfield Limited and nicknamed Little Puffer, the train chugged around the Zoo for many years, and eventually relegated into storage for almost 20 years. Its return in 1998 delighted all.

When you see the Little Puffer today, you’d never guess that this fully functional, pristine miniature steam train is pushing 100 years of age, a throwback to a time when a movie cost a quarter and bottle of Coke was only five cents. It is one of only three remaining 22-inch gauge engines left in the world. Little Puffer is an integral part of the San Francisco Zoo’s history and an important part of the Zoo today.

**History**

  * **1904** – Around the turn of the 20th century, the renowned Cagney Brothers’ Miniature Railroad Company, based in New York City, manufactured a few 22-inch gauge “Class E” miniature steam locomotives. One of these won the Grand Prize for Freight and Passenger Locomotives at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition. It is believed that only six or seven of these remarkable trains were built. Though some were sold for mining operations, mills and amusement rides, the Zoo train may indeed have actually operated at Louisiana Purchase Exposition.



  * **1907-1915** – Records indicate that the train was in service along a sandy beach in Santa Cruz from 1907 to 1915. After this, it is believed that the train was almost destroyed in a warehouse fire.



  


  * **1908-1910** – In an analysis of old photos taken in Santa Cruz during this time, the Golden Gate Railroad Museum (GGRM) ascertained that this particular train was most likely built around 1904. The evidence was an unusual bent coupler, seen in one photo, the same as the train has now.



  * **1920s** – Ford car dealer Joseph Cornelius Hayes purportedly purchases the train. It had been sold for scrap by the operation in Santa Cruz when Hayes and a partner discovered the train in a scrap yard near Third and Brannan Streets in San Francisco. The story suggests that the train was purchased as scrap metal in exchange for “three cases of gin and an old Oldsmobile.”



  * **1920-1924** – Around that time the train was thought to be restored for relocation to San Francisco’s Ocean Beach. However, after Fire Commissioners would not issue a permit as the locomotive was a coal burner and consequently a fire hazard, another site was considered. This more promising site was an amusement park in San Mateo, CA called Pacific City but it closed due to financial woes soon after it opened in 1924. To avoid having the train impounded, it was removed and hidden for two years in an old abandoned livery stable in Burlingame.



  * **1925 –** Herbert Fleishhacker purchases the train and installs it at the new Herbert Fleishhacker Zoo, where it remains for 53 years.



  * **1935** – newspapers tout the Fleishhacker Playfield Limited as the only train in San Francisco to make daily runs with full passenger loads every trip. The operating costs consisted of the coal burned by the locomotive and the salary of one man who served as engineer, conductor, fireman, oiler and shop man.



  * Although much of Little Puffer’s early history at the Zoo is unavailable, it is known that the little steam train carried about 100,000 visitors a year during its heyday, running a capacity of 42 passengers in three cars around a third-of-a-mile track for about three minutes.



  * **1965** – Little Puffer is renamed “The California Zephyr” after Western Pacific Railroad sponsors a restoration of the train and its tracks.



  * **1971** – According to a newspaper article, plans were made to retire the train and replace it with a larger train on a bigger, longer track, powered by a Ford tractor engine. The new train and tracks were to cost $300,000, but plans fell through.



  * **1978 **– Although it had then been scheduled to retire in 1971, it wasn’t until 1978 that the train was finally packed away to make room for Gorilla World, an exhibit that opened in 1980.



**Back in Service**

**  
**The little train languished in storage for 20 years until the tired and dilapidated steamer was dusted off and taken out of storage in The Pachyderm House with two Asian elephants, a grey seal and a pygmy hippo. Time had not been kind to Little Puffer. She was in a sad state of disrepair, with parts missing and splintered and chipped wood in the passenger cars.

It was 1997, and through the generous support of the Richard and Rhoda Goldman Fund, California Federal Bank and the GGRM, the Zoo had what it needed to bring Little Puffer back to life. San Francisco’s GGRM, a nationally-recognized organization dedicated to the preservation and exhibition of historic railroad equipment, went to work to restore the historic steam train.

Working with outside contractors, such as PG&E, track architects, bodywork and boiler specialists, the reconstruction team took to the challenge. GGRM members, all volunteers, disassembled, reassembled, painted, welded, sandblasted, fitted and created train gears, parts and pieces to recreate the miniature train. They also retrofitted it to run on cleaner-burning natural gas. Meanwhile, the Zoo started laying track for the new, longer route. The cost to renovate the train, which sold for just $15,000 in a 1905 Cagney catalog, was approximately $75,000. The addition of the new depot, plaza area, track layout, landscaping and storage barn facility, brought the cost to $700,000.

San Francisco Zoo & Gardens Accessibility Statement

## Accessibility Statement

### Compliance status:

We strongly believe in the importance of making the Internet available and accessible to everyone. Therefore, we are dedicated to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of their circumstances or abilities.

To achieve this goal, we strive to adhere closely to the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1) at the AA level. These guidelines provide instructions on how to make web content accessible to people with various disabilities. By following these guidelines, we ensure that our website is accessible to individuals with visual impairments, motor impairments, cognitive disabilities, and more.

Our website incorporates technologies that enhance accessibility at all times. We utilize an accessibility interface that allows users with specific disabilities to customize the website's user interface (UI) according to their needs.

Additionally, our website employs an AI-based application that continuously optimizes its accessibility level. This application enhances the website's HTML and adjusts its functionality and behavior for screen-reader users and individuals with motor impairments.

If you come across any malfunctions or have suggestions for improvement, we welcome your feedback. Please contact the website's operators at the following email address: [contactEmail].

#### Screen reader and keyboard navigation:

Our website has implemented the ARIA attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) technique and other behavioral modifications to ensure that visitors using screen readers can effectively read, understand, and interact with the website. Upon entering the site, screen reader users are prompted to enter the Screen-Reader Profile, enabling them to browse and navigate the website seamlessly. Here are some important ways our website addresses screen reader requirements:

#### Screen-reader optimization:

We employ a background process that comprehensively learns the website's components, ensuring ongoing compliance even during updates. This process provides screen readers with meaningful data using ARIA attributes. For instance, we provide accurate form labels, descriptions for actionable icons (e.g., social media icons, search icons, cart icons), validation guidance for form inputs, and proper roles for elements like buttons, menus, and modal dialogues. Additionally, the background process scans all website images, generating accurate and meaningful descriptions using image-object-recognition-based ALT tags. It also extracts embedded text within images using optical character recognition (OCR) technology. Users can activate screen reader adjustments at any time by pressing the Alt+1 keyboard combination. Upon entering the website, screen reader users receive automatic announcements to enable the Screen-Reader mode.

#### Keyboard navigation optimization:

The background process enhances the website's HTML and adds JavaScript code to enable keyboard operability. This includes features such as navigating the website using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys, operating dropdown menus with arrow keys, closing them with Esc, triggering buttons and links using the Enter key, navigating between radio buttons and checkboxes with arrow keys, and filling them in with the Spacebar or Enter key. Keyboard users can access quick navigation and content-skip menus at any time by pressing Alt+1 or by finding them as the first elements while navigating using the keyboard. The background process also handles triggered popups by focusing the keyboard on them when they appear, preventing the focus from drifting outside.

Our adjustments are compatible with popular screen readers like JAWS and NVDA.
