## At the Zoo

The Zoo’s large forested cassowary exhibit is between the Australian WalkAbout and South American Tropical Rainforest and Aviary.

## Fascinating Facts

  * The double-wattled cassowary is also referred to as the southern cassowary.
  * Cassowaries are the only large flightless bird adapted for life in the rainforest.
  * For the Kalam people of New Guinea, cassowaries are believed to be reincarnations of their female ancestors, for which reason it is forbidden to hunt or trade the birds.
  * This bird belongs to a group of large, flightless birds called ratites, of which, the southern cassowary is one of the heaviest, second only to the ostrich.



## Physical Characteristics

Cassowaries are massive birds that can measure up to six feet in height and weigh 100-150 pounds. The southern cassowary is the largest of the three species of cassowary. The feet have three toes with a stout claw, while the middle toe has a long dagger-like claw. They have long, powerful legs and can run up to 30 miles per hour through thick underbrush with the neck stretched forward and body horizontal. The black-colored plumage is extremely hard and coarse, protecting the body from thorns and sharp leaves. The head and neck are a brilliant blue and red. Female cassowaries are larger than males and generally brighter in color.

Chicks have brown and creamy-white stripes, eventually fading to brown after about six months. Juvenile coloration darkens as the birds mature, which takes around three years.

Cassowaries have a structure on the head resembling a helmet, called a casque. The purpose of the casque is not fully understood. The most common theory is that the animal uses it to force its way through dense vegetation, avoiding injury to its head. Observation of captive birds shows it being used as a shovel in search of food among leaf litter. Just like the wattles, brightly colored folds of skin on the head and neck, the casque may also be an indicator of social status and dominance, as it grows slowly throughout the bird’s life.

They are great jumpers; maneuverable in dense forest spaces, and surprisingly, excellent swimmers and divers.

Lifespan in the wild is 12-19 years in the wild, and around 40 years under human care.

## Habitat/Diet

Cassowaries are found in the rain forest and savanna woodland areas of New Guinea and northeastern Australia.

They eat a diet of fruit, insects, eggs, frogs, fungi and carrion.

## Social Behavior

They are solitary except in breeding season, and are very territorial. They are active in the morning and late afternoon, and occasionally during moonlit nights. Usually shy, a cassowary can become quite aggressive during breeding. This is especially true when accompanied by chicks, or cornered. To defend themselves they use their sharp clawed feet to kick predators.

These large birds produce a variety of sounds, ranging from booming low frequency territorial calls to the coughing call used by an adult male to maintain contact with chicks.

Cassowaries tend to breed when fruit is most abundant, usually from June to October. The male makes the nest, a shallow depression scooped in the ground and lined with grass and leaves, well camouflaged in the rainforest. Males only mate with a single female, but once 3-5 green eggs are laid, the female goes off to find another mate and usually lays two or three clutches during one breeding cycle. Like emu and rhea, the male remains with the eggs and cares for chicks after they hatch.

Eggs are incubated for about 60 days, and chicks are able to walk and feed themselves within a few hours. Male and chicks leave the nest after about two days, and stay together about nine months.

## Status In The Wild

Southern cassowaries are listed as vulnerable by the IUCN. Their population has declined in some parts of their range by more than 30% over the last 30 years. Habitat loss and hunting are major threats.

In New Guinea, feathers are used for ceremonial headdresses and the increase in price in native markets has intensified hunting pressure. In some parts of their range, cassowaries are hunted for bushmeat as well. Additionally, chicks suffer heavy predation by dogs and feral pigs; this predation may have a serious effect on cassowaries in Australia.

San Francisco Zoo participates in the AZA coordinated Population Management Plan for cassowaries, exchanging information on diets, behavior, and cassowary health with 26 other AZA facilities currently housing the species.

San Francisco Zoo & Gardens Accessibility Statement

## Accessibility Statement

### Compliance status:

We strongly believe in the importance of making the Internet available and accessible to everyone. Therefore, we are dedicated to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of their circumstances or abilities.

To achieve this goal, we strive to adhere closely to the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1) at the AA level. These guidelines provide instructions on how to make web content accessible to people with various disabilities. By following these guidelines, we ensure that our website is accessible to individuals with visual impairments, motor impairments, cognitive disabilities, and more.

Our website incorporates technologies that enhance accessibility at all times. We utilize an accessibility interface that allows users with specific disabilities to customize the website's user interface (UI) according to their needs.

Additionally, our website employs an AI-based application that continuously optimizes its accessibility level. This application enhances the website's HTML and adjusts its functionality and behavior for screen-reader users and individuals with motor impairments.

If you come across any malfunctions or have suggestions for improvement, we welcome your feedback. Please contact the website's operators at the following email address: [contactEmail].

#### Screen reader and keyboard navigation:

Our website has implemented the ARIA attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) technique and other behavioral modifications to ensure that visitors using screen readers can effectively read, understand, and interact with the website. Upon entering the site, screen reader users are prompted to enter the Screen-Reader Profile, enabling them to browse and navigate the website seamlessly. Here are some important ways our website addresses screen reader requirements:

#### Screen-reader optimization:

We employ a background process that comprehensively learns the website's components, ensuring ongoing compliance even during updates. This process provides screen readers with meaningful data using ARIA attributes. For instance, we provide accurate form labels, descriptions for actionable icons (e.g., social media icons, search icons, cart icons), validation guidance for form inputs, and proper roles for elements like buttons, menus, and modal dialogues. Additionally, the background process scans all website images, generating accurate and meaningful descriptions using image-object-recognition-based ALT tags. It also extracts embedded text within images using optical character recognition (OCR) technology. Users can activate screen reader adjustments at any time by pressing the Alt+1 keyboard combination. Upon entering the website, screen reader users receive automatic announcements to enable the Screen-Reader mode.

#### Keyboard navigation optimization:

The background process enhances the website's HTML and adds JavaScript code to enable keyboard operability. This includes features such as navigating the website using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys, operating dropdown menus with arrow keys, closing them with Esc, triggering buttons and links using the Enter key, navigating between radio buttons and checkboxes with arrow keys, and filling them in with the Spacebar or Enter key. Keyboard users can access quick navigation and content-skip menus at any time by pressing Alt+1 or by finding them as the first elements while navigating using the keyboard. The background process also handles triggered popups by focusing the keyboard on them when they appear, preventing the focus from drifting outside.

Our adjustments are compatible with popular screen readers like JAWS and NVDA.
