# Fascinating Animals at San Francisco Zoo & Gardens

Nov 28, 2023

The San Francisco Zoo & Gardens stands as a remarkable sanctuary for wildlife enthusiasts and conservation advocates alike. This facility is not merely a home to over 2,000 fascinating animals, representing more than 250 species; it is also a vital player in preserving these creatures’ habitats and ensuring their survival. From its endangered inhabitants to the [tireless conservation efforts](https://www.sfzoo.org/animal-adoption-programs/?utm_source=blog+post&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Fascinating+Animals+at+SF+Zoo), there is a world of intrigue within this zoo’s lush surroundings. Let’s delve into some of the remarkable animals and conservation initiatives that make San Francisco Zoo & Gardens truly unique.

## Mexican Gray Wolves: Guardians of Wolf Canyon

The sight of Mexican gray wolves in their natural habitat is a rarity, as these small wolves are nearly extinct in the wild. [The San Francisco Zoo plays a pivotal role in their conservation by providing them a safe haven in Wolf Canyon.](https://www.sfzoo.org/mexican-gray-wolf/?utm_source=blog+post&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Fascinating+Animals+at+SF+Zoo) Visitors can experience a 270-degree view of their habitat, fostering a deep appreciation for these magnificent creatures. The zoo actively contributes to the preservation of this species, which is listed on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

### Fascinating Facts:

  * Mexican gray wolves are often referred to as ‘el lobo’, which means ‘wolf’ in Spanish.
  * They have an excellent sense of smell, keen vision, and sharp hearing.



## Lemurs: Madagascar’s Marvels in the Heart of San Francisco

The San Francisco Zoo boasts the [largest outdoor lemur habitat in the U.S., offering a rare opportunity to observe these active and engaging primates](https://www.sfzoo.org/lipman-family-lemur-forest/?utm_source=blog+post&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Fascinating+Animals+at+SF+Zoo). Originating from Madagascar, lemurs delight visitors with their tree-hopping antics. In this expansive enclosure, lemurs leap from tree to tree, reflecting their vibrant existence in the wild. This multi-species habitat houses ring-tailed lemurs, blue-eyed black lemurs, black and white ruffed lemurs, crowned lemurs, red bellied lemurs, red fronted lemurs, and red ruffed lemurs. This exhibit helps raise awareness about the importance of preserving the natural resources of their native habitat.

## Gorillas: The Majesty of the Jones Family Gorilla Preserve

In the lush surroundings of the [Jones Family Gorilla Preserve](https://www.sfzoo.org/jones-family-gorilla-preserve/?utm_source=blog+post&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Fascinating+Animals+at+SF+Zoo), the zoo’s troop of gorillas thrives. Visitors are treated to an immersive experience, witnessing these majestic creatures interact with each other and their environment. Knowledgeable zookeepers provide insights into the lives of gorillas, emphasizing the importance of wildlife conservation. A wall of viewing windows lets you see the gorillas up-close as they rest, play, eat and interact with one another. In addition, there are innovative graphics to help tell the story of these gentle giants.

## Penguins: Penguin Island’s Magellanic Marvels

Penguin Island at the San Francisco Zoo is a haven for Magellanic penguins. This island sanctuary is home to the [largest colony of these penguins outside of the wild](https://www.sfzoo.org/magellanic-penguin/?utm_source=blog+post&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Fascinating+Animals+at+SF+Zoo). Visitors can get up close to these charismatic birds, observing their playful antics in the water and during feeding times. This experience educates visitors about the impact of invasive species and habitat loss on penguin populations, making them an important part of the zoo’s educational mission.

### Fascinating Facts:

  * Penguin fossils date back to the Eocene period, 50 million years ago, and penguin ancestors were larger than the present-day emperor penguin, which measures almost 4 feet.
  * The Magellanic penguin is one of 17 penguin species, all of which live in the southern hemisphere. Not all penguins live in cold places, though; the climate in this species’ range is not that different from our climate here in northern California!



## Snow Leopards: The Majestic Marvel of Nature

The majestic snow leopard is a true marvel of nature, and at the San Francisco Zoo, visitors have the incredible opportunity to witness these elusive big cats up close. The snow leopard, known for its striking beauty and elusive nature, is a fascinating species to encounter. [With its thick fur patterned with rosettes and an agile, powerful build, it’s no wonder that these creatures are often referred to as “ghosts of the mountains.”](https://www.sfzoo.org/snow-leopard/?utm_source=blog+post&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Fascinating+Animals+at+SF+Zoo) At the San Francisco Zoo, dedicated to conservation and education, the snow leopards serve as ambassadors for their wild counterparts, raising awareness about the challenges these remarkable creatures face in their natural habitat. By visiting the snow leopards at the San Francisco Zoo and Gardens, you not only get a chance to admire their beauty but also contribute to the vital mission of wildlife preservation.

## The Zoo’s Mission

San Francisco Zoo & Gardens is not just [a place for fun and exploration](https://www.sfzoo.org/the-ultimate-guide-to-a-family-friendly-day-at-san-francisco-zoo-gardens/?utm_source=blog+post&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Fascinating+Animals+at+SF+Zoo); it’s a beacon of hope for our planet’s precious wildlife. This zoo’s mission extends beyond its borders, as it actively engages in wildlife conservation, collaborating with international organizations like the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) who manage the Red List of Threatened Species. [With its diverse collection of animals and beautiful gardens](https://www.sfzoo.org/the-diverse-plant-life-of-sf-zoos-gardens/), it’s a place where visitors not only have fun but also leave with a deeper appreciation for the urgent need for wildlife conservation and the protection of critically endangered species. It’s a journey through the animal kingdom that inspires a sense of responsibility and the hope that, with sustained efforts, we can ensure a brighter future for all species on Earth.

### Here are a few tips for making the most of your visit:

  * Plan ahead. Check the zoo’s website or app to see which animals and exhibits are open, as well as any special events that may be happening during your visit.
  * Arrive early. This will give you time to beat the crowds and see the animals when they are most active.
  * Wear comfortable shoes. You’ll be doing a lot of walking, so it’s important to wear comfortable shoes that you can easily walk in.
  * Bring sunscreen, water, and a hat. It can get hot and sunny at the zoo, so it’s important to stay hydrated and protected from the sun.
  * Take your time. Don’t try to see everything in one day. Instead, focus on a few areas and take your time enjoying the animals and exhibits.
  * Be respectful of the animals. Don’t feed the animals or tap on the glass. Simply observe them from a distance and enjoy their presence.

San Francisco Zoo & Gardens Accessibility Statement

## Accessibility Statement

### Compliance status:

We strongly believe in the importance of making the Internet available and accessible to everyone. Therefore, we are dedicated to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of their circumstances or abilities.

To achieve this goal, we strive to adhere closely to the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1) at the AA level. These guidelines provide instructions on how to make web content accessible to people with various disabilities. By following these guidelines, we ensure that our website is accessible to individuals with visual impairments, motor impairments, cognitive disabilities, and more.

Our website incorporates technologies that enhance accessibility at all times. We utilize an accessibility interface that allows users with specific disabilities to customize the website's user interface (UI) according to their needs.

Additionally, our website employs an AI-based application that continuously optimizes its accessibility level. This application enhances the website's HTML and adjusts its functionality and behavior for screen-reader users and individuals with motor impairments.

If you come across any malfunctions or have suggestions for improvement, we welcome your feedback. Please contact the website's operators at the following email address: [contactEmail].

#### Screen reader and keyboard navigation:

Our website has implemented the ARIA attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) technique and other behavioral modifications to ensure that visitors using screen readers can effectively read, understand, and interact with the website. Upon entering the site, screen reader users are prompted to enter the Screen-Reader Profile, enabling them to browse and navigate the website seamlessly. Here are some important ways our website addresses screen reader requirements:

#### Screen-reader optimization:

We employ a background process that comprehensively learns the website's components, ensuring ongoing compliance even during updates. This process provides screen readers with meaningful data using ARIA attributes. For instance, we provide accurate form labels, descriptions for actionable icons (e.g., social media icons, search icons, cart icons), validation guidance for form inputs, and proper roles for elements like buttons, menus, and modal dialogues. Additionally, the background process scans all website images, generating accurate and meaningful descriptions using image-object-recognition-based ALT tags. It also extracts embedded text within images using optical character recognition (OCR) technology. Users can activate screen reader adjustments at any time by pressing the Alt+1 keyboard combination. Upon entering the website, screen reader users receive automatic announcements to enable the Screen-Reader mode.

#### Keyboard navigation optimization:

The background process enhances the website's HTML and adds JavaScript code to enable keyboard operability. This includes features such as navigating the website using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys, operating dropdown menus with arrow keys, closing them with Esc, triggering buttons and links using the Enter key, navigating between radio buttons and checkboxes with arrow keys, and filling them in with the Spacebar or Enter key. Keyboard users can access quick navigation and content-skip menus at any time by pressing Alt+1 or by finding them as the first elements while navigating using the keyboard. The background process also handles triggered popups by focusing the keyboard on them when they appear, preventing the focus from drifting outside.

Our adjustments are compatible with popular screen readers like JAWS and NVDA.

### Disability profiles supported on our website:

Our website provides various disability profiles to support individuals with specific accessibility needs:

  * Epilepsy Safe Mode: This profile eliminates the risk of seizures caused by flashing or blinking animations and risky color combinations.
  * Visually Impaired Mode: This mode adjusts the website to accommodate users with visual impairments such as Degrading Eyesight, Tunnel Vision, Cataracts, Glaucoma, and others.
  * Cognitive Disability Mode: This mode offers assistive options for users with cognitive impairments such as Dyslexia, Autism, CVA, and others, helping them focus on essential website elements.
  * ADHD-Friendly Mode: This mode assists users with ADHD and Neurodevelopmental disorders in reading, browsing, and maintaining focus on the main website elements while reducing distractions.
  * Blindness Mode: This mode ensures compatibility with screen readers such as JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and TalkBack, which are essential software for blind users.
  * Keyboard Navigation Profile (Motor-Impaired): This profile enables individuals with motor impairments to navigate the website using keyboard keys like Tab, Shift+Tab, and Enter. Users can also utilize shortcuts like "M" for menus, "H" for headings, "F" for forms, "B" for buttons, and "G" for graphics to jump to specific elements.



###   
Additional UI, design, and readability adjustments:

We offer several UI, design, and readability adjustments to enhance the user experience for all visitors:

  * Font adjustments: Users can modify the font size, family (type), spacing, alignment, line height, and more.
  * Color adjustments: Users can select different color contrast profiles (light, dark, inverted, monochrome) and swap color schemes for titles, texts, and backgrounds using over seven different coloring options.
  * Animations: Epileptic users can stop all animations, including videos, GIFs, and CSS flashing transitions, with a single click.
  * Content highlighting: Users can emphasize important elements such as links and titles or choose to highlight only focused or hovered elements.
  * Audio muting: Users with hearing devices can instantly mute the entire website to avoid headaches or other issues caused by automatic audio playback.
  * Cognitive disorders: We utilize a search engine linked to Wikipedia and Wiktionary, allowing users with cognitive disorders to decipher the meanings of phrases, initials, slang, and other content.
  * Additional functions: We provide users with options to change cursor color and size, activate a printing mode, enable a virtual keyboard, and access many other features.



###   
Browser and assistive technology compatibility:

We strive to support a wide range of browsers and assistive technologies, allowing users to choose the tools that best suit their needs. Our website has been extensively tested and works well on major systems, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera, and Microsoft Edge. We ensure compatibility with screen readers like JAWS and NVDA, both for Windows and MAC users.

### Notes, comments, and feedback:

While we have made significant efforts to make our website accessible to everyone, there may still be pages or sections that are not fully accessible or lack adequate technological solutions. We are continuously improving our accessibility features, incorporating new technologies, and working towards achieving the optimal level of accessibility. If you require assistance or have any feedback, please contact us at [contactEmail].
