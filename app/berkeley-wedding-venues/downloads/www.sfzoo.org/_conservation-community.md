[**AZA SAFE Monarch Program**](https://www.aza.org/safe-species)  
San Francisco Zoo & Gardens is an institutional partner in the AZA SAFE Monarch Program supporting the conservation goals of the program to protect the iconic butterfly. The long-term goal fo AZA SAFE North America Monarch Program is to increase zoos’ and aquariums’ conservation leadership throughout North America in order to bolster habitat for migratory monarch butterflies. This critical action is needed to recover and sustain there butterfly populations, which are in steep decline, especially in the western US.

San Francisco Zoo staff leads the AZA SAFE Western Pond Turtle Project steering committee and several of the project objectives. The long-term goal of the Western Pond Turtle Project is to to ensure the stability of remaining Western Pond Turtle populations and support healthy population growth and expansion within the species’ range. The program and its partners are implementing projects that directly address the threats impacting the species, including head-starting, reintroduction efforts and the formation of a range-wide conservation coalition throughout its range.

******[AZA Species Survival Plan (SSP](http://www.aza.org/species-survival-plan-program/))**  
We are pleased to participate in 82 AZA cooperative breeding programs which help conserve species. The Zoo contributes annual financial support to some SSP programs.

[**Earthwatch Institute**](https://earthwatch.org/)  
Earthwatch connects people with scientists worldwide to conduct environmental research and empowers them with the knowledge they need to conserve the plant. Our employees and volunteers have participated in Earthwatch expeditions for over 30 years as part of professional training opportunities offered to staff in all departments.

**Jane Goodall Institute**  
The institute is a global community conservation organization that advances the vision and work of Dr. Jane Goodall. By protecting chimpanzees and inspiring people to conserve the natural world we all share, to improve the lives of people, animals and the environment.

[**Madagascar Fauna Group**](https://www.madagascarfaunaflora.org/)  
Our continued support the Madagascar Fauna Group and Parc Ivoloina has grown to include not only financial support but also an advisory role with zoo staff elected to the Board of Advisors.

[**National Network for Ocean Climate Change Interpretation (NNOCC)**](https://climateinterpreter.org/about/projects/NNOCCI)  
NNOCCI offers resources and training to help others strengthen their voices to increase our collective impact in promoting climate action. Our education staff are essential members of this important group and work as part of the team to conduct regular trainings to new members.

[**Polar Bears International – Arctic Ambassador Center**](https://polarbearsinternational.org/get-involved/arctic-ambassador-centers)  
Arctic Ambassador Centers (AACs) are a collection of zoos, museums, and aquariums that educate the public about climate change and how we can help, and provide leadership for carbon-emission reductions in their communities. We are proud to partner with Polar Bears International to sustain a future for polar bears across the Arctic.

[**Snow Leopard Conservancy (SLC)**](http://snowleopardconservancy.org/)  
SLC builds upon traditional beliefs and empowers communities to benefit economically by maintaining a balanced ecosystem for the snow leopard. Using a One Health approach to improve livestock health and husbandry, and reduce retaliatory killings of Snow Leopards from depredation losses in Nepal. We partnered with SLC and International Veterinary Outreach in an effort to reduce the herder retaliation on snow leopards for livestock deaths. A Health and Husbandry Team, which includes zoos staff, is working to train Nepalese herders in improved livestock health and husbandry.

[**Wild Welfare**](https://wildwelfare.org/)  
No matter how much conservation zoos do, questionable animal welfare at any zoo is a roadblock to each of us reaching our mission. We have created a partnership with Wild Welfare, a group focused on helping to bring up the welfare state of animals in non-accredited zoos, which will allow San Francisco Zoo & Gardens to join their efforts to positively influence animal welfare across the globe. The Zoo’s Integrated Animal Welfare Team, Animal Care Team and Education staff is sharing knowledge with South American zoos who seek to learn best practices by assessing, ensuring and messaging the welfare of their animals through site visits and training programs. A primary goal is to help currently non-accredited institutions seek accreditation that holds welfare to a high standard.

Above is a partial list and reflects SF Zoo contributions.

San Francisco Zoo & Gardens Accessibility Statement

## Accessibility Statement

### Compliance status:

We strongly believe in the importance of making the Internet available and accessible to everyone. Therefore, we are dedicated to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of their circumstances or abilities.

To achieve this goal, we strive to adhere closely to the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1) at the AA level. These guidelines provide instructions on how to make web content accessible to people with various disabilities. By following these guidelines, we ensure that our website is accessible to individuals with visual impairments, motor impairments, cognitive disabilities, and more.

Our website incorporates technologies that enhance accessibility at all times. We utilize an accessibility interface that allows users with specific disabilities to customize the website's user interface (UI) according to their needs.

Additionally, our website employs an AI-based application that continuously optimizes its accessibility level. This application enhances the website's HTML and adjusts its functionality and behavior for screen-reader users and individuals with motor impairments.

If you come across any malfunctions or have suggestions for improvement, we welcome your feedback. Please contact the website's operators at the following email address: [contactEmail].

#### Screen reader and keyboard navigation:

Our website has implemented the ARIA attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) technique and other behavioral modifications to ensure that visitors using screen readers can effectively read, understand, and interact with the website. Upon entering the site, screen reader users are prompted to enter the Screen-Reader Profile, enabling them to browse and navigate the website seamlessly. Here are some important ways our website addresses screen reader requirements:

#### Screen-reader optimization:

We employ a background process that comprehensively learns the website's components, ensuring ongoing compliance even during updates. This process provides screen readers with meaningful data using ARIA attributes. For instance, we provide accurate form labels, descriptions for actionable icons (e.g., social media icons, search icons, cart icons), validation guidance for form inputs, and proper roles for elements like buttons, menus, and modal dialogues. Additionally, the background process scans all website images, generating accurate and meaningful descriptions using image-object-recognition-based ALT tags. It also extracts embedded text within images using optical character recognition (OCR) technology. Users can activate screen reader adjustments at any time by pressing the Alt+1 keyboard combination. Upon entering the website, screen reader users receive automatic announcements to enable the Screen-Reader mode.

#### Keyboard navigation optimization:

The background process enhances the website's HTML and adds JavaScript code to enable keyboard operability. This includes features such as navigating the website using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys, operating dropdown menus with arrow keys, closing them with Esc, triggering buttons and links using the Enter key, navigating between radio buttons and checkboxes with arrow keys, and filling them in with the Spacebar or Enter key. Keyboard users can access quick navigation and content-skip menus at any time by pressing Alt+1 or by finding them as the first elements while navigating using the keyboard. The background process also handles triggered popups by focusing the keyboard on them when they appear, preventing the focus from drifting outside.

Our adjustments are compatible with popular screen readers like JAWS and NVDA.

### Disability profiles supported on our website:

Our website provides various disability profiles to support individuals with specific accessibility needs:

  * Epilepsy Safe Mode: This profile eliminates the risk of seizures caused by flashing or blinking animations and risky color combinations.
  * Visually Impaired Mode: This mode adjusts the website to accommodate users with visual impairments such as Degrading Eyesight, Tunnel Vision, Cataracts, Glaucoma, and others.
  * Cognitive Disability Mode: This mode offers assistive options for users with cognitive impairments such as Dyslexia, Autism, CVA, and others, helping them focus on essential website elements.
  * ADHD-Friendly Mode: This mode assists users with ADHD and Neurodevelopmental disorders in reading, browsing, and maintaining focus on the main website elements while reducing distractions.
  * Blindness Mode: This mode ensures compatibility with screen readers such as JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and TalkBack, which are essential software for blind users.
  * Keyboard Navigation Profile (Motor-Impaired): This profile enables individuals with motor impairments to navigate the website using keyboard keys like Tab, Shift+Tab, and Enter. Users can also utilize shortcuts like "M" for menus, "H" for headings, "F" for forms, "B" for buttons, and "G" for graphics to jump to specific elements.



###   
Additional UI, design, and readability adjustments:

We offer several UI, design, and readability adjustments to enhance the user experience for all visitors:

  * Font adjustments: Users can modify the font size, family (type), spacing, alignment, line height, and more.
  * Color adjustments: Users can select different color contrast profiles (light, dark, inverted, monochrome) and swap color schemes for titles, texts, and backgrounds using over seven different coloring options.
  * Animations: Epileptic users can stop all animations, including videos, GIFs, and CSS flashing transitions, with a single click.
  * Content highlighting: Users can emphasize important elements such as links and titles or choose to highlight only focused or hovered elements.
  * Audio muting: Users with hearing devices can instantly mute the entire website to avoid headaches or other issues caused by automatic audio playback.
  * Cognitive disorders: We utilize a search engine linked to Wikipedia and Wiktionary, allowing users with cognitive disorders to decipher the meanings of phrases, initials, slang, and other content.
  * Additional functions: We provide users with options to change cursor color and size, activate a printing mode, enable a virtual keyboard, and access many other features.



###   
Browser and assistive technology compatibility:

We strive to support a wide range of browsers and assistive technologies, allowing users to choose the tools that best suit their needs. Our website has been extensively tested and works well on major systems, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera, and Microsoft Edge. We ensure compatibility with screen readers like JAWS and NVDA, both for Windows and MAC users.

### Notes, comments, and feedback:

While we have made significant efforts to make our website accessible to everyone, there may still be pages or sections that are not fully accessible or lack adequate technological solutions. We are continuously improving our accessibility features, incorporating new technologies, and working towards achieving the optimal level of accessibility. If you require assistance or have any feedback, please contact us at [contactEmail].
