## At the Zoo

The Zoo’s black-tailed prairie dogs can be found in the Exploration Zone’s popular Meerkat and Prairie Dog exhibit, featuring two burrowing animal species from different parts of the world. Both species can be seen up close through viewing windows and visitors can learn about the fascinating underground world of these animals through interactive activities and displays.

There are over 20 prairie dogs in the colony at the Zoo – see how many you can count next time you visit!

## Fascinating Facts

  * The biggest prairie dog town on record was about 100 miles wide and 250 miles long, and home to an estimated 400 million prairie dogs.
  * Prairie dogs got their name from their most common call, a short yip that sounds like a bark. Of course, prairie dogs aren’t dogs at all; they’re actually a species of squirrel.
  * A prairie dog burrow will often have 30-50 burrow entrances per acre.



## Physical Characteristics

Prairie dogs have a stout, squirrel-like body and short legs. Adults stand about 12 inches tall and weigh from one to three pounds. They’re tan to pale brown in color with a flattened black-tipped tail. Prairie dogs stand on their hind legs when looking for danger.

Life span in the wild is 3-5 years, and up to 8 years under human care.

## Habitat/Diet

Black-tailed prairie dogs inhabit the open plains and plateaus of the Great Plains from Montana and southern Saskatchewan to extreme northern Mexico.

Black-tailed prairie dogs are known as a keystone species and play an important role in prairie ecology. More than 165 species of animals and insects depend on them for survival, including black-footed ferrets, coyotes, bald eagles, swift fox, golden eagles and mountain plovers. Plants and invertebrates also rely heavily on prairie dogs. Their extensive burrows acts as homes for such animals as burrowing owls, snakes and badgers. They are a critical food source for many mammal and bird species, and the constant burrowing activity of prairie dogs works to loosen the soil, unearthing insects that birds eat.

In the wild, the prairie dog diet consists primarily of grasses, roots and blossoms. Grasses make up about three quarters of their diet, and in the spring and summer, each prairie dog consumes up to two pounds of vegetation per week. At the Zoo, the prairie dogs eat vegetables, monkey chow, peanuts and plant browse.

## Social Behavior

Prairie dogs have a highly organized society. They live in social groups called colonies or “towns” that are subdivided into wards and then into smaller family groups called coteries, which altogether may cover areas up to 160 acres. These inter-connected burrows provide the prairie dog with refuge as well as a place to rear their young.

Prairie dogs feed above ground during the day, but use burrows for safety at night and for rearing families. The whole colony helps dig the elaborate underground tunnel system that may reach lengths of 100 feet and depths of 15 feet. The burrows consist of several chambers, including a nursery, a latrine, a grass-lined nesting chamber, and a listening post located near the surface where the inhabitants keep tabs on above-ground activities that might spell danger.

Black-tailed prairie dogs have a sophisticated communication system; with a host of calls, postures and displays that are used to alert the group of the presence of predators, such as coyotes, bobcats, badgers, black-footed ferrets, golden eagles and hawks. Scientists have discovered that prairie dogs can even discriminate between airborne and ground predators, as well as individual humans dressed in different clothing! An alarm call is sounded to warn of a predator: a sharp bark, followed by a quick descent into the burrow. When the predator is gone, a special “all-clear” call informs family members that the danger has passed. Other communications include mouth-to-mouth contact, or “kissing,” used to identify coterie members from those outside their group.

## Status In The Wild

Black-tailed prairie dogs are listed as least concern by the IUCN. Though population is declining due to destruction of habitat, prairie dogs are still rather common. In the early 1800’s, they roamed most of the western United States and numbered about five billion. Today, 99% of that population is gone, attributed to a decades-long government-funded eradication program that eliminated prairie dogs by hunting and poisoning. Farming and development since then has reduced the prairie dog’s habitat to less than one percent of its historic size – from over 100 million acres to less than one million acres.

Many ranchers mistakenly believe prairie dogs compete with cattle for rangelands, when in reality they have a symbiotic relationship whereby prairie dogs serve as natural fertilizers, improving the forage for cattle while cattle grazing allows prairie dog colonies to expand.

Protecting the prairie dog can also help save other species. For example, black-footed ferrets inhabit prairie dog burrows and depend on them for more than 95% of their dietary needs. The war against the prairie dog is the main reason the black-footed ferret is now one of America’s most endangered mammals.

San Francisco Zoo & Gardens Accessibility Statement

## Accessibility Statement

### Compliance status:

We strongly believe in the importance of making the Internet available and accessible to everyone. Therefore, we are dedicated to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of their circumstances or abilities.

To achieve this goal, we strive to adhere closely to the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1) at the AA level. These guidelines provide instructions on how to make web content accessible to people with various disabilities. By following these guidelines, we ensure that our website is accessible to individuals with visual impairments, motor impairments, cognitive disabilities, and more.

Our website incorporates technologies that enhance accessibility at all times. We utilize an accessibility interface that allows users with specific disabilities to customize the website's user interface (UI) according to their needs.

Additionally, our website employs an AI-based application that continuously optimizes its accessibility level. This application enhances the website's HTML and adjusts its functionality and behavior for screen-reader users and individuals with motor impairments.

If you come across any malfunctions or have suggestions for improvement, we welcome your feedback. Please contact the website's operators at the following email address: [contactEmail].

#### Screen reader and keyboard navigation:

Our website has implemented the ARIA attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) technique and other behavioral modifications to ensure that visitors using screen readers can effectively read, understand, and interact with the website. Upon entering the site, screen reader users are prompted to enter the Screen-Reader Profile, enabling them to browse and navigate the website seamlessly. Here are some important ways our website addresses screen reader requirements:

#### Screen-reader optimization:

We employ a background process that comprehensively learns the website's components, ensuring ongoing compliance even during updates. This process provides screen readers with meaningful data using ARIA attributes. For instance, we provide accurate form labels, descriptions for actionable icons (e.g., social media icons, search icons, cart icons), validation guidance for form inputs, and proper roles for elements like buttons, menus, and modal dialogues. Additionally, the background process scans all website images, generating accurate and meaningful descriptions using image-object-recognition-based ALT tags. It also extracts embedded text within images using optical character recognition (OCR) technology. Users can activate screen reader adjustments at any time by pressing the Alt+1 keyboard combination. Upon entering the website, screen reader users receive automatic announcements to enable the Screen-Reader mode.

#### Keyboard navigation optimization:

The background process enhances the website's HTML and adds JavaScript code to enable keyboard operability. This includes features such as navigating the website using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys, operating dropdown menus with arrow keys, closing them with Esc, triggering buttons and links using the Enter key, navigating between radio buttons and checkboxes with arrow keys, and filling them in with the Spacebar or Enter key. Keyboard users can access quick navigation and content-skip menus at any time by pressing Alt+1 or by finding them as the first elements while navigating using the keyboard. The background process also handles triggered popups by focusing the keyboard on them when they appear, preventing the focus from drifting outside.

Our adjustments are compatible with popular screen readers like JAWS and NVDA.
