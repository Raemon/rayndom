# San Francisco Zoo & Gardens Website and Mobile App Privacy Policies

**OVERVIEW**

The San Francisco Zoological Society D/B/A San Francisco Zoo & Gardens (“Our” “We”, or “Us”) is committed to protecting and respecting the privacy of its online users (“User”, “You” or “Your”).

The San Francisco Zoological Society (SFZS), a private 501(c)(3) organization, operates and maintains the San Francisco Zoo website (the “Site”). The purpose of this privacy policy is to give you confidence as you visit and use the site and to demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices and the protection of privacy. Your use of this website constitutes your acceptance of this privacy policy.

**Information Collected  
** SFZS collects certain information that personally identifies you only when you wish to access certain services and information. These include:

> • Purchasing a membership  
> • Purchasing Zoo admission  
> • Purchasing a ticket to a fee-based event  
> • Signing up for an educational program  
> • When subscribing to Animail, the SFZS e-newsletter  
> • When making a donation

The Site automatically recognizes visitors’ domain names and IP addresses (the number assigned to computers on the internet.) No personal information about you is revealed in this process. The Site may also gather anonymous “traffic data” that does not personally identify you for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer.

**Disclosure of Information  
** SFZS will not disclose or share any personal information you provide with any other party without your permission, except if required to do so in accordance with a court order, subpoena, or similar legal order, or state or local law, and in the event such disclosure is necessary to protect the rights, property, and safety of SFZS, its users, and other third parties.

SFZS does not sell its mailing list to any organization or company. From time to time, in an effort to increase SFZS’s membership, SFZS exchanges or sells membership information – limited to names and addresses – with other selected institutions for a one-time use basis (for that institution). If you would like to opt out of these exchanges, please send us an email at [[email protected] ](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5d3038303f382f2e35342d1d2e3b27323273322f3a)with your name and membership information and we will remove your information from these lists.

**Links  
** SFZS may provide links to third party websites and other websites may provide links to the Site. Third party websites operate according to their own terms of use and privacy policies. SFZS does not monitor or control such third party websites, and therefore you acknowledge and agree that SFZS is not responsible for the availability of such third party sites, and does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for any content, advertising, products, or other materials on or available from such sites. You further acknowledge and agree that SFZS, including the San Francisco Zoo, the City and County of San Francisco, will not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use or reliance on any such content, advertising, products, or other materials on or available from such sites. 

**Children  
** SFZS is committed to protecting children’s privacy. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 14 years of age.

**Changes to This Policy  
** SFZS may occasionally amend this policy. If we make any substantial changes in the way we use personal information, we will announce this to site visitors via a prominent announcement on this page.

**C****ontact  
** If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, our online practices, or your dealings with the Site, please contact:

**CHILDREN AND PRIVACY**

San Francisco Zoological Society is concerned about protecting children’s privacy. If you are under the age of 13, we do not want your personal information. Please do not submit any personal information to Us. We encourage parents to actively protect their children’s privacy by instructing them never to provide personal information to any individual or organization without parental permission. San Francisco Zoological Society will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. If we become aware that a child under 13 years of age has provided us with such information without consent, we will take appropriate action to remove such information from our files. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that a child under 13 years of age has provided such information to us, he or she should contact us at San Francisco Zoological Society, Attention: Marketing Department, 1 Zoo Road, San Francisco, CA 94132. There may be some areas within Our Websites where people may post messages or provide feedback, but those under the age of 13 children are again discouraged from providing any personal information. If a visitor known to be a child (younger than 13) sends an e-mail to San Francisco Zoological Society, We will only use it to respond to the e-mail and not to create profiles or otherwise retain the information.

**SECURE SHOPPING**

San Francisco Zoological Society has incorporated the latest Internet technological standards into the design of the secure purchase areas of its Websites. We also monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to access, upload, or change information on the Websites and across Our network. Under no uncertain terms, any information You send us while within the secure shipping area is protected by 128-bit “Secure Socket Layer” SSL encryption, making Your transaction safe and reliable. You can tell whether you are in our secure shopping area by viewing the “lock” or “key” at the bottom of your browser—an unlocked or broken key (depending on your browser) means you are in an unsecured area.

Shopping on the Internet is safe, and online credit card transactions are no more risky than other means of shopping. Our encryption methods make credit card fraud even more difficult than mail or phone orders, or even in-person purchases. If You experience fraudulent use of your credit card as a result of using Our Websites, notify your credit card company per its rules and procedures. Most credit card companies will either cover the fraudulent purchases or hold you liable for no more than $50.

As a standard Internet practice, should your credit card company hold you liable for some portion of a fraudulent charge stemming from Our Website(s), We will reimburse You for the maximum liability of $50, provided the purchase was made through Our secure server.

San Francisco Zoological Society requires the use of Your name, e-mail address, shipping address, and credit card number/expiration date in order to process and fulfill Your order. We might also request additional information that you choose to submit about your interests or feedback about our Website(s) and products so that We can provide a better shopping experience for You. The name, address, and payment information that a User might provide when using Our Websites may be processed or disclosed by San Francisco Zoological Society as permitted under such Website’s Terms of Use, to which the User agrees to upon utilizing the information and services of the Websites.

**YOUR CONSENT AND CHANGES TO POLICY**

By using our Website(s), You consent to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use. This Privacy Policy may be changed at any time. Please check this page periodically for any changes. Your continued use of Our Website(s) following the posting of any changes constitutes Your acceptance of the changes.

San Francisco Zoo & Gardens Accessibility Statement

## Accessibility Statement

### Compliance status:

We strongly believe in the importance of making the Internet available and accessible to everyone. Therefore, we are dedicated to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of their circumstances or abilities.

To achieve this goal, we strive to adhere closely to the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1) at the AA level. These guidelines provide instructions on how to make web content accessible to people with various disabilities. By following these guidelines, we ensure that our website is accessible to individuals with visual impairments, motor impairments, cognitive disabilities, and more.

Our website incorporates technologies that enhance accessibility at all times. We utilize an accessibility interface that allows users with specific disabilities to customize the website's user interface (UI) according to their needs.

Additionally, our website employs an AI-based application that continuously optimizes its accessibility level. This application enhances the website's HTML and adjusts its functionality and behavior for screen-reader users and individuals with motor impairments.

If you come across any malfunctions or have suggestions for improvement, we welcome your feedback. Please contact the website's operators at the following email address: [contactEmail].

#### Screen reader and keyboard navigation:

Our website has implemented the ARIA attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) technique and other behavioral modifications to ensure that visitors using screen readers can effectively read, understand, and interact with the website. Upon entering the site, screen reader users are prompted to enter the Screen-Reader Profile, enabling them to browse and navigate the website seamlessly. Here are some important ways our website addresses screen reader requirements:

#### Screen-reader optimization:

We employ a background process that comprehensively learns the website's components, ensuring ongoing compliance even during updates. This process provides screen readers with meaningful data using ARIA attributes. For instance, we provide accurate form labels, descriptions for actionable icons (e.g., social media icons, search icons, cart icons), validation guidance for form inputs, and proper roles for elements like buttons, menus, and modal dialogues. Additionally, the background process scans all website images, generating accurate and meaningful descriptions using image-object-recognition-based ALT tags. It also extracts embedded text within images using optical character recognition (OCR) technology. Users can activate screen reader adjustments at any time by pressing the Alt+1 keyboard combination. Upon entering the website, screen reader users receive automatic announcements to enable the Screen-Reader mode.

#### Keyboard navigation optimization:

The background process enhances the website's HTML and adds JavaScript code to enable keyboard operability. This includes features such as navigating the website using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys, operating dropdown menus with arrow keys, closing them with Esc, triggering buttons and links using the Enter key, navigating between radio buttons and checkboxes with arrow keys, and filling them in with the Spacebar or Enter key. Keyboard users can access quick navigation and content-skip menus at any time by pressing Alt+1 or by finding them as the first elements while navigating using the keyboard. The background process also handles triggered popups by focusing the keyboard on them when they appear, preventing the focus from drifting outside.

Our adjustments are compatible with popular screen readers like JAWS and NVDA.

### Disability profiles supported on our website:

Our website provides various disability profiles to support individuals with specific accessibility needs:

  * Epilepsy Safe Mode: This profile eliminates the risk of seizures caused by flashing or blinking animations and risky color combinations.
  * Visually Impaired Mode: This mode adjusts the website to accommodate users with visual impairments such as Degrading Eyesight, Tunnel Vision, Cataracts, Glaucoma, and others.
  * Cognitive Disability Mode: This mode offers assistive options for users with cognitive impairments such as Dyslexia, Autism, CVA, and others, helping them focus on essential website elements.
  * ADHD-Friendly Mode: This mode assists users with ADHD and Neurodevelopmental disorders in reading, browsing, and maintaining focus on the main website elements while reducing distractions.
  * Blindness Mode: This mode ensures compatibility with screen readers such as JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and TalkBack, which are essential software for blind users.
  * Keyboard Navigation Profile (Motor-Impaired): This profile enables individuals with motor impairments to navigate the website using keyboard keys like Tab, Shift+Tab, and Enter. Users can also utilize shortcuts like "M" for menus, "H" for headings, "F" for forms, "B" for buttons, and "G" for graphics to jump to specific elements.



###   
Additional UI, design, and readability adjustments:

We offer several UI, design, and readability adjustments to enhance the user experience for all visitors:

  * Font adjustments: Users can modify the font size, family (type), spacing, alignment, line height, and more.
  * Color adjustments: Users can select different color contrast profiles (light, dark, inverted, monochrome) and swap color schemes for titles, texts, and backgrounds using over seven different coloring options.
  * Animations: Epileptic users can stop all animations, including videos, GIFs, and CSS flashing transitions, with a single click.
  * Content highlighting: Users can emphasize important elements such as links and titles or choose to highlight only focused or hovered elements.
  * Audio muting: Users with hearing devices can instantly mute the entire website to avoid headaches or other issues caused by automatic audio playback.
  * Cognitive disorders: We utilize a search engine linked to Wikipedia and Wiktionary, allowing users with cognitive disorders to decipher the meanings of phrases, initials, slang, and other content.
  * Additional functions: We provide users with options to change cursor color and size, activate a printing mode, enable a virtual keyboard, and access many other features.



###   
Browser and assistive technology compatibility:

We strive to support a wide range of browsers and assistive technologies, allowing users to choose the tools that best suit their needs. Our website has been extensively tested and works well on major systems, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera, and Microsoft Edge. We ensure compatibility with screen readers like JAWS and NVDA, both for Windows and MAC users.

### Notes, comments, and feedback:

While we have made significant efforts to make our website accessible to everyone, there may still be pages or sections that are not fully accessible or lack adequate technological solutions. We are continuously improving our accessibility features, incorporating new technologies, and working towards achieving the optimal level of accessibility. If you require assistance or have any feedback, please contact us at [contactEmail].
