## At the Zoo

The Zoo has seven different species of lemur in the lushly forested Lipman Family Lemur Forest.

On cooler days, look for the ring-tailed lemurs huddled together on the heated gray platforms. On a sunny day, you can often see the ring-tailed lemurs catching some rays from the sun in a yoga-like sitting position. They sit with their arms outstretched and heads back to maximize sun exposure.

## Available for Adoption!

An adoption of a ring-tailed lemur makes a great gift for friends, coworkers, family or for yourself!

## Fascinating Facts

  * Ring-tailed lemurs are among the best known, most easily recognized, and most intensively studied of all lemurs.
  * Ring-tailed lemurs spend more time on the ground – 15 percent! – than any of the other lemur species, commonly running on all fours.



## Physical Characteristics

Ring-tailed lemurs are a medium sized lemur, weighing between 5 – 8 pounds, with a head and body length of 14 to 17 inches, and a tail up to 21 inches in length. They have a fox–like muzzle, prominent ears, and dense fur. The back is usually reddish–brown with the rump and limbs a light gray or gray–brown, and a darker gray crown and neck. The underparts are white or cream, lightly haired, with dark skin showing beneath. The tail is ringed in black and white with a black tip. The forehead, cheeks, ears and throat are white and dark gray, and there are black rings around the eyes. Hind legs are long; the forelegs are short.

Lifespan is about 15 years in the wild, and up to 30 years under human care.

## Habitat/Diet

Ring-tailed lemurs come from south and southwestern Madagascar, although there is a small isolated population in the southeast plateau. They are found in a wide range of habitats including: brush and scrub forests, closed canopy deciduous forests, dry and rocky mountainous areas with patches of deciduous forests.

In the wild, ring-tailed lemurs primarily eat fruit, leaves, flowers, bark and sap. Occasionally, these lemurs will eat insects and small lizards as well. At the Zoo, they are fed a diet of fruit, vegetables and leafy greens.

## Social Behavior

Ring-tailed lemurs are social animals, living in mixed groups of 3 to 25 individuals, with a well-defined hierarchy. Females are dominant over males, and remain in the area where born, while males move between groups. They have well-defined, non-overlapping territories within their home ranges. Territorial encounters tend to consist of opposing groups of females running at each other and uttering a threatening call until one group retreats.

Fights among males range from a threatening stare, through lunging and cuffing, hair pulling and serious biting, to “stink fights” wherein males impregnate their tails with scent and then shake and quiver the tail over the head at their opponent.

Ring-tails are the only surviving semi-terrestrial diurnal lemur in Madagascar. They forage and travel at all levels in the forest, running along branches or leaping between them, with their powerful hind legs touching first.

Their vocalizations are reminiscent of purring cats, leading them to be sometimes referred to as “cat lemurs”. They also utilize shrill screams, bark-like cries as warnings and loud hooting calls at night before going to sleep. Ring-tailed lemurs also communicate through scent marking. Males have a specialized spur on their wrist that gives them the ability to impregnate trees with their scent.

Mating occurs from April to June with births in August to October. Since females are fertile for only a very short time, all the offspring in a group are born within a few days of one another. After a gestational period of 130 – 144 days usually one infant is born, but twins are not uncommon. Newborns are 4 inches in length with the adult coloration. The infant clings to its mother’s front and within three days of birth is moving around actively on its mother. By two weeks the infant is riding on her back and weaned by five or six months.

## Status In The Wild

Ring-tailed lemurs are listed as endangered by the IUCN and on appendix I of CITES. Habitat loss is a major threat for this species. The gallery forests that these lemurs prefer are being converted into land for farming, grazing and charcoal production. Additionally, they are hunted for food in part of their range as well as collected for the pet trade.

Fortunately, ring-tailed lemurs are found in several protected reserves throughout southern Madagascar and breed well in captivity.

The San Francisco Zoo participates in the Association of Zoo and Aquarium’s Prosimian Taxon Advisory Group and the Malagasy Fauna Interest Group.

San Francisco Zoo & Gardens Accessibility Statement

## Accessibility Statement

### Compliance status:

We strongly believe in the importance of making the Internet available and accessible to everyone. Therefore, we are dedicated to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of their circumstances or abilities.

To achieve this goal, we strive to adhere closely to the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1) at the AA level. These guidelines provide instructions on how to make web content accessible to people with various disabilities. By following these guidelines, we ensure that our website is accessible to individuals with visual impairments, motor impairments, cognitive disabilities, and more.

Our website incorporates technologies that enhance accessibility at all times. We utilize an accessibility interface that allows users with specific disabilities to customize the website's user interface (UI) according to their needs.

Additionally, our website employs an AI-based application that continuously optimizes its accessibility level. This application enhances the website's HTML and adjusts its functionality and behavior for screen-reader users and individuals with motor impairments.

If you come across any malfunctions or have suggestions for improvement, we welcome your feedback. Please contact the website's operators at the following email address: [contactEmail].

#### Screen reader and keyboard navigation:

Our website has implemented the ARIA attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) technique and other behavioral modifications to ensure that visitors using screen readers can effectively read, understand, and interact with the website. Upon entering the site, screen reader users are prompted to enter the Screen-Reader Profile, enabling them to browse and navigate the website seamlessly. Here are some important ways our website addresses screen reader requirements:

#### Screen-reader optimization:

We employ a background process that comprehensively learns the website's components, ensuring ongoing compliance even during updates. This process provides screen readers with meaningful data using ARIA attributes. For instance, we provide accurate form labels, descriptions for actionable icons (e.g., social media icons, search icons, cart icons), validation guidance for form inputs, and proper roles for elements like buttons, menus, and modal dialogues. Additionally, the background process scans all website images, generating accurate and meaningful descriptions using image-object-recognition-based ALT tags. It also extracts embedded text within images using optical character recognition (OCR) technology. Users can activate screen reader adjustments at any time by pressing the Alt+1 keyboard combination. Upon entering the website, screen reader users receive automatic announcements to enable the Screen-Reader mode.

#### Keyboard navigation optimization:

The background process enhances the website's HTML and adds JavaScript code to enable keyboard operability. This includes features such as navigating the website using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys, operating dropdown menus with arrow keys, closing them with Esc, triggering buttons and links using the Enter key, navigating between radio buttons and checkboxes with arrow keys, and filling them in with the Spacebar or Enter key. Keyboard users can access quick navigation and content-skip menus at any time by pressing Alt+1 or by finding them as the first elements while navigating using the keyboard. The background process also handles triggered popups by focusing the keyboard on them when they appear, preventing the focus from drifting outside.

Our adjustments are compatible with popular screen readers like JAWS and NVDA.

### Disability profiles supported on our website:

Our website provides various disability profiles to support individuals with specific accessibility needs:

  * Epilepsy Safe Mode: This profile eliminates the risk of seizures caused by flashing or blinking animations and risky color combinations.
  * Visually Impaired Mode: This mode adjusts the website to accommodate users with visual impairments such as Degrading Eyesight, Tunnel Vision, Cataracts, Glaucoma, and others.
  * Cognitive Disability Mode: This mode offers assistive options for users with cognitive impairments such as Dyslexia, Autism, CVA, and others, helping them focus on essential website elements.
  * ADHD-Friendly Mode: This mode assists users with ADHD and Neurodevelopmental disorders in reading, browsing, and maintaining focus on the main website elements while reducing distractions.
  * Blindness Mode: This mode ensures compatibility with screen readers such as JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and TalkBack, which are essential software for blind users.
  * Keyboard Navigation Profile (Motor-Impaired): This profile enables individuals with motor impairments to navigate the website using keyboard keys like Tab, Shift+Tab, and Enter. Users can also utilize shortcuts like "M" for menus, "H" for headings, "F" for forms, "B" for buttons, and "G" for graphics to jump to specific elements.



###   
Additional UI, design, and readability adjustments:

We offer several UI, design, and readability adjustments to enhance the user experience for all visitors:

  * Font adjustments: Users can modify the font size, family (type), spacing, alignment, line height, and more.
  * Color adjustments: Users can select different color contrast profiles (light, dark, inverted, monochrome) and swap color schemes for titles, texts, and backgrounds using over seven different coloring options.
  * Animations: Epileptic users can stop all animations, including videos, GIFs, and CSS flashing transitions, with a single click.
  * Content highlighting: Users can emphasize important elements such as links and titles or choose to highlight only focused or hovered elements.
  * Audio muting: Users with hearing devices can instantly mute the entire website to avoid headaches or other issues caused by automatic audio playback.
  * Cognitive disorders: We utilize a search engine linked to Wikipedia and Wiktionary, allowing users with cognitive disorders to decipher the meanings of phrases, initials, slang, and other content.
  * Additional functions: We provide users with options to change cursor color and size, activate a printing mode, enable a virtual keyboard, and access many other features.



###   
Browser and assistive technology compatibility:

We strive to support a wide range of browsers and assistive technologies, allowing users to choose the tools that best suit their needs. Our website has been extensively tested and works well on major systems, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera, and Microsoft Edge. We ensure compatibility with screen readers like JAWS and NVDA, both for Windows and MAC users.
