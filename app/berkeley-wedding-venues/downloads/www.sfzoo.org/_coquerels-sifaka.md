# Coquerel’s sifaka

![]()

_Propithecus coquereli_

## At the Zoo

You can find the sifaka in the sifaka habitat, an extension of the Lipman Family Lemur Forest, which includes a giant baobab tree climbing structure along with plants native to Madagascar.

## Fascinating Facts

  * The Malagasy name sifaka comes from the distinct “shif-auk” call these animals make when traveling through trees.
  * Sifaka have a unique upright posture and hop bi-pedally with arms outstretched when moving on the ground.
  * The lemur on the PBS Kids television program Zoboomafoo features a Coquerel’s sifaka.
  * They help maintain the health of forest ecosystems by dispersing seeds.
  * Sifaka can propel themselves a distance of 20-30 feet while moving from tree to tree.



## Physical Characteristics

Coquerel’s sifaka are easily recognizable medium-sized lemurs. They are mostly white on the head, body and tail with brown patches on the chest, arms and thighs. Their face is bare and black in color except for a small patch of white fur along the bridge of the nose. Ears, bottoms of the hands and feet are also black. Their large eyes are yellow.

Their long tail is used for balance when leaping from tree to tree. Sifaka have pseudo-opposable thumbs and an exceptionally long first toe that provides a strong grip on vertical tree trunks. Their long, powerful legs are an important adaptation for vertical leaping.

Sifaka, like other lemurs, have a grooming claw on the second toe of the hind foot and a dental comb formed from their lower incisors.

Lifespan is 25 – 30 years.

## Habitat/Diet

Coquerel’s sifaka are found in dry, deciduous and mixed forest in northwestern Madagascar. They have also been known to inhabit costal mangroves in the same region.

They are omnivores, primarily feeding on a variety of leaves, but will also eat fruit, flowers, seeds and bark.

## Social Behavior

Coquerel’s sifaka are diurnal and primarily arboreal; moving through trees by vertical clinging and leaping. They rely heavily on scent marking to define territories. Males mark using a gland near their throat while females use a gland near the tail.

They live in social groups of 3 – 10 individuals. Like many lemurs, this species of sifaka are matriarchal. Females have preferential access to food, choice of mates and make decisions about foraging locations. Females may also mate with more than one male, which is thought to help avoid infanticide.

Breeding is seasonal and, in the wild in the Southern Hemisphere, occurs in January or February. Young are born during the dry season, from June to July, after a gestation period of 162 days. In the Northern Hemisphere, breeding patterns may shift by six months. Infants will cling to its mother’s chest until about a month or so after birth, and then transfer to her back. Young are weaned independent at around 6 months of age. Upon reaching sexual maturity, at about 2 – 3.5 years, males leave their family group and join another.

## Status In The Wild

The Coquerel’s sifaka is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN and are protected under Appendix I of CITES. Habitat loss and fragmentation are major threats for this species; mostly due to slash and burn agriculture, deforestation for livestock farming, and charcoal production. Local traditions typically prevent the hunting of this species for food but it has recently become a threat, even in protected areas.

The San Francisco Zoo participates in the American Zoo and Aquarium Association’s Prosimian Taxon Advisory Group and the Malagasy Fauna Interest Group.

San Francisco Zoo & Gardens Accessibility Statement

## Accessibility Statement

### Compliance status:

We strongly believe in the importance of making the Internet available and accessible to everyone. Therefore, we are dedicated to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of their circumstances or abilities.

To achieve this goal, we strive to adhere closely to the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1) at the AA level. These guidelines provide instructions on how to make web content accessible to people with various disabilities. By following these guidelines, we ensure that our website is accessible to individuals with visual impairments, motor impairments, cognitive disabilities, and more.

Our website incorporates technologies that enhance accessibility at all times. We utilize an accessibility interface that allows users with specific disabilities to customize the website's user interface (UI) according to their needs.

Additionally, our website employs an AI-based application that continuously optimizes its accessibility level. This application enhances the website's HTML and adjusts its functionality and behavior for screen-reader users and individuals with motor impairments.

If you come across any malfunctions or have suggestions for improvement, we welcome your feedback. Please contact the website's operators at the following email address: [contactEmail].

#### Screen reader and keyboard navigation:

Our website has implemented the ARIA attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) technique and other behavioral modifications to ensure that visitors using screen readers can effectively read, understand, and interact with the website. Upon entering the site, screen reader users are prompted to enter the Screen-Reader Profile, enabling them to browse and navigate the website seamlessly. Here are some important ways our website addresses screen reader requirements:

#### Screen-reader optimization:

We employ a background process that comprehensively learns the website's components, ensuring ongoing compliance even during updates. This process provides screen readers with meaningful data using ARIA attributes. For instance, we provide accurate form labels, descriptions for actionable icons (e.g., social media icons, search icons, cart icons), validation guidance for form inputs, and proper roles for elements like buttons, menus, and modal dialogues. Additionally, the background process scans all website images, generating accurate and meaningful descriptions using image-object-recognition-based ALT tags. It also extracts embedded text within images using optical character recognition (OCR) technology. Users can activate screen reader adjustments at any time by pressing the Alt+1 keyboard combination. Upon entering the website, screen reader users receive automatic announcements to enable the Screen-Reader mode.

#### Keyboard navigation optimization:

The background process enhances the website's HTML and adds JavaScript code to enable keyboard operability. This includes features such as navigating the website using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys, operating dropdown menus with arrow keys, closing them with Esc, triggering buttons and links using the Enter key, navigating between radio buttons and checkboxes with arrow keys, and filling them in with the Spacebar or Enter key. Keyboard users can access quick navigation and content-skip menus at any time by pressing Alt+1 or by finding them as the first elements while navigating using the keyboard. The background process also handles triggered popups by focusing the keyboard on them when they appear, preventing the focus from drifting outside.

Our adjustments are compatible with popular screen readers like JAWS and NVDA.

### Disability profiles supported on our website:

Our website provides various disability profiles to support individuals with specific accessibility needs:

  * Epilepsy Safe Mode: This profile eliminates the risk of seizures caused by flashing or blinking animations and risky color combinations.

  * Cognitive Disability Mode: This mode offers assistive options for users with cognitive impairments such as Dyslexia, Autism, CVA, and others, helping them focus on essential website elements.
  * ADHD-Friendly Mode: This mode assists users with ADHD and Neurodevelopmental disorders in reading, browsing, and maintaining focus on the main website elements while reducing distractions.
  * Blindness Mode: This mode ensures compatibility with screen readers such as JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and TalkBack, which are essential software for blind users.
  * Keyboard Navigation Profile (Motor-Impaired): This profile enables individuals with motor impairments to navigate the website using keyboard keys like Tab, Shift+Tab, and Enter. Users can also utilize shortcuts like "M" for menus, "H" for headings, "F" for forms, "B" for buttons, and "G" for graphics to jump to specific elements.



###   
Additional UI, design, and readability adjustments:

We offer several UI, design, and readability adjustments to enhance the user experience for all visitors:

  * Font adjustments: Users can modify the font size, family (type), spacing, alignment, line height, and more.

  * Animations: Epileptic users can stop all animations, including videos, GIFs, and CSS flashing transitions, with a single click.
  * Content highlighting: Users can emphasize important elements such as links and titles or choose to highlight only focused or hovered elements.
  * Audio muting: Users with hearing devices can instantly mute the entire website to avoid headaches or other issues caused by automatic audio playback.
  * Cognitive disorders: We utilize a search engine linked to Wikipedia and Wiktionary, allowing users with cognitive disorders to decipher the meanings of phrases, initials, slang, and other content.
  * Additional functions: We provide users with options to change cursor color and size, activate a printing mode, enable a virtual keyboard, and access many other features.



###   
Browser and assistive technology compatibility:

We strive to support a wide range of browsers and assistive technologies, allowing users to choose the tools that best suit their needs. Our website has been extensively tested and works well on major systems, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera, and Microsoft Edge. We ensure compatibility with screen readers like JAWS and NVDA, both for Windows and MAC users.
