# Gift Giving and Forwarding Conservation

Nov 18, 2025

#### By Leticia Francis, Conservation Liaison

Every year I find myself wondering what to get my loved ones as the season of gift giving approaches. I’m sure I am not the only one. I would like to help, by giving some tips and ideas for finding gifts that have the potential to be memorable, exciting, engaging, and help to forward conservation!

Last year I challenged myself to only purchase things that did not take up space at their home, or if it did it would be able to be consumed. I was becoming overwhelmed by the number of items and trinkets I have collected over the years so I decided to try something new. Gifting experiences or consumables.

This year I looked into conservation organizations and bought some physical items from them, which help to forward their missions and the conservation work that they do.

## Conservation Organization Highlight

One such organization is CPALI! They are a great organization that do work with the community in mind, to help forward conservation through poverty alleviation in Madagascar. They use Wildlife Friendly silks and raffia to make their products that support local artisans in Madagascar and honor Malagasy culture. These products are wildlife friendly, fair trade, unique, and sure to start a conversation. CPALI promote biodiversity and native species. I personally have bought ornaments as gifts this year, and I cannot wait to give them out!

Check out the CPALI website [here](https://www.cpali.org/), and [this](https://www.cpali.org/blog) is a link to their own blog.  
Check them out on social media [@cpali_conservation](https://www.instagram.com/cpali_conservation/)

## Consumables highlights:

Bird friendly coffees are a great gift! It is fun to look through different coffees, and even to try some yourself! It’s also a great way to connect with people, and to spread conservation action. Bird friendly coffees help to promote biodiversity through shade grown coffee, which allows for the canopy cover to remain. Bird friendly coffee is also certified organic, and has to be 100% pure in which all beans in the bag meet standard for the certification. This means that less chemicals are used, which can negatively impact birds.

## Got a baker or chocolate lover in your life?

I also like to gift Madagascar friendly chocolate and vanilla.  
The brand Beyond Good brand is a great choice, and you can find them locally or buy them online.

## **Got a tea or Red Panda Lover in your life?**

![](https://www.sfzoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3-1024x512.png)

[Lake Missoula Tea Company](https://lakemissoulateacompany.com/product/panda-white/)has a tea in which the tea farm works directly with Red Panda Network, providing local jobs and easing pressures on red panda poaching. Bonus: look for their animal conservation bundle which has different teas which all help to forward animal conservation.

If you are looking for ideas you can also look at things to buy that are certified wildlife friendly. This is a certification that is not as well-known as Rainforest alliance, fair trade, or USDA Organic, but it is on the rise of being used by organizations that value conservation. You can look at some of the species being conserved, the partners that are conserving them, and the products that are certified on the Wildlife Friendly [website](https://www.wildlifefriendly.com/). CPALI is wildlife friendly certified due to their way of producing the silk, which does not harm the pupae, and allows for the pupae to emerge before processing.

  
You can also gift practical items that cut down on plastic use and production. One which can be a great introduction is [bees wax wrap](https://www.beeswrap.com/). It can be used in place of plastic wrap or even Ziplock bags.

There is also a way to gift experiences, which can be in the form of eco-tourism, or in other ways that promote biodiversity. You can gift national park entry for the year with a park pass, you can buy whale watching tours, or other experiences that connect people with nature. Just like you can help forward conservation through a membership or tickets purchased here at the zoo.

If there is a type of gift that you would purchase for someone you can look into or choose a product that is going to help forward conservation. Picking a wine? Why not search for a wine that gives money to conservation like the [Lion SAFE wine](https://winesthatrock.com/collections/wildlife-wine/products/wildlife-wines-african-lyon), or [painted dog conservation wines](https://www.paintedwolfwines.com/)? Getting a book for someone? Look into [books](https://therevelator.org/category/culture/reviews/) that discuss wildlife conservation. My hope here is to make suggestions that can be built upon, making choices for conservation in our everyday lives easier.

These are all ways and suggestions that are meant to make conservation action through being a conscientious consumer easier. It is a way to open up the dialogue on things that anyone can enjoy or incorporate into their lives. Conservation shouldn’t be something that is riddled with barriers out of reach from the average person. It is something that can be practiced and accessed by anyone and everyone.

The idea behind this blog is to create a space to make conservation more accessible, through sharing conservation stories from around the globe, conservation work being done at the zoo, experiences that our zoo staff take part in to forward conservation, and things that can be done to take conservation action.

P.S. If you or anyone you know has gotten new electronic gadgets this season, you can always bring them to the Zoo for recycling through our Gorillas on the Line program, drop off location in the Gift Shop or Membership Office 365 days a year. This program directly helps to fund gorilla conservation efforts through the Gorilla SAFE and Eco-Cell. Learn more about the program [here](http://eco-cell.com/conservation-partners/).

San Francisco Zoo & Gardens Accessibility Statement

## Accessibility Statement

### Compliance status:

We strongly believe in the importance of making the Internet available and accessible to everyone. Therefore, we are dedicated to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of their circumstances or abilities.

To achieve this goal, we strive to adhere closely to the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1) at the AA level. These guidelines provide instructions on how to make web content accessible to people with various disabilities. By following these guidelines, we ensure that our website is accessible to individuals with visual impairments, motor impairments, cognitive disabilities, and more.

Our website incorporates technologies that enhance accessibility at all times. We utilize an accessibility interface that allows users with specific disabilities to customize the website's user interface (UI) according to their needs.

Additionally, our website employs an AI-based application that continuously optimizes its accessibility level. This application enhances the website's HTML and adjusts its functionality and behavior for screen-reader users and individuals with motor impairments.

If you come across any malfunctions or have suggestions for improvement, we welcome your feedback. Please contact the website's operators at the following email address: [contactEmail].

#### Screen reader and keyboard navigation:

Our website has implemented the ARIA attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) technique and other behavioral modifications to ensure that visitors using screen readers can effectively read, understand, and interact with the website. Upon entering the site, screen reader users are prompted to enter the Screen-Reader Profile, enabling them to browse and navigate the website seamlessly. Here are some important ways our website addresses screen reader requirements:

#### Screen-reader optimization:

We employ a background process that comprehensively learns the website's components, ensuring ongoing compliance even during updates. This process provides screen readers with meaningful data using ARIA attributes. For instance, we provide accurate form labels, descriptions for actionable icons (e.g., social media icons, search icons, cart icons), validation guidance for form inputs, and proper roles for elements like buttons, menus, and modal dialogues. Additionally, the background process scans all website images, generating accurate and meaningful descriptions using image-object-recognition-based ALT tags. It also extracts embedded text within images using optical character recognition (OCR) technology. Users can activate screen reader adjustments at any time by pressing the Alt+1 keyboard combination. Upon entering the website, screen reader users receive automatic announcements to enable the Screen-Reader mode.

#### Keyboard navigation optimization:

The background process enhances the website's HTML and adds JavaScript code to enable keyboard operability. This includes features such as navigating the website using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys, operating dropdown menus with arrow keys, closing them with Esc, triggering buttons and links using the Enter key, navigating between radio buttons and checkboxes with arrow keys, and filling them in with the Spacebar or Enter key. Keyboard users can access quick navigation and content-skip menus at any time by pressing Alt+1 or by finding them as the first elements while navigating using the keyboard. The background process also handles triggered popups by focusing the keyboard on them when they appear, preventing the focus from drifting outside.

Our adjustments are compatible with popular screen readers like JAWS and NVDA.

### Disability profiles supported on our website:

Our website provides various disability profiles to support individuals with specific accessibility needs:

  * Epilepsy Safe Mode: This profile eliminates the risk of seizures caused by flashing or blinking animations and risky color combinations.
  * Visually Impaired Mode: This mode adjusts the website to accommodate users with visual impairments such as Degrading Eyesight, Tunnel Vision, Cataracts, Glaucoma, and others.
  * Cognitive Disability Mode: This mode offers assistive options for users with cognitive impairments such as Dyslexia, Autism, CVA, and others, helping them focus on essential website elements.
  * ADHD-Friendly Mode: This mode assists users with ADHD and Neurodevelopmental disorders in reading, browsing, and maintaining focus on the main website elements while reducing distractions.
  * Blindness Mode: This mode ensures compatibility with screen readers such as JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and TalkBack, which are essential software for blind users.
  * Keyboard Navigation Profile (Motor-Impaired): This profile enables individuals with motor impairments to navigate the website using keyboard keys like Tab, Shift+Tab, and Enter. Users can also utilize shortcuts like "M" for menus, "H" for headings, "F" for forms, "B" for buttons, and "G" for graphics to jump to specific elements.



###   
Additional UI, design, and readability adjustments:

We offer several UI, design, and readability adjustments to enhance the user experience for all visitors:

  * Font adjustments: Users can modify the font size, family (type), spacing, alignment, line height, and more.
  * Color adjustments: Users can select different color contrast profiles (light, dark, inverted, monochrome) and swap color schemes for titles, texts, and backgrounds using over seven different coloring options.
  * Animations: Epileptic users can stop all animations, including videos, GIFs, and CSS flashing transitions, with a single click.
  * Content highlighting: Users can emphasize important elements such as links and titles or choose to highlight only focused or hovered elements.
  * Audio muting: Users with hearing devices can instantly mute the entire website to avoid headaches or other issues caused by automatic audio playback.
  * Cognitive disorders: We utilize a search engine linked to Wikipedia and Wiktionary, allowing users with cognitive disorders to decipher the meanings of phrases, initials, slang, and other content.
  * Additional functions: We provide users with options to change cursor color and size, activate a printing mode, enable a virtual keyboard, and access many other features.



###   
Browser and assistive technology compatibility:

We strive to support a wide range of browsers and assistive technologies, allowing users to choose the tools that best suit their needs. Our website has been extensively tested and works well on major systems, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera, and Microsoft Edge. We ensure compatibility with screen readers like JAWS and NVDA, both for Windows and MAC users.

### Notes, comments, and feedback:

While we have made significant efforts to make our website accessible to everyone, there may still be pages or sections that are not fully accessible or lack adequate technological solutions. We are continuously improving our accessibility features, incorporating new technologies, and working towards achieving the optimal level of accessibility. If you require assistance or have any feedback, please contact us at [contactEmail].
