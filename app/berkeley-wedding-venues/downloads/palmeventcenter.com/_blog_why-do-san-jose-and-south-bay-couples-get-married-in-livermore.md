The answers are actually quite simple – for the area’s affordability, accessibility, and beautiful scenery.

**Wine Country Ambiance**

San Jose is known for its congestion and relatively urban nature. While the area does have scenic areas, Livermore Valley offers many more options when it comes to planning a wedding. Livermore Valley is mostly known as a wine region. San Jose does not offer much in terms of a wine country and therefore couples seeking this atmosphere must turn elsewhere.

**Budget-Friendly**

In comparing Livermore Valley with Napa Valley, it’s clear that Livermore comes up on top in terms of affordability. Livermore can also be much more budget-friendly than venues in the South Bay, dependent upon what type of wedding the couple wants. In addition, most venues in Livermore Valley were either built specifically for events or hold many events year-round. This gives them an edge in having the infrastructure for an elegant wedding.

**Accessibility**

The Livermore Valley area is also quite close and accessible for San Jose guests, but distinct from the South Bay. The area gives people a different vibe and allows the couple to choose if they would like a relaxed or fancy wedding. The venues themselves are quite flexible and allow for a variety of décor and options. Often San Jose venues are historical in nature or hotels, and thus limited in options.

**Weekend Getaways**

Livermore also offers stunning vistas, winery tasting options, and a weekend “wine theme” for guests to enjoy. It’s no wonder Livermore Valley Wine Country has become the weekend getaway for South Bay/San Jose couples looking to explore the greater Bay Area and do something a little different.
