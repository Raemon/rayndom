> This place is the most beautiful, picturesque wine valley country setting that gives Napa and Sonoma a run for its money... Chris, Facebook

> Palm Event Center was the best choice for a venue. This venue handles EVERYTHING with grace, professionalism, and to perfection. The grounds are gorgeous, the food is delicious, the drinks are delectable, and the event coordinators are insanely amazing at what they do.  Cady A., The Knot 

> Everything was so beautifully done – the décor, the space layout and design, the food, how seamlessly everything flowed – it was just wonderful. We all had the best time dancing the night away!!  Parissa & Andy 

> We just got married here two weeks ago and it exceeded all of our expectations. The venue was even more beautiful than we imagined. The Estate Room looked incredible, and our friends raved about the food...We also could not believe how much of a value we got for our money. Great food, an open bar, appetizers, a gorgeous venue. Palm was the perfect place for our venue.  Lauren, WeddingWire 

> The ambiance here is purely palatial or maybe “palazzo,” since the feeling you’ll get is that you’ve stepped into the Italian countryside. Set on a 110-acre winery estate and fashioned in size, scale and simplicity that emphasize the beauty and character of its vineyard setting, the Palm Event Center is certainly a magnificent place for a party.  Here Comes the Guide 

> Every guest loved the food, professionalism and attention to detail.  Heather Schmoll 

> You made yesterday flow smooth and took all the pressure off my shoulders.  Stephanie and Raul 

> You made everything look and feel PERFECT. You gave me the ability to enjoy my special day without stressing about the details.  Lenga & Ji-Eon Kim 

> I can’t say enough good things about the Palm Event Center. My husband and I got married there last month and I still can’t get over how perfect everything turned out. We looked at several (he would say a million) places while deciding on a venue and not one of them compared to how gorgeous this venue is. On top of that, from the bridal team to the staff on our wedding day, the service cannot be beat.  Madeline D., Yelp 

> We chose to get married at the Palm Event Center after checking out a variety of venues in the SF Bay Area. This was the best choice I made during the entire wedding process...The grounds are extremely well maintained and surrounded by the vineyards. There are so many great photo opportunities! In addition to all of this, the food was incredible!  Jennie S., The Knot 

> Your wedding will be great here, everyone was impressed. The food is good too! And the cost value was unbeatable in the Bay Area.  Private User, WeddingWire 

> The Palm is such a perfect beautiful wedding venue, with all the extras you offer and the things you take care of. As mother of the bride, I was never worried about anything not going as planned.  Paula Lutz 

> All I can say is “WOW.” My daughter’s wedding is a day she will always remember not only because she got married but because of the people that made a difference. Thank you, thank you, thank you! Xo  Nancy M., Yelp 

> Mr. Man and I have pretty high standards when it comes to service. We take pride in everything we do and that everyone should as well. The team at our venue was beyond perfect. They anticipated each of our needs, were on point with our event and you could tell they all loved their jobs. They took pride in it...not enough words to express my gratitude for the amazing team @palmeventcenter just another huge THANK YOU!  Thuy Vu, Instagram 

> It’s amazing how many people have said that this was the best wedding they have ever been to...From the bottom of our hearts, we want to thank you for a day that we will always remember.  Pedram and Ariana Talai 

> Truly high-class and always my first choice venue to recommend to clients in search of not only the wine country wedding, but the 5-star food and service as well!  Carolyn Wilson, Event Coordinator 

> I can’t even begin to thank you enough for how much you helped us on our wedding day. We seriously could not have made the day half as amazing without you. You BEYOND exceeded our expectations, thank you!!  Shannon and Austin 

> Dinner was Family-Style. Butter leaf salad with walnuts, raisins, and light dressing very fresh and tasty. Main course of short ribs were incredibly tender and generous – about the size of a fist for each person...Mashed potatoes were divine – so fluffy, smooth, and seasoned but not overly buttery. Everyone raved about the mash!  Daniel C., Yelp 

> Thank you for making this wedding such an amazing evening. Everything went soooo smoothly and without a hitch. We had many compliments that this was the most beautiful wedding they have been to. Also, several of the wedding party who have been in other weddings said this was the most well-organized wedding.  Randy and Gwen Frederick 

> You are all AMAZING and provided the BEST wedding reception, ever!!!  Maggie Dragon-Moss 

> I would recommend this venue to anyone, the place is gorgeous, the staff awesome and 100% professional. If I had to redo my entire wedding, I would have it here again and again!!  Parisa Homara, WeddingWire
