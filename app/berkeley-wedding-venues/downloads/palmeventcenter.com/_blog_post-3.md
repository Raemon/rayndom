It’s no secret that Livermore Valley Wine Country is one of the best places to hold a wedding. Read on for why couples have been flocking to this region to get married. (And also, why the [Palm Event Center](https://palmeventcenter.com/) and [Casa Real](https://casarealevents.com/) are the two best in the area!)

##### LOCATION

Conveniently located as a midway point in the Bay Area between the South Bay, North Bay, Central Valley, and San Francisco, Livermore is one of the most accessible regions for guests to travel for an event. Major highways lead directly to the wine region with highway 84 directly traveling through, connecting interstate 580 to interstate 680.

Both the Palm and Casa Real sit directly off highway 84, giving guests an easy travel time to the venues from most of the greater Bay Area. There are no confusing country roads or lack of directions from Google Maps.

##### OLDEST WINE REGION

While Napa and Sonoma may have more name recognition, the true wine enthusiasts know that Livermore is the first wine country region in California, and arguably the United States. The first commercial vines in the region were planted in the 1840’s, while Napa started their first commercial winery two decades later. Livermore also was the first American terroir to be recognized internationally with a Grande Prix win at the Paris International Exposition in 1889. Napa Valley would take almost 100 years to receive the same distinction. The region’s wines also consistently make it into the Wine Enthusiast, showing that Livermore wines haven’t lost their touch. The Palm’s next-door winery, Rubino Winery, consistently wins Double Gold Medals at the San Francisco International Wine Competition and scores above 90 points in Wine Enthusiast.

##### AFFORDABILITY & ACCESSIBILITY

Given Livermore’s rich history, Livermore has had a chance to relax into its identity. It’s unassuming and down-to-earth. People come to Livermore for a chance to experience real wine country living – affordable luxury while saying their vows.

In contrast, other well-known wedding regions, such as Napa and San Francisco, have become less hospitable in recent decades. Napa passed several laws increasingly making the region less welcoming to events, specifically weddings. Out of all the wineries that are in Napa, only 5 hold permits to host weddings. Due to this, hosting a wedding in Napa is often an expensive endeavor. Especially if a couple has a larger guest count. San Francisco is also more costly and was ranked as the second most expensive city in the United States to host a wedding, behind New York City (entrepreneur.com). This is due to often additional services needed, such as parking, union fees, and being a larger metropolitan market.

In holding a wedding in Livermore, couples are freer to choose amongst many venues to suit their needs without all the regulations. They also can still have an elegant wedding without all the costs and fees associated with an urban wedding.

##### ATTRACTIONS & RELAXATION

With over 40 wineries calling Livermore Valley their home, there is an abundance of wine-related activities in the area for guests. In addition, the area is home to many beautiful downtown areas, each with their own charm. Shopping and restaurants are thriving in each area, along with other more adventurous activities such as paintball, go-kart racing, horseback riding, hiking, golfing, and more. The area is truly the best of both worlds – enough nature for people wanting to get out and do something, and enough of the amenities for people looking to relax. Couples and guests find this area the perfect balance of both.

In recent years, especially after the COVID pandemic, couples are placing more value on the experience of celebrating with their loved ones, rather than just the wedding itself. Hosting a wedding in a diverse area allows couples the flexibility of planning multi-day activities to spend time with the people coming to see them.

##### THE VENUES

Livermore Valley wedding venues are just as well-known for hosting beautiful weddings as their counterparts in other regions.

In the case of the Palm Event Center in the Vineyard, the venue is a private estate with scenic views of the surrounding vineyards. Couples marrying have unrestricted access to the grounds for photos. The venue also has an open structure in its ceiling, allowing for any type of décor or lighting that can be imagined. This allows for endless options for couples to create their personalized wedding, while still having the ambiance of a wine country wedding. Other venues in the area offer similar scenic beauty and amenities.

If you haven’t already had the chance to look at venues in Livermore Valley Wine Country, take a little dive into them online. You will see that they offer all the perks described above – and may find yourself falling in love with one of them for your perfect wedding day.
