## Privacy Policy

In accordance with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) we must identify to you how we use your Personal Information.

In conducting our normal business operations, some of your information is shared with third parties (including but not limited to: answering your phone calls, responding to emails, and detailing your event). In order to perform these functions, Beets Hospitality Group collects personal information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked directly or indirectly with a particular consumer (“Personal Information”) within this Agreement and the services it provides to the Client, most often through the online portal available through the Beets Hospitality Group website.

  * Names

  * Internet Protocol address
  * Email address
  * Financial information (such as bank account numbers or debit/credit card numbers)
  * Signatures
  * Photographs
  * Customer preferences
  * Purchasing history



Beets Hospitality Group collects most of this Personal Information directly from the Client in person, by telephone, text, email, or via our website. However, Beets Hospitality Group may also collect information from publicly accessible sources, directly from a third-party (such as, but not limited to, a Vendor), from cookies on the Beets Hospitality Group website, and internal information technology systems. Beets Hospitality Group uses Personal Information for the following reasons: providing Client services under this Agreement, maintaining and/or serving Client accounts, and processing Client payments. We may share Personal Information with Vendors and other service providers contracted to help deliver products and services to Client, our affiliate entities (collectively referenced herein as Beets Hospitality Group), and other third parties used to help Beets Hospitality Group run its businesses (such as marketing and website service providers, and social media sites).

### Your Rights

Each Client has the right, under privacy and data protection laws as applicable, to exercise the following free of charge:

  * Disclosure of the Personal Information collected by Beets Hospitality Group, including: categories collected, categories of sources, the business and/or commercial purposes, the categories of third-parties, and specific pieces of Personal Information collected.
  * Disclosure of Personal Information used for a business purpose, including the categories (if any) disclosed to a third-party for a business purpose.
  * The Right to Deletion.
  * The Right to Opt-Out of the disclosure of Personal Information.
  * Protection against discrimination.



The third-parties where Personal Information is shared for a business purpose in assisting Beets Hospitality Group in serving the Client include:

  * 360 Payments Inc. (our credit card processor)
  * FileMaker Pro (our database purveyor)
  * Microsoft Outlook (our email program)
  * Lanlogic (our email servicer)



### Right to Deletion

Clients have the Right to Deletion. Subject to certain exceptions as set in this paragraph, on receipt of a verifiable request from the Client, Beets Hospitality Group will delete Personal Information from our records. The client is also encouraged to contact the third-parties above to exercise their Right to Deletion. However, Beets Hospitality Group will not delete Personal Information if it is necessary to:

  * Complete the transaction for which the Personal Information was collected.
  * Provide a good or service requested by Client or reasonably anticipated within the context of the ongoing business relationship with Client, or otherwise perform a contract between Beets Hospitality Group and Client.
  * Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for the activity.
  * Debug to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.
  * Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise his or her right of free speech, or exercise another right provided for by law.
  * Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act or any other local, state, or federal laws.
  * Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws when deletion of the information is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of such research, provided Beets Hospitality Group has obtained Client’s informed consent.
  * Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with Client expectations based on the business relationship between Beets Hospitality Group and Client.
  * Use Personal Information internally in a lawful manner that is compatible with the context in which Client provided the information.



### Right to Opt Out

Although we do not sell or share your Personal Information unless needed to run our business operations, we are required to inform you of your rights. The Client has the Right to Opt-Out of the disclosure of Personal Information, such as using images for social media and marketing activities. Beets Hospitality Group may disclose to a third-party Personal Information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked directly or indirectly with a particular consumer or household. Client has the right under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and certain other privacy and data protection laws as applicable to opt out of the sale or disclosure of his or her Personal Information. If Client opts out of the disclosure of his or her Personal Information, Beets Hospitality Group will refrain from selling or disclosing Client’s Personal Information unless Client subsequently provides express authorization to do so. However, such opt out may prevent Beets Hospitality Group from providing contracted services to Client. To exercise opt out rights, a Client must request so in writing or email us at [webmaster@beetshospitality.com](mailto:webmaster@beetshospitality.com).

### Right to Non-Discrimination

The Client has the Right to not be discriminated against by Beets Hospitality Group because the Client exercised any of his or her rights under privacy laws. This means that Beets Hospitality Group cannot:

  * Deny goods or services.
  * Charge different prices or rates for goods or services (including through the use of discounts or other benefits of imposing penalties).
  * Provide a different level of quality.
  * Suggest that the Client will receive a different price or rate or a different level of services unless such difference is reasonably related to the value provided to the Client by the Client’s Personal Information.



In addition to the provisions related to Client’s privacy rights herein, Client should review the Beets Hospitality Group website for additional privacy policies.
