# Why winter weddings are the best time of the year.

Winter is the coziest time of year. It’s a time of early evenings, twinkling lights, and families gathering. Thus, it’s natural to extend this season’s special magic to your wedding.

Read on to find out why winter weddings are the best.

**Cost**

Winter weddings are usually considered off-season. Couples can take advantage of lower costs while still booking the same services. This is not only true of wedding-related services, but also for your guests. Generally, they will have lower airfare and hotel stays during the winter months.

**Date & Vendor Availability**

As winter is generally considered off-season, this usually means less competition for booking venues and vendors. Therefore, it’s easier to book the vendors you want, for less cost!

**Photography Turn Around Time**

In the busy months photographer album turnaround times can be as long as three to four months. During the winter months when photographers have less to edit and shoot, they are much faster. This is a wonderful perk; especially when you just celebrated the most amazing day of your lives and want to re-live it and share with others.

**Romantic Atmosphere**

Winter equals romance. The days are shorter, thus couples can fully take advantage of a more romantic wedding atmosphere – using candles, twinkle lights, and fire pits to set an intimate mood. Warm beverages, hearty food, a decadent dessert (or two) all play into a cozy winter theme. 

**Décor Options**

While the rest of the year is generally associated with flowers, winter wedding décor can be less ornate, but just as beautiful, with dried branch centerpieces, candles, or other non-living arrangements. 

A well-kept secret for many years, couples are beginning to realize the benefits to having a wedding during this time of year. If you are looking for a venue with a Winter amenity package (twinkle lights around the property, outdoor heat lamps, fit pits, and lounge seating), contact us at the [Palm Event Center](http://www.palmeventcenter.com)!
