We love weddings!

# Is the Palm Event Center accepting of all weddings (gay, straight, non-binary, etc.)?

The [Palm Event Center in the Vineyard](https://palmeventcenter.com/) is absolutely accepting of LGBTQ+ weddings and people. People are people, love is love, and kindness is kindness. No one should feel discriminated against or made to feel like they do not deserve the best day in their lives due to how they identify.

We welcome everyone and assure you that our staff is accepting as well. We find it unfortunate that many couples come to us with potential concerns over the treatment of their guests or themselves. We want to assure those with these questions that you will be in an accepting environment and made to feel like the special couple that you are.

Some of the ways we have tried to make our venue friendlier to the LGBTQ+ community are:

  * We have tried to eliminate specific pronouns or titles in our literature. Gone are “bride,” “groom,” “bridal party,” “groomsmen,” etc. We want everyone to feel welcome at our venues, regardless of their role or how they describe themselves.
  * Similarly, we have tried to create planning materials that assist couples with planning their wedding in a non-gendered way.
  * We welcome staff from all backgrounds, knowing that they assist us with making up a prismatic view of our couples. We want people who are understanding and sympathetic toward others, lending their voice to how we can do better.
  * We have initiated training in some areas to better assist staff with diverse clientele. This is an area that we are just beginning, and we are further investing in.
  * We encourage customization! LGBTQ+ weddings can often suffer from not being mainstream and thus it’s sometimes difficult to come up with the correct terminology, “best practices,” and practical resources. This can leave many couples in a grey area unless they know exactly what they want. We aim to assist in getting to the core of what you are both looking for in your wedding and how to logistically assist that during the day’s events.
  * We are honored when couples choose to marry at our venue. It’s a privilege to be included in something so private and celebratory. We hope that everyone who walks through our doors feel attended to, acknowledged, and special. Perhaps most importantly, we want the wedding planning process to be fun and relaxed, no matter who you love.
