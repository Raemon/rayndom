**1\. The Palm Event Center was built for weddings.**

The venue was architecturally designed to host events. The spaces and grounds of the venue have been designed to create seamless events, naturally allowing guests to flow in and out of spaces. The Palm Event Center is also exclusively dedicated to hosting events. Without the distractions of a hotel or restaurant, the focus is entirely on creating your perfect day.

**2\. Newly remodeled as a contemporary winery estate.**

Recently refreshed, the Palm feels like an elegant, modern winery. The ballroom intentionally is a light and airy neutral palette in order to highlight any wedding decor, centerpieces, and flowers.

**3\. Private winery estate atmosphere.**

For couples looking for a private venue, the Palm is the ultimate wedding destination. Marrying couples have exclusive access to the property and grounds during their wedding. 

**4\. The food.**

The Palm Event Center’s founder was trained at the Culinary Institute of America. Food is at the heart of the company. Our culinary team creates fine-dining experiences for couples and guests.

**5\. Inclusive packages offering flexibility.**

Our packages include everything needed For couples who want inclusions to host their reception, but still want the flexibility of booking other services outside of the venue, the Palm is ideal. We offer wedding packages that include menus, bar service, day-of coordination, meal service, planning tools, and all the equipment needed for hosting a meal (table, Chiavari chairs, linens, place settings, etc.). Services such as photography, videography, DJs, bands, officiants, ceremony rentals, etc. are open to any professional vendor to work at our venue. Couples also have the option to add extras to their package for a unique event.

**6\. Enough space for larger guest counts.**

We are able to hold some of the largest guest counts in the area. In addition, we have experience with large multicultural events, such as Indian. Our venue and grounds has space for all of the traditional events (baraats, milinis, flame ceremonies, and receptions). 

**7\. Coordination Service is included!**

Unlike most venues, our coordination service is included with our wedding package. Your coordinator will assist you with the wedding planning, create a day-of timeline and floor diagram, run your rehearsal and ensure your wedding flows seamlessly during your ceremony and reception. Our coordinators know our property inside and out and have years of experience planning weddings.

**8\. Our planning tools and process.**

In addition to our coordination service, we include a bunch of extra tools in booking with our property. Couples gain access to an online wedding planning platform that includes helpful documents, vendor information, and a payment portal. This helps couples stay on-track with their planning while doing it in a convenient way.

**9\. Fun enhancements!**

In addition to our wedding package menu, we allow couples to add fun food and beverage extras if they wish. The options are meant to be beautifully designed and add an element of interest at a wedding. Some of these options include donut flambé, mini desserts, ramen, fry bar, and boba cart. Our goal is to make your wedding feel unique and personal to YOU.

**10\. The people.**

We’ve searched far and wide for a talented group of friendly professionals who love weddings and hospitality. We thrive on making couples and their guests happy. Read our reviews and see how many couples rave about our staff – they are the foundation of everything we do.
