#### Estate Room

Intimate with glittering tea lights and rows of oak wine barrels, the Estate Room is full of wine cave romance. Two massive handcrafted redwood doors create a dramatic entrance, opening to reveal a stunning aisle with overhead glowing wrought-iron chandeliers. Wine barrels line the room with optional uplights placed between barrels that give the room a glowing, striking atmosphere. A perfect room for indoor ceremonies, small wedding receptions, or cocktails. It may also be used for fun activities, such as a speakeasy lounge or kids room.

#### Ballroom

Light, airy and contemporary, the Palm's ballroom features ample natural light and giant window doors opening up to the vineyards beyond. Wine barrels accent the room's interior while sconces, candles and uplights create a warm glow. The candle feature wall is the perfect backdrop for a sweetheart or head table. An impressive sleek quartz and metal bar is located in one corner of the room, featuring a full open bar with spirits, beer, wine and custom cocktails.

#### Vineyard Terrace

Overlooking 110 acres of vineyards, the Palm's outdoor Terrace allows guests to thoroughly enjoy scenic wine country. Accessed from the Ballroom through five sets of contemporary window doors, the outdoor space features a multilevel stone patio for guests to mingle, sip cocktails, and play lawn games. There is also a beautiful wooden arbor and lawn area for outdoor ceremonies that overlooks the vineyards. A winding path to the ceremony site allows guests and the wedding party to make a grand entrance.
