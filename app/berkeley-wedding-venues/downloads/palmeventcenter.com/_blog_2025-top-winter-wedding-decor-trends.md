Who says that winter weddings must adhere to subdued tones? Defy expectations with a bold and bright color scheme. Use pinks, reds, purples, greens, and oranges to bring out an unexpected winter theme. Guests will appreciate it as a break from all the holiday decor of the season. Add literal light to your theme by having a neon sign as a head table or photo booth backdrop. Pair a neon sign with our uplights and outdoor twinkle lights for a playful and modern wedding.

**WHIMSICAL WINTER WONDERLAND**

Elevate the winter theme with unexpected twists – think of lighting elements that resemble icicles or falling snow. These kinds of lighting elements will add an immersive, festive feeling to your wedding. Play up the winter theme of snow and ice with a custom ice sculpture near the bar or use it as a decor item for a food element.

**HYGGE COZY**

The hygge lifestyle is all about taking time away from the daily rush to be together with people you care about by relaxing and enjoying life’s quiet pleasures. Bring that sense of togetherness and coziness to your wedding by incorporating little touches of hygge into your decor. Use blankets as accents that guests can actually use during the ceremony or at a lounge. Table decor can be simple and tasteful, reminding guests of the winter season. Use a pinecone for a place card. A few floating candles as as a centerpiece. Some seasonal greenery and fake white fur or a chunky knit blanket to complete the look. Books, board games, and other quiet activities can be used as decor as well. 

**WINTER WHITE ELEGANCE**
