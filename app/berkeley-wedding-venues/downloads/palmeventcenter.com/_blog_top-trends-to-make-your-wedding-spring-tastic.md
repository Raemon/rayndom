Spring brings fresh and vibrant wedding trends that perfectly blend modern color schemes with the timeless charm of the season. As nature begins to bloom, so does the creativity in wedding planning. Read on in how to incorporate the latest trends with a spring theme into your ceremony and reception.

**EMBRACING NATURE**

Spring’s signature is its bloom and spring weddings are all about floral abundance. Combine this with the trend of wildflower-inspired florals and color palettes and this is the hot new trend. Cool blues, vibrant greens, and muted salmons are the “it” colors. In addition, many couples still are choosing traditional pastels with muted lilacs, mints, yellows, and tangerines. These natural elements are not just limited to decor, but extend to floral prints in attire and even the wedding cake design.

**LIGHT FABRICS**

Reflecting the lightness of spring, fabrics are also going light and airy for spring weddings. Chiffon and organza are being used in everything from wedding party and guest attire, to table linens, napkins, and drapery. These fabrics not only enhance the seasonal feel but also contribute to the ethereal aesthetic of the wedding.

**OUTDOOR ELEGANCE**

Outdoor ceremonies harness the beauty of spring. Spring ceremonies and receptions are embracing garden party themes, in addition to a wildflower look.

**SEASONAL MENUS AND FRESHNESS**

Tailoring your menu to spring is also a must. Fresh salads featuring strawberries or apples, cocktail hour fare such as ramen for the in-between weather, and salmon or cod for an entree all give off a cozy, but lighter menu vibe. Mini desserts featuring fresh fruit and dainty flavors are also popular.
