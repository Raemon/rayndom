##### **LOCATION**

A lot of San Francisco couples are surprised to learn that Livermore is closer than Napa Valley. It’s also much more accessible with major freeways leading to it. Weekend traffic out of the city is usually around 45 minutes to an hour. Livermore Valley is also closer to major airports and more ideally central to the Greater Bay Area.

##### **WEATHER**

If you live in San Francisco, you know the area can be quite cold and foggy. Livermore generally has temperate days and warm evenings, meaning outdoor ceremonies are a possibility year-round and guests usually are quite comfortable.

##### **COST**

Cost can be a big factor in San Francisco. In a top tier destination market venues can be quite pricey. Couples often find that for the same amount of money they can get a wedding for more guests in Livermore or be able to include more things on their wish list.

##### **QUALITY OF VENDORS**

Livermore is home to many talented wedding vendors. This is especially due to the region being a hot spot of weddings. In addition to having high-quality wedding vendors in the area, Livermore Valley is also very close to all of the Bay Area, making it easy for vendors to travel to the region.

##### **ACCOMMODATIONS**

Located amongst a major region of commerce and recreation, Livermore Valley Wine Country, and the surrounding Tri-Valley, have ample options for hotels. From quaint boutique hotels, such as the [Rose Hotel ](http://www.rosehotel.net "Rose Hotel ")and the [Purple Orchid Inn](https://www.purpleorchid.com/ "Purple Orchid Inn"), to more modern accommodations, such as the [Pleasanton Marriott](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/oakmc-pleasanton-marriott/overview/ "Pleasanton Marriott") or [AC Hotel](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/oakac-ac-hotel-pleasanton/overview/ "AC Hotel"), there is a diverse variety of places to stay.
