# Ways to incorporate your pets into your wedding.

Pets are often a couple’s first family. It’s natural to want to include them as important family members in your wedding. While many wedding venues won’t let you have your pet there for the entire wedding due to health regulations, there are simple ways you can include your furry friend.

##### GUEST BOOKS

Creative guest books are a unique way to incorporate a pet. Watercolor paintings, drawings, or photos of the couple and their pet where guests can sign around the image become family mementos.

##### FIRST LOOK

Some couples choose to have a First Look prior to the ceremony. This allows for extra photo time. First looks that are not just the couple have become very popular. This can be father and daughter, mother and son, bride/groom and child/ren, and pets!

##### CEREMONY

Most venues will allow your dog to be present for your ceremony. This is especially true if your ceremony is outdoors. Have your pet be the ring bearer. Or for older animals that aren’t as mobile, have a wedding party member chauffer them in a wagon or their arms.

##### MATCHING OUTFITS

While most dogs don’t like to be dressed up, many will tolerate a coordinating item with your wedding color scheme. Bandanas, bowties, and floral collars all work well. If your dog is especially tolerant, they can don a suit or dress.

##### BAR

This is a huge trend. Couples name their signature drinks after their pets. They include the pets on their bar signage. And, they even print their likeness on bar napkins. It’s one of the easiest ways to show love for your furry family.

##### COUPLE PHOTOS

In addition to the First Look, often couples will take photos just after the ceremony has ended (during cocktail hour). If a pet is onsite for the ceremony, they can join in on the photos as well.
