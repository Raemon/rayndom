  1. We heart [Here Comes The Guide](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/). The ladies there are all knowledgeable, ethical, and really know their stuff. Browse their website for vendors (it’s more than just venues) and wedding planning tips.
  2. Local tourist organizations, such as a Convention Visitors Bureau. Visit Tri-Valley in the Livermore Valley is a rich resource for couples. They cover everything from venues, to hotels, to things to do. Often, they know about deals and are paid to help visitors like you and your wedding guests coming into an area – free of charge for you!
  3. Blogs. Blogs are the new wedding magazines and they allow you to see new styles, trends, and develop your own ideas for your wedding. We love Style Me Pretty, Green Wedding Shoes, Stationers, Carats & Cake, Maharani Weddings, MunaLuchi Bride, The Perfect Palette, and Equally Wed.
  4. Your wedding planner (and other vendors). Vendors whom you have hired, and trust, often give the best advice. They know the local market and are experienced in weddings. You’ve already hired them – ask them questions!
  5. Reddit. Believe it or not, Reddit can actually be a great way to anonymously ask people about their experiences. It’s a written format, which allows people to be more detailed about their answers. Just, as always, take what people say with a grain of salt. Differences in cultures, regions, and families can sometimes make their advice not as helpful.
