# Frequently Asked questions

____ How much does a wedding at Belle Vie Vinyard Cost?

Costs can vary based on a number of factors. We try to make it as easy as possible to budget and plan with our all-inclusive packages and we are flexible. Our “out the door” pricing will only change as you add guests or add/remove services. Prices may vary during the off season (November – March) with seasonal specials.

____ Can I bring my own caterer?

Yes! Belle Vie Vineyard is excited to announce that we are now open to outside catering. All food service providers must be pre-approved and agree to our outside caterer guidelines. 

“Full Service” catering is required at Belle Vie and caterers on our approved vendor list are ready to serve you! Additional caterers not on our approved list may be considered and will incur a $500 kitchen rental fee. 

See catering requirements and guidelines here

____ Can we bring our own alcohol?

No. Belle Vie Vineyard is fully licensed to serve beer, wine and liquor. We therefore cannot allow outside alcohol but we do offer options to build a bar package that fits your budget and taste.

____ Can we have live music?

Yes please! We love live music and we have the perfect rural setting to accommodate it. 

We do require that all bands carry liability insurance. 

There is an additional $500 venue fee for live bands to provide the necessary overtime for breakdown. This fee may be waived for acoustic style performers.

____ Do I need a Day Of Coordinator

Yes. Belle Vie requires that all weddings have a professional Day Of coordinator. We are happy to add our top pick to your package so that you can be sure your day is stress free and exactly as you envisioned. Our coordination team are Certified Wedding Planners and familiar with every inch of our property and its rules. This choice is provide you with an easy, no confusion experience. 

We do understand that there’s a very personal relationship between you and your planner so we welcome any coordinator that fits you and your day provided that they are properly insured.

____ Can I bring my own vendors?

Of course! With the exception of beverages. We welcome the chance to work with your favorites and trust that you’ll make the choice that’s right for you. Most vendors will be required to provide liability insurance if setting up, breaking down or staying on property during your event.

____ Do you offer more services than what's in the package?

Absolutely! If you want referrals, we’ve got them! We work with some of the best in the industry. If you’re more of a hands-off couple, we are happy to facilitate a few of these services for you and add it to your invoice. We have access to special discounts with our day of coordination services, DJ and specialty rentals and are happy to pass those on to you! Tell us what you need and how we can help.

____ Will you hold my date?

Unfortunately we can’t. Your date is only secured once you sign the contract and pay the date reservation fee. This will be calculated at 25% of the total package price. The most popular dates fill up one to two years in advance so, if you want my advice, if you want the date .. book it!

____ Are there any extra fees?

Yes and no!

Yes – All packages are subject to sales tax and an 18% service fee.

No – Because aside from that, we don’t like to nickel and dime our couples. We don’t charge ceremony site fees, cake cutting fees, corkage fees, fees for bringing outside vendors, etc!

____ How long can my event be?

Your package includes 6 hours of event time. Additional hours can be purchased and all events must end by 12:00 am unless prior arrangements have been made.

____ How early can we arrive and how early do we have to leave?

Your package includes 3 hours of time for setup prior to your event start time. This allows ample time for all your vendors to get their pieces in place. There is also 1 hour for clean-up after the event ends. This means all vendors and personal belongings must be off the property in this allotted time to avoid overtime charges.

____ Is the property handicapped accessible?

Belle Vie is fully ADA compliant and Certified. We do have handicapped parking and front door drop off is available with management approval.

____ Is there a curfew?

Noise ordinance requires that all amplified music outdoors cease by 11pm. There is no curfew for indoor music however keep in mind that our liquor license requires that bar service ends by 12:00 am.

____ Is there a guest minimum?

Our packages are based on 100 guests and this is the minimum for Saturday events. We can adjust our package price for Friday or Sunday weddings with a minimum of 50 guests. Check out our micro-wedding packages if you’re looking for more options!
