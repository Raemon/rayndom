# Sold Out: Spring Bird Walk

## April 30, 2025 @ 9:00 am \- 10:30 am

$20 – $25

This walk is full. Please email gardenprograms@berkeley.edu to be added to our notification list to be informed of openings. Thank you for your interest!

Join Chris Carmichael in search of both resident and migrant birds in the Garden’s many bird friendly micro habitats. Chris will be joined by Susan Greef, Garden Member and avid birder. Beginning and experienced bird watchers are welcome. Limited to 15 participants.

This walk follows uneven terrain, with areas of paved and unpaved trail. For accessibility inquiries, please email [gardenprograms@berkeley.edu](mailto:gardenprograms@berkeley.edu).

We suggest bringing binoculars if you have them. Wear layers in case it is a chilly morning. **Walk is rain or shine** , though heavy rain cancels.

(Pictured is a rarely seen Red-naped-Sapsucker at the Botanical Garden in 2024!)

Fee: $25/$20 Member
