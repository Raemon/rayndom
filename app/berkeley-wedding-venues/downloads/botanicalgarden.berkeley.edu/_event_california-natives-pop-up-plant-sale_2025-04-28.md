# California Natives Pop-Up Plant Sale

## April 28, 2025 @ 10:30 am \- 4:30 pm

Free

Rain, 80 degree days, wildflowers blooming, leaves budding out — it’s spring in California! Join us in celebrating the plants of the California Floristic Province, our best pollinators and habitat plants. We’ll have a range for year-round color, sunny inland areas, coastal fog, and more.

The Garden’s volunteer propagators and staff will be on-hand to answer questions and provide advice on caring for your new houseplants.

Free, no admission required.
