# May Butterfly Walk

## May 14, 2025 @ 2:00 pm \- 3:00 pm

$14 – $18

The UC Botanical Garden is home to an every changing array of butterflies. Join our docent butterfly specialist Sally Levinson and Andy Liu for a guided walk through the Garden in search of butterflies, as you learn about their plant relationships and amazing life cycle. Bring binoculars if you have them.

Registered children welcome. Pre-registration is required, space is limited. Groups larger than 6 people, please contact us to make separate arrangements for a private tour.

This walk follows uneven terrain, with areas of paved and unpaved trail. For accessibility inquiries, please email gardenprograms@berkeley.edu, or call 510-664-7606.

All program fees include same-day admission to the Garden, rain or shine.
