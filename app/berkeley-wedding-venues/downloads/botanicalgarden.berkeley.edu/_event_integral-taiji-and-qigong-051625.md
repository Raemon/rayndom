# Integral Taiji and Qigong

## May 16, 2025 @ 11:00 am \- 12:00 pm

Free

Join us for a the Integral Taiji & Qigong class. This class focuses on embodied, psycho-spiritual, ecological, and cosmological dimensions of qigong and taiji (tai chi). We will practice standing meditation, walking meditation, the Microcosmic Orbit, Taiji Ruler, the Eight Treasures, cleansing the internal organs, embodying the elements, and more.

Everyone is invited to participate, regardless of prior experience. Children are welcome if accompanied by an adult (with Garden admission). Please wear comfortable clothes and shoes, and bring layers for warmth and sun-protection.

Class will be held outdoors. Please let us know if you have accessibility questions. **While we plan to hold this event outdoors, weather may require us to move indoors**. Per UC policy, masks are optional indoors.

**Elizabeth McAnally, PhD** is the author of Loving Water across Religions: Contributions to an Integral Water Ethic (Orbis Press, 2019). She works as the newsletter editor and website manager for the Yale Forum on Religion and Ecology. She practices yoga and Chinese internal arts (taiji, qigong, bagua, xingyi, and yiquan) and teaches Integral Taiji & Qigong classes in Berkeley and online.
