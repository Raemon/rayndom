# Zoom Talk: Botanizing in Sumatra

## May 7, 2025 @ 12:00 pm \- 1:00 pm

Free

**Take a virtual trip to the biodiversity hot-spot of Sumatra** at this lunchtime Zoom talk with UCBG Horticulturists Eric Hupperts and Corina Rieder. They will share with you photos of their journey to see plants growing wild in their native habitat, some of which are represented in the Botanical Garden collections, while others can only be seen in Sumatra. This travelogue will have you appreciate the extreme nature of botanizing in this tropical region, see amazing photos of plants and animals, all while shining a light on how trips like this inform their work in the Asia, Tropical House and other glasshouse collections at the UC Botanical Garden.

Program is free, donations welcome, registration required for Zoom link.

**NOTE:** All participants are required to have and sign into their own Zoom account prior to joining meetings hosted by UC Berkeley.
