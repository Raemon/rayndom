# Carnivorous Plant Pop-Up Sale

## May 23, 2025 @ 10:30 am \- 4:30 pm

_ _ Event Series  [ (See All)  ](https://botanicalgarden.berkeley.edu/series/carnivorous-plant-pop-up-sale/)

Free

Flowers, pitchers, traps, sticky leaves–it’s our spring Carnivorous Plant sale! Quantities are limited so shop early for best selection. All plants are grown here at the Botanical Garden.

Selected straight  _Sarracenia_ species are a ‘must have’ for collectors who want to make their own  _Sarracenia_ crosses. We have representatives of all the major species (_S. leucophylla_ ,  _S. flava_ ,  _S. minor_ ,  _S. alata_ ,  _S. purpurea_) as well as those which are rare in the wild and seldom seen in the trade—  _S_.  _alabamensis_ ,  _S. oreophila_ ,  _S. rubra_ (ssp.  _wheryii_ and ssp. jonesii), and  _S. psittacina_. All plants have established rhizomes in 4″ pots.

_Sarracenia_ hybrids include over 50 varieties of known parentage (see plant list) and a large selection of hybrids of unknown parentage. Established rhizomes in 4″ pots and seed grown crosses in 2″ pots.

We will also have a selection of  _Pinguicula_ ,  _Drosera_ ,  _Nepenthes_ , and limited quantities of  _Darlingtonia_.

The Garden’s volunteer propagators and staff will be on-hand to answer questions and provide advice on caring for your new plants.

  * **Members receive their regular 10% discount on plant purchases**
  * Bring a box or bag to take home your purchases



**No admission fee required to shop**

Sale runs through Monday, May 26
