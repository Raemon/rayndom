# Sold Out: Members Only Walking Tour of the Asia Collection

## May 12, 2025 @ 1:00 pm \- 2:30 pm

$10

Join Horticulturist Eric Hupperts for a behind-the-scenes walking tour to explore what is happening in the Asia collection. We’ll wander the trails, soak in the spring rhododendron blooms and visit the Japanese Pool and the Bamboo Grove.

We will begin with tea and introductions before heading into the Garden.

Refunds will be offered for up to two weeks ahead of the event but due to capacity limits (only 15 spaces will be available). No refunds after Friday, April 25th.

Heavy rain will cancel this event but you will be notified by 10:00 am the day of the event. In case of a rain cancellation a full refund will be applied.

Not a member, and want to attend? Join today!

Cost: $10
