##  CATERING TO GO

**FROM OUR HOUSE TO YOUR HOUSE**

Bring home the magic of Chart House to your table and work the party, not the kitchen. Our catering to go is perfect from groups from 10 - 100. To ensure maximum flavor & freshness, our platters are not pre-made. Most selections can be ready for pick-up within 2 hours. 

All catering includes plates, napkins, flatware & serving utensils. Ask your sales person about whole dessert options to complete your experience.
