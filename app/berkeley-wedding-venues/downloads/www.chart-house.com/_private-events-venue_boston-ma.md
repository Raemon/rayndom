##  PRIVATE EVENTS

We are happy to assist you with all the details of your business function, wedding reception, rehearsal dinner, birthday celebration, anniversary party or other special event. Guests will enjoy the freshest seafood, succulent steaks and impeccable service that only Chart House can provide.

Thank you for considering the Boston Chart House as your venue for your special event. We hope to work with you in making it memorable for all the right reasons! The four-story Gardiner Building, which now houses the Chart House, was built around 1763 and served as office to Thomas Hancock and, subsequently, his nephew John Hancock. Often referred to as “Hancock’s Counting House,” it is the oldest building on Long Wharf. The Boston Chart House, which opened in July 1973, continues to maintain this ideal. Guests will note many original fixtures such as Hancock’s safe, broad wooden beams, floors, staircase, and red brick walls.

Sitting along the docks on historical Long Wharf makes the Boston Chart House Restaurant the perfect location to host any type of event, offering the finest and freshest seafood to the highest quality steaks. Let our professional staff make it an unforgettable occasion that will create memories to last a lifetime.
