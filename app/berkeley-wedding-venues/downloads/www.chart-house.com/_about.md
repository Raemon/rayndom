The Chart House concept was born on Independence Day in 1961, the brainchild of famed Hawaiian surfer Joey Cabell and U.S. Navy man Buzzy Bent. The first location was modest, with just a few tables in a converted diner. However, two principles present in 1961 remain staples of every Chart House location – great food and equally impressive views. Today, Chart House restaurants overlook the coasts of both the Atlantic and the Pacific, and other scenic locations in between. And while we stretch from sea to shining sea, every location remains committed and specialized to its local community.

Chart House dominated the Open Table list of the 100 restaurants with the most scenic views, accounting for 10 of the 100 multiple years in a row.
