## Company Holiday Party Checklist

Planning a company holiday party requires balancing logistics, team preferences, and inclusivity to create a meaningful and enjoyable event. To help ensure no detail is overlooked, here’s a checklist of essential considerations.

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/credit-card-icon.svg)

##### Budget

Consider all possible expenses (venue, food, entertainment) and leave some room for unexpected costs. Knowing what you're working with helps make decisions that fit your goals without overspending.

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/clock-icon.svg)

##### Timing and Length of Event

Decide whether the party will be held during office hours or after work, and how long it should last. The timing can impact attendance, so aim for a slot that accommodates as many team members as possible.

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/verified-icon.svg)

##### Cultural and Religious Sensitivity

Opt for a theme that’s broadly inclusive to honor various traditions. Being mindful of religious observances can help everyone feel comfortable and included in the celebration.

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/fork-and-knife-icon.svg)

##### Venue and Space Requirements

Select a space that suits your group size and event style. If hosting onsite, ensure there’s enough room for activities, or consider offsite venues with convenient access and parking.

##### Accessibility and Transportation Options

If offsite, consider access to public transportation or provide shuttles if needed. Ensuring an easy commute for everyone can make attendance more convenient.

##### Consideration for Team Dynamics

Take into account the diverse personalities and comfort levels within the group. A relaxed, flexible event plan can make the gathering enjoyable for everyone, even those who may not be drawn to large social gatherings.

##### Holiday Toasts and Speeches

Make sure to set aside time for holiday toasts and words of appreciation for the group. Acknowledging the team’s hard work and contributions can make the event feel more meaningful and connected.

## **Types of**Corporate Holiday Events** **

Holiday events can take many forms, each with its unique advantages for bringing colleagues together. Here’s a breakdown of different types of employee holiday party formats, suited for various team setups and preferences. 

### Offsite Company Holiday Party

An offsite holiday party takes your team out of the office to enjoy a festive environment at a restaurant, bar, or event venue. Whether you’re hosting a formal dinner or a more casual gathering, an offsite party allows employees to unwind in a fresh space, helping them feel appreciated. This style is ideal for a staff holiday party or a department holiday party, especially when aiming for a more elaborate celebration.

#### Onsite or Office Holiday Party

An onsite or office holiday party can be an excellent way to bring holiday cheer directly to the workplace. Many companies choose to cater an employee holiday luncheon or host a more casual employee holiday lunch with holiday decor, music, and perhaps even a visit from Santa! This is a great option for a staff xmas party where you can bring in entertainment or host activities like gift exchanges and games, all within the comfort of your own office.

#### Holiday Party for Remote Team

### 

For remote teams, holiday celebrations require a virtual setup, but they can still be engaging and interactive. Host a virtual game night, an online cocktail-making class, or a group activity to keep everyone involved. Virtual events work well for a staff holiday party or employee holiday party with teams spread across different locations, ensuring everyone can participate in the festivities.

#### Hybrid Corporate Holiday Party

#### 

A hybrid holiday party combines onsite and virtual components, allowing both in-office and remote employees to join the celebration. You might host an in-person employee holiday luncheon for local staff while setting up a live stream for remote team members to tune in. This approach ensures that everyone feels included, making it perfect for larger, dispersed teams. Hybrid parties are a great option for a department holiday party or staff xmas party with employees located in various regions.

Work Holiday Party FAQs 

What to wear to a corporate holiday party? 

Dressing for a corporate holiday party typically requires finding a balance between festive and professional. The specific dress code can depend on the event’s venue and time of day, so check for any guidelines from the organizers. Here are a few options based on common dress codes:

  * **Business Casual** : Choose something polished but comfortable, like a nice sweater with tailored pants, or a blouse and skirt combo. Stick to festive colors or add a holiday accessory to keep it seasonal without going overboard.
  * **Formal or Semi-Formal** : For evening events at upscale venues, opt for cocktail attire. Men could wear a suit or a jacket and slacks, while women might choose a cocktail dress or a nice jumpsuit. A touch of holiday sparkle in accessories can add a seasonal touch without being too flashy.
  * **Themed Attire** : Some parties may have a specific theme, like “Ugly Sweater” or “Winter Wonderland,” allowing for more creative or casual choices. In this case, embrace the theme to add to the holiday spirit, but remember it’s still a work function, so keep it tasteful.



Ultimately, choose an outfit that aligns with both the event’s setting and your comfort level, while reflecting a bit of holiday cheer.

How to plan a corporate holiday party? 

Planning a corporate holiday party requires balancing logistics, budget, and team preferences to create a memorable experience. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

  1. **Define Your Goals and Budget** : Outline the purpose of the party—whether it’s to celebrate company successes, build team morale, or just relax together. Establishing a clear budget is also key, so you know how much can be spent on the venue, food, activities, and decorations.
  2. **Choose a Date and Time** : Pick a date that accommodates as many team members as possible. Weekday evenings or Friday afternoons often work well for corporate gatherings, but ensure it’s within regular work hours if attendance is expected.
  3. **Select a Venue** : Decide whether to host the event onsite, at a local restaurant, or a special venue. Make sure it’s easily accessible and accommodates your guest list comfortably.
  4. **Plan the Menu** : Cater to dietary restrictions and offer a variety of options, including vegetarian or gluten-free items. Having a mix of light appetizers, main courses, and dessert options ensures there’s something for everyone.
  5. **Organize Activities and Entertainment** : Depending on your group, choose low-key activities like a gift exchange, or more engaging ones like a trivia game, photo booth, or a holiday-themed performance.
  6. **Create a Schedule** : Build a rough schedule to keep the party flowing, including time for mingling, toasts, activities, and any formal presentations.



With these steps, you can design an event that feels festive, inclusive, and enjoyable for everyone.

How to throw a corporate holiday party? 

Throwing a successful corporate holiday party involves thoughtful planning and creating an enjoyable atmosphere. Here are key components:

  1. **Set a Festive Atmosphere** : Whether at the office or an external venue, create a festive ambiance with seasonal decorations, warm lighting, and holiday music.
  2. **Encourage Interaction** : Arrange tables and seating to foster mingling, and consider an icebreaker activity to help everyone feel comfortable. This could be a holiday trivia game, a photo booth, or a small gift exchange.
  3. **Incorporate Food and Drinks Thoughtfully** : Offering a variety of foods to suit all dietary needs, and having both alcoholic and non-alcoholic drink options, is important. Set up a station for holiday treats, like cookies or hot cocoa, for an added seasonal touch.
  4. **Express Appreciation** : Take a moment for toasts or speeches to recognize the team’s hard work. This can be a powerful way to connect and reflect on the year’s achievements.
  5. **Give a Small Token of Appreciation** : If your budget allows, consider giving a small holiday gift or personalized token to employees as a way of expressing gratitude.



By combining a festive environment with meaningful appreciation and thoughtful details, you can throw a holiday party that your team will remember.

When to have your corporate holiday party? 

Timing your holiday party can greatly impact attendance and engagement. Here are a few considerations:

  * **During Office Hours vs. After Hours** : For an onsite holiday luncheon or low-key celebration, holding the event during work hours ensures higher participation. For a more social evening event, after-hours on a Friday may be more fitting, allowing employees to fully unwind without workday responsibilities.
  * **Weekday vs. Weekend** : Mid-week events tend to have higher attendance, as weekends are often reserved for family time. Fridays work well for evening events, as people are typically more relaxed heading into the weekend.
  * **Holiday Season Window** : Aim for early to mid-December if possible, before employees start taking time off for personal holiday plans. Avoid the days right before major holidays when attendance might be lower.



Ultimately, select a date and time that allows your team to participate comfortably and enjoyably.

Where to have a holiday corporate party? 

Choosing a venue that aligns with your party goals and fits your team’s size and preferences is essential. Here are popular options:

  1. **Onsite at the Office** : Hosting an office party is cost-effective and convenient, particularly for daytime events. With a bit of decoration and a catered meal, you can transform the office into a festive space.
  2. **Local Restaurant or Bar** : Reserving a private room or section in a restaurant or bar offers a lively atmosphere without the need for set-up or clean-up. It’s a popular choice for smaller teams or departments.
  3. **Special Event Venues** : For a larger team or more formal event, consider event spaces like banquet halls, hotels, or unique venues like art galleries or breweries. These options allow for a customizable experience and often provide catering options as well.
  4. **Outdoor Settings** : If you’re in a warmer climate, an outdoor holiday gathering at a patio or rooftop venue can offer a unique twist and a festive, open-air experience.



Choosing the right location helps set the tone of the party, whether you want a cozy get-together, a professional dinner, or a lively celebration.
