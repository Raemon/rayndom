### 1\. Indulge in Chinese food on a Chinatown Food Tour

Did you know that the Chinatown in San Francisco is the oldest one in North America? This historic district is home to some of the best eats in the whole city! Join us for a pampered journey to 3-4 of the best restaurants in the area, on our [Chinatown Food Tour](https://avitalexperiences.com/experiences/san-francisco-chinatown-food-tour/). Skip all the lines and tuck into dishes like scallion and beef dumplings, avocado salmon egg rolls, or chocolate xiao long bao, on this three-hour odyssey through Chinatown.

### Have a Game Night

Turn your Home into a casino for one night only to celebrate your 40th birthday! All you need to do is set up a few fold-out tables, some packs of cards, poker chips, and keep the alcohol flowing. No real money needs to be involved to make this night a hit! You could either play with something like wrapped candy, start everyone out with about 25 pieces, and allow them to take home their winnings at the end of the night. Or give out 100 poker chips per person, and for every 50 each person has won/kept by the end of the party, give them one lottery ticket. End the party with a drawing to see who wins the silly or special items you pick out as prizes!

### 3\. Go on a Scenic Bike Ride

The Golden Gate Bridge is one of the best bike rides SF has to offer, between the views and the fact that if you elect to bike it on the weekend or weekdays after 3:30, you can enjoy the entire west side of the bridge, which is closed off from all vehicles and reserved for bikers and pedestrians to enjoy. You can either[ book a guided tour](https://www.blazingsaddles.com/san-francisco/routes-and-tours/bike-the-bridge) of the bridge and surrounding parks or [rent a bike](https://sfbiketours.com/bike-rentals/) and do it yourself. While you’re at it, we recommend biking around the base of the bridge to take in the historic Fort Point on the south side, as well as taking a moment to give a high five to the [Hopper’s Hand sign](https://www.parksconservancy.org/gateways-article/what-is-story-behind-hoppers-hands-fort-point).

### 4\. Virtual Mixology Class

If you’re not keen on crowds or want to celebrate with friends and family outside of the Bay, a [virtual happy hour](https://avitalexperiences.com/experiences/virtual-happy-hour-with-cocktail-kit/) checks all the boxes for a great 50th birthday party! Get all your cocktail ingredients delivered to your door to learn the basics of cocktail making with an award-winning mixologist. And when we say basics, we mean skills, not flavors. Since all of this is done virtually, no one needs to be left out! Make it a hybrid happy hour and invite a few close friends over to your place to learn the cocktails together, while letting your family join virtually from wherever.

### 5\. Take To The Skies

In a hot air balloon! Grab a loved one for this special ride, and toast to another decade. The best hot air balloon experiences occur over the stunning vineyards of Sonoma or Napa, so you’ll have to step outside the city proper for this one, but companies like [Sonoma Ballooning](https://sonomaballooning.com/) make it worth your while. They provide you with a pampered experience in the balloon, complete with views you’ve never seen before and memories to last a lifetime!

### 6\. Go on a Birthday Party Food Tour

For a special birthday meal, get treated like a VIP at a public or private [Birthday Party Food Tour in San Francisco](https://avitalexperiences.com/san-francisco/birthday-party-food-tours/). You’ll get to taste some of the most unique, quirky, authentic flavors of San Francisco, all while enjoying stories and the neighborhood and its history. It’s a different kind of birthday party, but going to dinner and drinks has been done many (many, many) times before, right? You can even add hands-on experiences like cocktail making to make the tour even more special. This is your 40th birthday— see the city in new ways, eat great food, and blow out some candles during dessert to celebrate a new year!

### 7\. Spend the Afternoon at a Food Truck Park

[Spark Social SF](https://sparksocialsf.com/) is a perfect place to celebrate your 50th birthday because they have an incredible selection of food trucks, a mini golf course, and a beer garden all in one place! The vendors vary a bit every day, but you can always expect to see places like Locksley Creamery, Momo Noodle, and Firetrail Pizza. There will be something for everyone to indulge in, no matter their tastes, and when you’re done stuffing yourselves, you can head over to the mini golf course for some friendly competition.

### 8\. Enjoy a Concert by Candlelight

Embrace the start of a new decade by taking your friends and family to a [candlelit concert](https://feverup.com/en/san-francisco/candlelight?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&cp_smn_source=secretsanfrancisco&cp_smn_content=birthday-plans-bay-area&cp_smn_term=text_cta_10&suid=d7de946e-8a97-4179-b918-c7b3a8570d04) in some of the most beautiful churches and performance spaces in San Francisco. These concerts range from being tributes to today’s biggest pop stars (I believe Bad Bunny was recently featured) to classical music concerts with incredible instrumentalists. The vibe cultivated by the glowing candles and beautiful music provides a lovely atmosphere to reflect on the past year and slow down and smell the roses for a moment. Whatever your music taste is, there’s sure to be an upcoming concert that would make for a perfect birthday celebration!

### 9\. Take in the Sites and Tastes of North Beach on a Walking Food Tour

Join us for a [North Beach Food Tour](https://avitalexperiences.com/experiences/san-francisco-north-beach-food-tour/)! This is the perfect experience for lovers of Italian food. While we bring you to each of the 3-4 Best Restaurants in North Beach San Francisco, we will tell you the history of this area, the Barbary Coast, which was one of the most notorious spots in all of America during the Gold Rush. If you would like to upgrade your experience, we have three perfect beverage pairings on offer. Without spoiling the surprise, some dishes you might get to sample on this tour would be: cioppino (a tomato-based seafood stew invented in SF!), wood-fired pizza, or cannolis!

### 10\. Take a Hike through Ancient Redwoods

The ancient Coast Redwood Trees in Muir Woods have to be seen to be believed. They tower over you at heights up to 250 feet, and some have been around for over 1,200 years. As you’re reflecting on the last decade of your life, it might feel good to commune with nature that’s been around much longer than you have. Enjoying good conversation and getting some physical activity with your favorite people in this gorgeous park is a perfect way to spend your 50th!

### 11\. Dine on the San Francisco Bay

Spend your birthday cruising around the Bay while enjoying good food and conversation with your favorite people. The views from the water are incredible; you’ll see the city skyline and the Golden Gate Bridge like never before. There are many incredible photo opportunities, so don a nice outfit and encourage your friends to do the same. Companies like [City Cruises](https://www.cityexperiences.com/san-francisco/city-cruises/premier-dinner-cruise/) offer premier dinner cruises where they serve craft cocktails and plated meals while live musicians serenade you in the background, which makes for a super special birthday celebration!

### 13\. Botanical Gardens After Dark

There is plenty to see in the Botanical Gardens of San Francisco during the day, but have you ever hung around after dark? [Flower Piano](https://gggp.org/flowerpiano/) is an event that occurs in the garden multiple times a year, and if it’s on when you’re celebrating your Birthday, you won’t want to miss it. A dozen pianos are scattered around the San Francisco Botanical Gardens, and on Flower Piano nights, pianists of all different genres and styles take up residence at the pianos. String lights and candles light the park, and there are food trucks and drinks for purchase.

### 14\. Test your Sleuthing Skills at an Escape Room

Speaking of classics, who doesn’t love a good [escape room](https://palace-games.com/)? We’d be remiss if we didn’t include an escape room experience as one of our 50th birthday party ideas in San Francisco. It’s fun, works great for groups, and challenges everyone. Instead of dinner and drinks, a game night adds some excitement. Escape the room, and reward yourself with a birthday dessert and drink at Côte Ouest Bistro (we would recommend sticking a candle in a slice of the decadent moelleux au chocolat cake and pairing it with a glass of Cabernet).

### 1\. Get Pampered with a Spa Experience

And not just any spa experience! If you’ve never been to a Korean Bathhouse, you are missing out. You can always expect to experience the most beautiful and well-maintained facilities and the best treatments. At [Pearl Spa](https://www.pearlspasf.com/blank-1), you can book a massage, scrub, and/or body wrap, but be sure to arrive much earlier. You need time to try out the steam room, dry sauna, hot tub, cold plunge, sitting and standing showers, Himalayan salt room, and red clay ball room. Every toxin and bit of tension in your body will seep out as you go from room to room chatting with your friends and enjoying the facilities. Bring all the girls for a full-day spa experience like no other!

### 2\. Sip some Wine while you Paint your Masterpiece

Paint and Sip classes are a lovely way to spend your birthday. [Paint the Town](https://paintthetown.com/party-packages/?utm_source=google_ads&utm_medium=ppc&utm_campaign=PTT_Onsite&utm_term=in%20person%20paint%20and%20sip&utm_adgroup=In%20Person_Phrase&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=12915136035&gbraid=0AAAAABjTo-ZBqybkRfxVRBUD8AbHlFzXX&gclid=CjwKCAjwtrXFBhBiEiwAEKen10YXEPbKqU0AstVMIWvZ4JtJpCkLkm4INW9i8FR6wUfaA7uDjhN9ghoCvQ8QAvD_BwE) offers private Paint and Sip classes and has many packages that can help you fit this experience into your party budget. They can also bring the supplies and instructor to you if you have a different venue in mind! Classes like these make party planning easy by getting you all the supplies, setting up the easels, and pouring the wine while you sit back and relax. But that doesn’t mean you can’t also DIY it! Head to your local Michaels and buy a few paint sets, packs of brushes, and some small canvases for everyone attending. Pair that with a few bottles of your favorite wine (or maybe more than a few), and a nice charcuterie board, and you have just created a night in that rivals any night out!

### 3\. Book an Incredible Brunch

San Francisco is a great town for Sunday Brunch fans! If you want to go all out snag a table at the Michelin Starred [Hilda and Jesse](https://www.hildaandjessesf.com/) where you can indulge in a five course “Chef’s Adventure Menu” or order delicious dishes a la carte such as a shrimp toastie, duck leg karaage, and spiced lamb meatballs. Or head to the incredibly popular [Outerlands](https://www.outerlandssf.com/) and get SF’s favorite breakfast sandwich or the fluffiest Dutch Pancakes you’ve ever had. And don’t worry, cocktails are on the menu at either establishment!

### 1\. Play Pickleball at Golden Gate Park

Head over to [Golden Gate Park](https://pickleballsf.com/golden-gate-park-tennis-complex/) for an epic Pickleball tournament with your boys. Pair everyone up in teams of two and have a few games going with the winners going on to play the winners until one team is victorious! The park offers courts at incredibly reasonable rates, just be sure to reserve far in advance of the big day because these courts fill up quickly. After you’ve worked up a sweat you can head over to the Little Shamrock Bar right at the edge of the park for a couple of cold pints and free popcorn.

Where: Golden Gate Park  
Price: $

### 2\. Take a Trip across the Bay for the Best Breweries

If you and your buds consider yourself beer aficionados (or at the very least, big fans of the drink), a bar crawl through the best breweries in the Bay Area might just be the perfect party idea! SF proper has a few good breweries, and if you want to stay local, we’ll point you right to House of Pizza (by Cellarmaker) in the Mission District. But true hop-heads know the best beer is in the East Bay, and it’s only a train ride away! Start at [Original Pattern Brewing](https://www.originalpatternbeer.com/), then walk to [Sante Adairius Rustic Ales](https://rusticales.com/), which is right next door to [Cellarmaker House of Pizza](https://cellarmakerbrewing.com/). After grabbing a few slices to sober up, pile into an Uber, and start heading towards the beach, hitting [Almanac Adventureland and Brewery](https://almanacbeer.com/) on the way, and ending the night at [Faction Brewing](https://www.factionbrewing.com/) with views of the Bay!

### 3\. Take the Boys Out to the Giants Game

If your birthday takes place between April and October, celebrate with the eight-time World Series champions, the San Francisco Giants. Games take place often, and there are different tiers of seating options. Book a box for you and your friends to hang out i,n or get a bunch of bleacher seats and have your buddies meet you out behind center left field. Before the game, sip on beers and nosh on bar snacks at [Public House](http://www.publichousesf.com/) or [21st Amendment](http://21st-amendment.com/). After the game, go to [Momo’s](http://www.sfmomos.com/) to keep the party going.

## Best Party Themes for an SF 50th Birthday Party

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20605'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2025-08-31-at-12.00.45-AM-1024x605.png)Photo Credit: Pexels User Mart Production

### 1\. Decades

Invite your guests to dress in the style of their favorite decade to celebrate your 50th! For the ’70s you can embrace flower power with long dresses and peace sign jewelry. Or you could put on spandex and crop tops for an ’80s jazzercise look. Your guests can get grungy with plaid flannels and ripped jeans to embody the ’90s. Or go all in on Y2K and dress like you’re straight out of Mean Girls or a Britney Spears music video. This is a great theme because it allows your guests to customize their look and pick the best costume accoutrement from their closet.

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20683'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/T5-pexels.com-stock-photo-1024x683.jpg)Photo Credit: Pexel User cottonbro studio

### 2\. Oscar Party

Embrace Hollywood Glamour with an Oscars-themed birthday party! Turn your home or venue of choice into a VIP Oscars afterparty for one night only. It doesn’t even have to coincide with Oscar’s season. This theme is all about dressing chic, embracing your cinephile side, and sipping your drink of choice out of champagne flutes (which can totally be plastic, we won’t tell). Put your favorite movie posters up on the wall, some old black and white film on the TV as set decoration, and roll out the red carpet for your guests to walk in on. Bonus points if you acquire a few of those life-size cardboard celebrities for hilarious photo ops with your guests!

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20683'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/pexels-kevinbidwell-2386728-1024x683.jpg)Photo Credit: Pexels User Kecin Bidwell

### 3\. Wild West

Who doesn’t love the Wild West! Don on a cowboy hat and neckerchief while you pump country music from the speakers. Get the grill out and serve barbecued meats and heaping bowls of cheesy chili to turn your house into the prairie! After you eat, take the party for a nightcap at Westwood in the Marina District where you can ride one of the only mechanical bulls left in the Bay Area. They serve delicious whiskey drinks and tex-mex snacks until 1:30am so the party can keep going all night long!

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20782'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2025-08-31-at-12.06.16-AM-1024x782.png)Photo Credit: Pexel User Kindel Media

### 4\. Tropical

Bring Island vibes to your birthday party when you choose a Tropical theme! San Francisco has beautiful sunny days and gorgeous beaches, so why not take advantage and throw this party outside? A tiki bar is a great touch, as well as having a few tiki torches scattered about. Set up a blender so you can keep plying guests with icy drinks like piña coladas and daiquiris all night long. Dress code is bathing suits, and Hawaiian shirts—and grab a few packs of Leis from Party City for the finishing touch!

  * **Photo Strips** : Rent out a photo booth so your guests can leave with cute photo strips to remember the party by.
  * **Custom Playing Cards** : Websites like [Shuffled Ink](https://shuffledink.com/?_vsrefdom=applwarehouseps&keyword=print%20playing%20cards&utm_term=print%20playing%20cards&utm_campaign=*%20EC%20-%20PC%20Printer/Company2&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=4309738980&hsa_cam=16011456141&hsa_grp=134367397884&hsa_ad=593554547447&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-1012705338&hsa_kw=print%20playing%20cards&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=16011456141&gbraid=0AAAAAD_jOqHL5PTl-y5IeXJ60JGPQZOql&gclid=Cj0KCQjwwsrFBhD6ARIsAPnUFD1h5c5BXgBSFBm7S_SiCmxImcm2LK4MomcmajJCinQt4HYI4LdfCKIaAnNuEALw_wcB) will print anything on playing cards, from your face, to a picture of your pet, or a logo custom made for your party.
  * **Hangover Kit** : Pack a bag with individual electrolyte packages, ibuprofen, mints, and a face mask. Your guests will thank you!
  * **Lottery Tickets** : Maybe one of your guests will win big and cut you in on their winnings!
  * **A Homemade Treat** : Show your friend you care by whipping up a batch of your favorite cookies and sending everyone home with a bagful.
  * **Personalized Matchbooks** : You never know when you’ll need a match, and next time your friends reach for one, memories of your incredible party will come flooding back.
