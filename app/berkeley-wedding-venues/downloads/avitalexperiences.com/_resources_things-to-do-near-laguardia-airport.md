LGA is located in Queens, New York, and has the title of 19th busiest airport in America. In 2024 an estimated 33.5 million people passed through it. The airport is 1,300 feet long and 180 ft wide making the smallest of New York’s three major airports.

## Getting To and From LGA 🚆

### Public Transit Options

If you are traveling to LaGuardia Airport from Manhattan you can rely on public transit to get you there. Locate the subway line nearest to you that can get you to transfer to the Q70-SBS bus or the M60-SBS bus. Apps like [City Mapper](https://wp-contents.apple.com/us/wp-content/citymapper-all-live-transit/id469463298) and the [MTA app](https://wp-contents.apple.com/us/wp-content/the-official-mta-wp-content/id1297605670) can be extremely helpful in navigating this, and finding the most direct route for you to take to the airport.

### Rental Cars

Terminal C of LaGuardia is the home of the car rental facilities for the airport. If you need to take a car around the city after your flight has landed this will be your first stop after baggage claim. Rental agencies provide a free shuttle from LaGuardia to the rental car facility that runs frequently. You can rent from Alamo, Avis, Budget, Dollar, Enterprise, Hertz, National, Payless, Sixt, or Thrifty. It is a good idea to contact them before your trip to make sure a car that fits your needs is ready for you to pick up when you land at LGA.

### Ride-Share

Uber and Lyft are great options for pickup and dropoff at LGA. By scheduling with a ride-share company in advance of your flight you can take advantage of fixed prices for your commute to or from LaGuardia. There is a high demand for ride-shares from the airport so scheduling ahead is key for making your experience as seamless as possible.

### Taxis

In NYC the classic yellow taxi is still, arguably, king! Metered taxi rides are available at every terminal, just follow the signs or locate an Airport Experience Specialist to point you in the right direction. On LaGuardia’s website, they give you [estimates on how much your ride from the airport to different Burroughs will run you](https://www.laguardiaairport.com/to-from-airport/by-taxi). 

### Drive to the Airport and Park (more on that below)

LaGuardia has three Parking garages, one for each terminal where you can park your vehicle if that is your preferred method of transportation.

![man parking car with luggage in hand outside sfo](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20900%20700'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![man parking car with luggage in hand outside sfo](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/man-parking-car-with-luggage-in-hand-outside-sfo.jpg)

## LaGuardia Airport Parking 🅿️

Book your parking spot ahead of time on LaGuardia’s website to save money and ensure your most convenient garage isn’t at capacity the day you fly. With one garage in each terminal odds are you will be able to snag a spot, but particularly around the holidays it is important to book your spot as soon as you can. If you want to travel luxuriously there are a select amount of premium spots in each garage you can reserve online that grant you the closest proximity to your terminal. 

The most economical parking option is to prepay for Economy Parking at least 24 hours in advance, where you will be charged $40 for the first 24 hours and $20 every 12 hours after that time elapses. Terminal A Prebooked parking will be capped at $50 a day, Terminal B Prebooked parking will cap at $55 a day, and Terminal C Prebooked Parking will cap at $60 a day. If you book under the 24-hour mark you can end up paying 15-19 more dollars per day depending on the Terminal you park at, so reserving in advance is key!

## Navigating the LGA Terminals ✈️

There are three Terminals at LaGuardia: A, B, and C. The airport is relatively small and designed so that you will never be more than 11 minutes away from your gate after exiting security. 

  * Terminal A has one concourse with gates 1-6
  * Terminal B has two concourses with gates 11-31 and 40-59
  * Terminal C has four concourses with gates 61-69, 71-79, 82-89, and 92-98

## Accessibility Information at LGA ℹ️

### TSA Cares

TSA Cares is a helpline that provides patrons with disabilities and medical issues information on the screening procedures they will undergo at the airport and will link you with someone to help you through this process in the airport. You are required to give 72 hours notice and you can contact them via phone at 855-787-2227 or via email at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

### Sunflower Lanyard

If you or your loved one has a hidden/invisible disability you can request a free Sunflower lanyard at the pre-security Welcome Center. This lanyard signals that you have a hidden disability such as PTSD, Autism, or are hard of hearing and that you may need extra support while traveling. Gate and Airport personnel are aware of this initiative and will be accommodating.

### Wheelchairs and Oxygen Devices

You need to alert your airline about wheelchair and oxygen device requirements before your flight. Contact info for all airlines that come through LaGuardia can be found [here](https://www.laguardiaairport.com/flight/airlines).

### Assistive Technology

[**AIRA**](https://aira.io)**– Artificial Intelligence Remote Assistance** : this is a mobile app to assist blind and low-vision travelers. A live remote agent will assist you by seeing your surroundings through your phone camera and directing you in real time. The app is free to download and use.

**ASL Translation Tech** : This is a new initiative from the Port Authority which is using new technology created by Convo Conversations, a deaf-owned company, to translate for passengers using ASL in real-time. You can scan a QR code at the airport to use this tech, which can be found in Welcome Center areas near baggage claim.

**Hearing Loops** : This assistive technology allows sound to be broadcast directly through your hearing aid. You can find these devices in all terminals using [this map](https://maps.laguardiaairport.com). Just remember to set your hearing aid to the T setting to receive the direct broadcast.

### Sensory Rooms

In Terminal C, after security, you can find a sensory room that all travelers are welcome to take advantage of without any prior notice. While open to all guests, these rooms were designed with neurodivergent travelers in mind. It is a quiet space to decompress from the overstimulating sights and sounds of the airport. It also has an area where you can sit in a model airplane to practice for your flight and work through your flying anxiety.

### Service Animals

You are welcome to travel with your service animal at LaGuardia Airport. They even have service animal and pet relief areas, also known as (SARA) before and after security. Be sure to check your airline’s policy on service animals and pets as they may have specific policies and require being notified a certain amount of time in advance.

### Best Lunch and Dinner Spots 🥗 

#### **Talde Noodle Bar**

#### **I’l Viaggi**

Recommendation: I’l Viaggi is serving up delicious Italian food all day, but if you ask diners about the highlight of their experience most will commend the service they received (which is a rare compliment for an airport restaurant.) Enjoy Italian classics like meatballs, chicken parmesan, pizza, and Italian hospitality at I’l Viaggi.

#### **Bubby’s**

American

#### **Calista Taverna**

Recommendation: You’d be surprised by the quality of the grilled Branzino being served up at Calista Taverna. Enjoy Greek classics done right and yummy specialty cocktails like the Sisyphus’s Day off, which combines rum and ube at this casual airport eatery.

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2040%2040'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/location-icon.svg)

Greek

#### **Chuko Ramen**

Recommendation: Chuko Ramen is a favorite Ramen joint of many New Yorkers, and it seems that its Laguardia counterpart does not disappoint. The sesame garlic ramen might just be the perfect comforting bowl of soup for a long travel day.

## History of the Laguardia Airport 📖

**1929** : The land is converted into a private airfield, and named the Glenn H. Curtis Airport.

**1935** : It is renamed The North Beach Airport. Shortly after this, Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia begins efforts to convert this private airfield into a commercial airport.

**1939** : After a 20 million dollar investment the airport officially opens for commercial voyages around December. It is known as the New York Municipal Airport-LaGuardia Field.

**1947** : Control of the airport is given over to The Port Authority and it is officially renamed LaGuardia Airport.

**1964** : Terminal B is built.

**1984** : Due to an inability to keep up with the growing demand for commercial flights the Port Authority institutes a rule that flights out of LGA will be to destinations no further than 1,500 miles.

**1992** : Terminal C opens.

**2016** : After harsh criticism about airport conditions 8 billion dollars are invested in redeveloping and modernizing the terminals.

**2021** : The redevelopment project is completed, and LaGuardia is back and in better shape than ever.
