### Nocturne

[Website](https://nocturnejazz.com)

[Open in Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fkGtuAHgckgJstkV8)

Nocturne is the place where jazz and hospitality meet. When you book a “Dinner & a Show” reservation, you get to choose three dishes off their seasonal three-course menu, and you can also supplement your meal with charcuterie and small plates a la carte. The menu may feature delicious dishes like a spicy oxtail polpetta, an umami carrot and miso gnocchi, and decadent desserts like a lavender buttercream matcha cake. 

You can opt to go all in and purchase the “Ellington Experience” (named after the Duke of Jazz himself), where you will be served a curated five-course tasting menu with wine pairings. As you enjoy the great food and wine, the ambiance of spirited live jazz and the supper club atmosphere will transport you all the way back to the 1930s.

### Brutø

[Website](https://www.brutodenver.com)

[Open in Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1HRRLyK8baPS86P17)

All it takes is opening Brutø’s website to know you’re in for something wholly original, edgy, and boundary-breaking. This restaurant serves a “crude, blunt, raw” tasting menu of Japanese-Nordic Fusion food that has caught the eye of the Michelin guide, garnering it one Michelin Star, as well as a Michelin Green Star for its environmentally conscious sourcing and disposal practices. 

This menu utilizes the hearth as a means of cooking and the process of fermentation in most of its dishes. The Michelin guide praises the “kombu-cured diver scallop with fermented crabapple and chamomile. The non-alcoholic pairings are especially intriguing, as in the lamb fat-washed Old Fashioned.” It’s sure to be a flavor-packed tasting experience showcasing dishes you’ve never experienced before.

### Hey Kiddo

[Website](https://www.hk-oy.com)

[Open in Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kE2JFCyacU1demVT6)

Hey Kiddo is like that effortlessly cool girl you were secretly jealous of in high school. Where else can you drop soju shots into your beer with one hand while taking caviar bumps off the other? If you’re feeling adventurous, you can choose from their reasonably priced, highly elevated rainbow cocktail selection (green, for example, is agricole rum, pandan, and muskmelon) or ball out and get bubbles for the table (for about 10x the price). 

The food menu operates much the same; you can get cheap small plates like pickled cucumbers, popcorn chicken, and the unmissable HK milk rolls with cultured butter, or you can opt for the luxurious “chef’s choice” seafood platter or, of course, the full caviar service featuring their “bling bling” caviar. It’s a delicious and exciting choose-your-own-adventure experience when you dine at Hey Kiddo.

### Buckhorn Exchange

[Website](https://www.buckhorn.com)

[Open in Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/s6G66ciEQnSeLaLo8)

When you walk into Buckhorn Exchange, you’ll immediately feel like you’ve been transported to a hunting lodge. Animal heads hang from every wall and adorn every available surface, and many of those animals are available for order on Buckhorn Exchange’s incredibly unique menu. Where else can you order elk, Cornish game hen, quail, buffalo steak and ribs, or Coloradoan lamb? 

With all these exotic meats on the menu, you might be surprised that the most popular dish is a beef steak… Maybe you’ll be less surprised when you find out this steak is big enough to feed 5 people and carved table-side! Check out their roof garden if you’re looking to throw a big bash for up to 60 people! 

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2040%2040'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/food-icon.svg)

### Margot

[Website](https://www.margotdenver.com)

[Open in Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TAHrmCpRWX6Gpemp7)

Margot has gone from its humble beginnings as a Sunday-only pop-up to a permanent one-Michelin-Star-awarded fixture in the Denver dining scene. Margot’s story isn’t the only thing that makes it unique; if you are one of twelve lucky guests at the chef’s counter, you will get to experience Chef Justin Fulton’s 10-course menu. He is a Coloradan native who infuses his contemporary American cuisine with the best seasonal produce and the deep, comforting flavors of his home state. 

The Michelin Guide gushes about the “Individual loaves of fluffy olive oil brioche, freshly baked for each guest, [that] capture the meal’s easygoing charms.” This cultivated 10-course menu will leave you feeling pampered and impressed!

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2040%2040'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/food-icon.svg)

### SuperMegaBien

[Website](https://supermegabien.com)

[Open in Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Q4gs35GL5trSXqFb6)

SuperMegaBien is serving up some of the best Latin food in all of Colorado, but that isn’t what won them a spot on our list today. If you’ve ever been to an authentic dim sum restaurant, you probably enjoyed some of the best dishes of your meal right off the cart they push around to each table. SuperMegaBien has taken this ingenious invention and given it its own twist by creating a Latin Dim Sum cart! 

This adds a sense of adventure to your meal because you can pick whatever looks good as it’s passing by, which will have you sampling dishes you never would have ordered off the menu. They say the eyes eat first, and when you see plates of vibrant chimichurri-coated carne asada and bright avocado mousse-adorned tuna ceviche, you’ll find yourself waving down the cart over and over again.

### **Beckon**

[Website](https://www.beckon-denver.com)

[Open in Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/E19GV7wTsbAMcj2r8)

Beckon is another Denver tasting menu that has won a star from the Michelin Guide. The concept and atmosphere here are very different from Brutø. Beckon works with the seasons, and there’s a spiritual tilt to their approach as they speak about the moon’s position in the sky and the turning of the seasons as highly influential towards their menu offerings. 

When you enter the futuristic dining area with its warm brown and blue earth tones, you know immediately something magical is about to begin. Then they ask if you want to eat the vegetarian or omnivore menu, and from there, fantastical vegetable-focused dishes like a black truffle calrose rice, buttery bass with tarragon, and salmon radish, or duck decorated with butternut squash and pumpkin seeds come out one after another. It’s a special dining experience that will engage your every sense.

### Linger Eatuary

[Website](https://ediblebeats.com/restaurants/linger/)

[Open in Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/V3YFkFVqQc5ZRF2v7)

Most people don’t associate mortuaries with food and certainly not with enjoying one of the better meals of their lives, but Linger “Eatuary” might just change your mind on that. Linger Eatuary was once Olinger Mortuary, owned by a family that had the monopoly on human remains in Colorado for many years. Their claim to fame was that they held Buffalo Bill’s body for six months while Colorado and Wyoming argued over where his body would have its final resting place (Colorado won)! 

Linger had kept the foundations of the mortuary and converted the inside into an epic dining room, while keeping small reminders of its origins, like the priest’s pew that is now the host stand, and the glass-covered conveyor belts that are now tables. Linger is one of our favorite [Denver restaurants for large groups](https://avitalexperiences.com/resources/denver-restaurants-for-large-groups/) because it has multiple levels and an awesome rooftop happy hour, which makes dining with a big group of friends a delight! You’ll leave this unique and morbid dining spot with your belly full and (perhaps ironically) a lust for life!

## Other Unique Dining Experiences in Denver 

If you’re after Denver’s most unique dining experiences, not every meal is about the chef’s tasting menu or the perfect wine pairing. Some nights, the food plays second fiddle to the fun. These immersive, theatrical, and downright unusual dinner experiences may not top the city’s fine dining charts, but they’re perfect when you’re craving novelty and entertainment.

### **The Fort: Dining in the Dark & Murder Mystery Nights**

At The Fort, a replica of an 1800s adobe fur trading post, dinner is served with a side of drama. The restaurant hosts themed evenings like [Dining in the Dark](https://www.thefort.com/friday-night-doins/), where guests eat blindfolded to heighten the senses, and [Murder Mystery Dinners](https://www.thefort.com/friday-night-doins-1/), where you can play detective between bites of bison steak. It’s a one-of-a-kind setting that feels part museum, part dinner theater.

### **Murder Mystery Dinners**

If murder mystery dinners are your thing, Denver has quite a few options: 

  * **[The Dinner Detective](https://www.thedinnerdetective.com/denver/)** : America’s largest interactive murder mystery dinner show, blending improv comedy with a multi-course meal.
  * **[Adams Mystery Playhouse](https://adamsmysteryplayhouse.com/)** : A long-running local favorite with costumed actors, themed menus, and plenty of audience participation.
  * **[The Murder Mystery Co](https://www.murdermysteryco.com/dinner-theater/denver/).**: A touring troupe that brings customizable mystery themes (from masquerade balls to 1920s speakeasies) to venues across the city.



### **The Catamounts: FEED**

Part theater, part supper club, [FEED](https://www.thecatamounts.org/category/feed/) is an experimental dining event from Boulder-based theater collective The Catamounts. Each installment pairs a multi-course meal with original performance pieces that explore food, culture, and connection. It’s artistic, communal, and totally unlike your typical night out.

### **Dinner & Escape Room**

For those who like a little mental challenge with their meal, [Solutions Lounge](https://solutionsrestaurant.com/) combines craft cocktails and upscale comfort food with fully immersive escape rooms. Dine before or after solving puzzles, cracking codes, and racing against the clock — or stay for trivia and cocktails in the steampunk-inspired bar.
