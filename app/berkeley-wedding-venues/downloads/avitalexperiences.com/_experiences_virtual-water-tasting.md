### **“It was AMAZING!”**

My team recently did a water tasting with Avital. It was AMAZING! We tasted different waters from all over the world. We learned so much about what makes water taste great. We will never think about water the same way again.

## What Is Virtual Water Tasting?

Virtual water tasting is a unique sensory experience that allows participants to engage in the tasting of water from different sources around the world. Guests can explore the taste, smell, and even the mouthfeel of water from various locations, ranging from pristine natural springs to urban tap water and exotic watersheds. Guests can even sample food pairings during the tasting to see how the flavors of the food and water interact. This experience not only raises awareness about the diverse qualities of water but also highlights the global importance of water conservation and responsible usage.

FAQ 

What’s a “Certified Water Sommelier?” 

It may sound unusual, but all of our Water Sommeliers are certified by the Fine Water Academy. They are true experts in the culinary world of water and will be sure to change your perspective on h2o!

What’s in the water tasting kit? 

Water Tasting boxes contain 5 full-size beautiful glass bottles (wine-bottle size) of luxury waters, two pairings (charcuterie and chocolate,) and a water testing trip (for testing the mineral content of your home water).

When do you need our addresses? 

Addresses must be submitted at least 10 business days in advance to ensure pre-event delivery of your ingredients. Or add rush shipping to reduce to 7 business days in advance (+$20 per delivery).

What if I have some international participants? 

No problem! We have international shipping available for Water Tasting boxes. Please inform us ahead of time so we can plan accordingly, as some countries require additional lead time or additional shipping costs.

Will I be notified about tracking for ingredient delivery? 

Yes! We send tracking information/numbers as soon as we receive them from our shipping carriers. Please contact [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) with any questions or concerns you may have about tracking for your event, and our team will be happy to help!

What if I don’t know my total number of guests? 

That’s okay! Book your event with a deposit for your minimum attendance estimate. Final count due 10 business days prior to event (with your mailing addresses.)

Is there time to share our company’s content? 

Yes! Standard run time is 45-60 minutes, with flexibility for up to 10 minutes of your own content. If you need additional time, you can add hosted emcee time at $25 per 15 minutes. Alternatively, you may host on your own platform account (we join for 1 hour before/after your content, no extra staff time charges.)

What if I need a shorter event? 

Our Water experience is carefully curated to be a cohesive, energetic experience for your guests and works best when you stick to our well-rehearsed timing. We do our best to accommodate requests for condensed experiences, but want to set your expectations and encourage you to let us do what we do best, in 45-60 minutes.

Can we use our own platform? 

Yes! You are welcome to host on your own account/platform instead of our Avital Zoom if you wish. Our staff is fluent on Google Meet, Zoom, WebEx, and Teams, and must be granted access to Screen Share, Chat, and Mute capabilities. For all other platforms, please inquire about capability and recommendations. Platforms with two-way/group video capabilities are best for this interactive experience.

Can we schedule a rehearsal call? 

All event packages include 15 minutes extra prior to your event start time for any sound checks or tech checks you may need with our Emcee. 

Do I need special tools? 

Nothing fancy! You’ll just need six glasses & a bottle opener.
