#  Corporate Entertainment Case Study: Camp Connection 

August 7, 2025 

![medium_large](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/wine-tasting-table-during-corporate-event-entertainment-768x1024.jpg)

![medium_large](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/camp-connection-table-home-mugs-768x1024.jpg)

When our client Connection came to us with a unique challenge—create an engaging experience for guests not participating in their annual golf outing—we saw an opportunity to bring a playful twist to a classic event. Rather than simply filling the gap, we aimed to create something memorable, interactive, and on-brand.

Use Case: Annual Golf Outing, Boston

### **Challenge**

Each year, Connection hosts a high-profile golf outing in Boston. While the golfing portion of the event is well-established, the client wanted to elevate the experience for guests who don’t participate in golf. They needed an engaging, high-touch activity that matched the event’s prestige, something more thoughtful than simply “filling time,” and ideally something that would create a lasting impression. They also wanted the Connection brand to shine while also highlighting their sponsors. 

### **Solution**

We pitched a series of hands-on concepts and themes, each highlighting our**[Interactive Bars](https://avitalexperiences.com/interactive-bars/)**. 

![golf outing concepts](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20600'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![golf outing concepts](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/golf-outing-concepts.jpg)

The client ultimately chose **Camp Connection** : A nostalgic, summer-camp-inspired experience reimagined for grownups. The event included three elements: A custom wine tasting experiences, plus two of our Interactive Bars, customized to fit the camp theme perfectly. 

#### Fine **Wine Tasting & Nostalgic Camp Snacks**

Our in-house wine expert, Noelle, led an incredible tasting featuring elevated wines paired with playful, nostalgic snacks reminiscent of camp canteens. Think fine rosé with a sweet and gooey Rice Krispy Treat, and Barbera with Cheez-Its. 

The 45-minute tasting was the perfect blend of structured guidance and time to sip and chat. After the tasting guests got a full glass of their favorite wine as they mixed and mingled at the other hands-on stations.

#### **Make Your Own Savory S’mores**

Guests selected their cheese, cured meats, and gourmet spreads from the buffet table inside. Then they headed out to the patio to gathered around mini fire pits to roast their cheese. Once the cheese was melted they constructed their s’mores on mini charcuterie boards and indulged. A cozy throwback to fireside bonding without the sugar crash.

![savory smores table mockup](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20663'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![savory smores table mockup](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/savory-smores-buffet-table-mockup-1024x663.jpg) ![savory smores table](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20768'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![savory smores table](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/savory-smores-table-1024x768.jpg)

#### **DIY Nut Mix Bar & Branded Take-Home** Gifts

Guests created custom nut mix blends, selecting their favorite nuts and seeds. Then they choose different spices and salt before adding oil and shaking up their jars so every nut was coated to perfection. The jars were labeled with the Camp Connection branding for guests to take home. This served as both an interactive activity and a keepsake.

![spiced nut mix table mockup](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20663'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![spiced nut mix table mockup](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/nut-mixing-table-mockup-1024x663.jpg) ![spiced nut mix bar](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20768'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![spiced nut mix bar](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/spiced-nut-mix-bar-1024x768.jpg)

#### Special Event Touches 

Here are a few little elements we incorporated into the event to make it a truly memorable and unique experience.

##### Happy Camper Welcome Pins

All guests received a cute "Happy Camper" pin as they were welcomed by our hosts, complete with Connection logo.

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/camp-connection-logo-150x150.jpg)

##### Custom Event Logo & Branding

We designed a custom "Camp Connection" logo and colors to be used throughout the event branding.

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/camp-connection-signage-150x150.jpg)

##### Branded Signage Throughout

We seamlessly incorporated not only the Connection logo, but also their sponsors' logos on event signage 

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/camp-connection-table-home-mugs-150x150.jpg)

##### Take-Home Gifts

We sourced and designed themed take-home gifts (in addition to the spiced nut mix), including a metal camp cup and wooden wine opener. 

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/camp-connection-hosts-150x150.jpg)

##### Camp Counselor Hosts

The camp counselors (aka the expert Avital hosts) dressed the part with vintage bandanas and a polished look. 

### **Results**

**The event was a hit.** Guests were fully engaged and thrilled by the novelty and detail of the activation. 

The[ **Spiced Nut Mixing Bar**](https://avitalexperiences.com/experiences/spiced-nut-mixing-bar/) emerged as a surprise favorite—attendees were genuinely excited about crafting their blends, and the branded jars became a cherished takeaway.

**C-suite executives** personally complimented our staff on the creativity and quality of the experience.

The client reported strong feedback across the board and praised the event for enhancing the overall golf outing in a way that felt thoughtful and fun.

Camp Connection transformed a passive time slot into a standout feature of the event. By tapping into nostalgia and pairing it with elevated, hands-on experiences, we created a space where guests could connect, play, and indulge. The overwhelmingly positive feedback — from attendees and execs alike — confirmed what we already believed: with the right concept, even the “non-golfing” portion of an event can steal the show.
