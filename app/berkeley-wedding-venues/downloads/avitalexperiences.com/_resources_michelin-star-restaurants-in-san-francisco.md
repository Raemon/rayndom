## A Brief History of the Michelin Star System

**1889** – Brothers Andre and Edouard Michelin founded their tire company at a time when France had less than 3,000 cars in the entire country. Included with your purchase of tires was a little red book filled with maps, where to fill up with fuel, where to stay the night, and where to eat on your journey.

**1920** – The Brothers see an opportunity to monetize this popular little red book. They launch a brand new Michelin Guide and sell it for seven francs. It now includes a list of hotels and restaurants sorted by category. This is when they recruited their team of mystery diners, known as restaurant inspectors today, to anonymously visit and review these restaurants.

**1926** – The star system begins. At the time, fine dining establishments would be marked with a single Star in the book. 

**1936** – The 3-Star system was fully developed, and the criteria for the Star rankings were published.

**Today** – Michelin guides are best sellers! The guide now encompasses 40,000+ rated establishments in 24+ territories, across 3 continents.

### Atelier Crenn

[Website](https://www.ateliercrenn.com)

[Open in Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fpaNr6cPtvJ6WWPj7?g_st=ipc)

Atelier Crenn is as well known for its story as it is for the phenomenal food it’s been serving since it opened in 2010. The story is this: Chef Dominique Crenn opened Atelier Crenn as a “deeply personal project” where she could cook her ode to “poetic culinaria.” In the first year, she was awarded 1 Michelin Star, the next, a history-making 2nd Star, as Chef Crenn was now the first female chef to run a 2 Michelin Star restaurant. 

If that wasn’t a grand enough accomplishment, Crenn beat her own record by earning a 3rd Star in 2018! Another attribute that makes Atelier Crenn so special is its dedication to ethical sourcing practices and sustainability. This is reflected in the pescatarian, vegetable-forward menu, with the only dairy used coming from 2 trusted small farms that supply all of the butter and cream they require.

**Best for: Taking your environmentally-conscious colleagues out for a guilt-free, high-end dining experience.**

Benu is not afraid to brag about its accolades; you can read the long list under the information tab on their website in place of a traditional “about us” page. The highlights are their 3 Michelin Stars, ranking in the world’s 50 best restaurants list in 2021, being featured in the New York Times article entitled “10 Restaurants Worth a Plane Ride”, as well as receiving 2 James Beard awards. When you enter the serene dining room, your first bites are small technical marvels executed to perfection. The culinary wonders don’t stop there; the Michelin Guide cites the faux-shark’s fin and xiao long bao as two of the menu’s most memorable dishes. 

**Best for: This is a great spot to celebrate your anniversary or take a business associate.**

### Quince

[Open in Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vfPKzBiuW7YBqacG8)

Quince has 3 Michelin Stars as well as a Michelin Green Star for their relationship with a sustainable agriculture farm that supplies most of their ingredients. The ever-changing seasonal menu makes repeat dining a joy, and small touches like the vintage amaro cart they wheel to your table after the entree will leave you feeling impressed and pampered. You can choose between their decadent 10-course menu or dine a la carte, making this a perfect restaurant for a special celebration of any magnitude.

**Best For: Impressing your partner, or taking the big brass out to celebrate a job well done.**

### Lazy Bear

[Open in Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7CyBgaY9Wg8Ve8iG7)

Lazy Bear is throwing the best dinner party in town every night! It’s no wonder given its humble beginnings in Chef David Barzelay’s own apartment. His passion for hosting elaborate dinner parties became a career when he was laid off from his job as a lawyer in 2009. He went from cooking out of the apartment, to a secret warehouse, to this fabulous space in the Mission District where Lazy Bear resides today. You’ll be seated at long communal tables with friends and strangers alike, while you watch the chefs craft incredible dishes in the open kitchen. Lazy Bear proves that fine dining does not have to be boring or stuffy. It can be a party!

Fun Fact: Lazy Bear was the restaurant of choice for our 2024 $500 Michelin Gift Card Giveaway. [Sign up for this year’s giveaway!](https://avitalexperiences.myflodesk.com/links)

### Saison

[Open in Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wyp3wx3BjGb5Kk767)

The Michelin guide calls Saison “at once playful and proudly earnest.” Perhaps this is what has captured the hearts of the San Francisco elite who keep coming back for more. The heart of Saison is its open wood fire hearth that is central to both the cooking and the ambiance of the space. Depending on where you’re seated, you might even have a front row seat to the open concept kitchen and the culinary wonders being created inside. 

**Best for: Celebrating your anniversary, or taking a fellow food-enthusiast out for an incredible experience.**

When Chef Harrison Cheney took over Sons and Daughters in 2022, he made a big splash serving up seasonal New Nordic cuisine. He was awarded the Michelin Young Chef Award in 2023, and his work inarguably landed Sons and Daughters their second Michelin Star in 2024. Sit back and know you’re in good hands when eating his $295 tasting menu.

Kiln is not easily defined, and we mean that as a compliment! The food is a boundary-pushing blend of New Nordic, Japanese, and Californian cuisine. The one thing everyone can agree on about Kiln is that it offers a unique and delectable dining experience you won’t soon forget. You might be served puffed beef tendon or squab breast with truffle jus. No matter what is on the plate placed in front of you, you will leave satisfied and impressed.

[Open in Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bzYFVEeMFfQj85uf8?g_st=ipc)

Mister Jiu’s is a bright sunny restaurant with big round tables where you and your party will have plenty of room to dig into incredible dishes, like their iconic Liberty Farms Peking-style whole roasted duck. Pair this with one of their signature cocktails, and you are halfway to food heaven! At special reserved tables, you can also opt for the prix fixe menu that the Michelin Guide describes as “a light repast.” Perhaps that means you’ll still have room to indulge in one of their incredible desserts!

The Progress has made its home in an old silent film theater. The concept of the restaurant is described as “a [W]holistic approach to Modern Rustic Cooking.” The dish repeat diners say you cannot miss is the Liberty Farms barbecued duck. This is one of the most accommodating spots for large group dining on this list, which makes it an excellent option for a private party or casual corporate event.

### Nari

⭐️ Avital’s Favorite

[Website](https://www.narisf.com/story)

[Open in Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UtJyvTWJ9hzKdXqk7?g_st=ipc)

Nari is a Thai fine-dining restaurant, where both the name and the menu are inspired by the generations of Thai women who laid the foundations for this bold and remarkable cuisine. Enjoy the finest caviar on scallion roti with salted duck egg, or the tender lamb shank with massaman curry and grilled nectarines (if you can handle the spice.) This menu is drool worthy and with multiple private dining options there’s no excuse to not bring a big group and order everything.

**Best For: Hip corporate events or a special birthday feast.**

### Niku Steakhouse

[Open in Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HiVxtu39vh3QYW8YA)

Niku Steakhouse has elevated the experience of enjoying a great steak and martini. It has a sleek, contemporary, business-casual vibe rather than the white tablecloth, buttoned-up, atmosphere of a classic steakhouse. Ordering the fatty A5 Wagyu is a life-affirming experience. All the meat is cooked to perfection and prominently displayed in the adjacent butcher shop’s window you pass as you enter. This is the coolest and most VIP you’ll ever get to feel while dining on steak.

**Best For: Swanky business dinners and anniversary celebrations.**

Hilda and Jesse is a unique queer-owned restaurant in North Beach that prides itself on cultivating an atmosphere of “fun-luxury.” Just last year, they earned their first Michelin star, proving this spot just keeps getting better with time. They originally made a splash by offering “brunch for dinner,” so their brunch is definitely worth indulging in. Or come around dinner time to experience the chef’s tasting menu that has historically featured dishes like aged duck breast, Mediterranean spicy cucumbers, and dandelion chocolate lava cake. 

**Best for: A phenomenal Sunday brunch experience, or an eclectic date night.**

### Good Good Culture Club

[Website](https://goodgoodcultureclub.com)

[Open in Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/M1SZc4TD4FxKSjFS7)

The only difficult thing about a night out at Good Good Culture Club is getting a reservation! This consistently crowded spot cares about two things: serving you the most flavorful California-inspired Southeast Asian food you’ve ever tasted, and upholding their ethics and values in the way they treat customers, staff, and one another. At Good Good Culture Club, they believe that “we must take care of one another through a lens of kindness and care.” You will feel that care when you bite into the adobo-braised chicken wings with garlic rice, or their sausage with pasilla pepper jaew.

**Best for: Big group dinners with friends, family, or even a casual night out to celebrate the end of the quarter with your team.**

### Outerlands

[Open in Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5maYPvUrT9UF3AmV8)

Outerlands is focused on sustainability, serving up local, organic food right by the beach. This is a favorite brunch spot for many SF locals. The asparagus and spring onion galette is hearty and comforting, and the Dutch pancakes are like eating a delicious fluffy pillow. The dinner menu is equally fabulous and has the added bonus of allowing you to make a reservation ahead of time. So if you can’t wait in the brunch line, head to Outerlands for dinner instead!

**Best for: A fabulous brunch or a big family dinner.**

### Izakaya Rintaro

[Website](https://izakayarintaro.com)

[Open in Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aBdqkbMXhs1nWdDA8)

Rintaro describes its cuisine as “Japanese Izakaya by way of California.” Izakaya is a type of Japanese pub-style dining where drinks and small snacks are shared. Rintaro’s menu takes these “small snacks” to the next level by serving dishes like chrysanthemum greens with duck breast, pork gyoza with chicken foot jelly, and Bigeye tuna with raw egg yolk. You can sit at the bar and watch the chefs grill chicken on the binchotan-burning Yakitori Grill or enjoy the good weather by snagging a seat in the scenic courtyard.

**Best For: Taking a group of friends to celebrate your birthday.**

If hand-wrapped dumplings are your thing, Dumpling Home is your place to be.

### A16

[Website](https://www.dumplinghome.com/)

[Open in Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kj9Kk9w8Dv2Y9erRA)

Named after the highway that runs through southern Italy, A16 serves wood-fired pizzas and rustic pasta with a focus on Southern Italian flavors. It has earned its Bib Gourmand badge by turning Neapolitan pizza and seasonal pastas into a cozy, flavorful ritual. Bonus points: their wine list is a deep dive into lesser-known Italian varietals.

### Other Honorable Mention Michelin Bib Gourmand Restaurants

Here are some of our other favorite Michelin Bib Gourmand Restaurants in San Francisco. 

#### **Anchor Oyster Bar**

This Castro neighborhood gem is seafood without the fuss. Think Dungeness crab, clam chowder, and oysters shucked to order. It’s tiny, it’s cozy, and it’s the kind of place locals don’t want to tell you about.

#### **Trestle**

Affordable fine dining is Trestle’s whole vibe. Their three-course prix fixe delivers Michelin-level quality without blowing your entire paycheck. Pro tip: add the pasta course—it’s always worth it.

#### **Flores**

Colorful, modern Mexican food with the warmth of abuela’s kitchen. Flores nails the balance of bright cocktails, handmade tortillas, and bold flavors—best enjoyed with friends and a margarita (or three).

#### **Z &Y**

A legend in Chinatown, Z&Y is the place to go if you like your Sichuan food bold, spicy, and a little numbing (in the best way). Even presidents have eaten here—proof it’s truly a power move to order the chili chicken.

#### Okane

This SoMa izakaya is small but mighty, serving up sushi, sashimi, and share plates that feel both traditional and modern. It’s the kind of spot where a “quick bite” suddenly turns into hours of sake sipping.

#### **Del Popolo**

Once a roaming pizza truck, now a brick-and-mortar with serious cred. Del Popolo’s wood-fired pies are chewy, blistered, and perfectly charred—basically the stuff of pizza dreams.

#### **Bansang**

Modern Korean with a San Francisco twist. Bansang plays with flavor and presentation, turning familiar dishes like bibimbap and short ribs into something sleek, stylish, and totally craveable.

## Best Michelin Recommended Restaurants in San Francisco​

Michelin recommended restaurants are above-average, fantastic dining experiences, they just haven’t quite reached the level required for the higher accolades. They’re usually more affordable as well, making them a great option for more casual outings. There are many in San Francisco; here are our favorites. 

![zuni cafe, one of best restaurants in San Francisco](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20473%20710'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![zuni cafe, one of best restaurants in San Francisco](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/zunicafe.com_.jpg)Image Credit: zunicafe.com

### Zuni Café

⭐️ Avital’s Favorite

[Website](https://zunicafe.com)

[Open in Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BLSLkzV73LdHj5Xt7?g_st=ipc)

Zuni Café has been a fixture of the San Francisco dining scene since its conception in 1979. From its very humble beginnings (a kitchen that was composed of a toaster and an espresso machine that doubled as an egg cooker), Zuni Café has gone on to catch the eye of the Michelin Guide and has won two James Beard Awards. This is possibly the best plate of chicken and fries you’ll ever eat, all the while enjoying that old-school scrappy San Francisco energy Zuni Café has maintained all these years.

**Best For: Taking in a piece of San Francisco history over a comforting meal.**

Or book out the Gen Gen Room for 10-18 and enjoy a myriad of appetizers, one entree per guest (Ling Cod with a shrimp crust, Lyc Spamm with hurricane rice, or sweet and sour fried game hen), and two delectable desserts. 

**Best For: Family-style group dining with your loved ones. You could host an unforgettable birthday party here!**

Verjus is a charming wine bar with an elevated french menu. The atmosphere is romantic and European. We highly recommend ordering one of the house made sausages, but you’d be remiss not to pick at least one seafood dish off the menu as well. For dessert the brioche pan perdu is non-negotiable.

### Prelude

[Website](https://www.preludesf.com)

[Open in Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2FuYfFtEVLr8TjZB6)

Prelude brings Southern cuisine to the West Coast. Executive Chef Celtin Hendrickson-Jones may have grown up in California, but his tastes were majorly influenced by the cooking of his grandmother and great-grandmother from Alabama. He puts a fine-dining slant on classic southern dishes with creations like crayfish étouffé and smoked catfish dumplings. We recommend you put your trust in this great chef’s hands and order the tasting menu to get the best of everything, but you can’t go wrong ordering a la carte either.

**Best For: Hosting an intimate end-of-quarter celebration for your team, or treating your parents to a nice meal.**

### Flour + Water

Who doesn’t love fresh hand-made pasta and Neapolitan-style pizza? Flour + Water changes their menu every day in order to serve you the best seasonal ingredients available, at their No-Cal-inspired Italian restaurant. They also have great private dining spaces, and host exciting pasta-making courses that you can take advantage of. If you’re in the mood to treat yourself, we highly recommend getting the tasting menu here. The halibut crudo is refreshing, the dulse seaweed rigatoni is completely original, and finishing the meal with the delicate flavorful quail, or the decadent chocolate budino is an unparalleled experience.

### The Wild

⭐️ Avital’s Favorite

[Website](https://www.thewildsf.com)

[Open in Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/M2qqh5PcfSZTuCeMA)

Chefs Marc Zimmerman and Peggy Tan describe The Wild as a restaurant that “embarks on a journey that delves into a reconnection with the natural world, emphasizing a return to our roots and the simplicity of nature.” What this means in layman’s terms is that they’re focused on using California’s best and most sustainable ingredients to create a menu that is intentional and lets the fresh protein and produce on your plate be the star of the meal. Their menu is constantly changing, which makes this a restaurant that their patrons keep returning to again and again.

**Best for: Do a full restaurant buyout and bring the whole company, or bring your partner and feel good about the meal you two are sharing.**

## FAQs on SF Michelin Restaurants

What does Michelin Bib Gourmand mean? 

A Michelin Bib Gourmand is awarded to restaurants with the “best value for money.” Michelin inspectors are looking at the price of a three-course meal, the quality of the food, and the high standard of the dining experience, and awarding this to restaurants where those three things align. Michelin says on their website that there’s no exact formula–how could there be when the cost of living is so different everywhere you go? But what they do know for sure is “[a] Bib Gourmand restaurant will leave you with a sense of satisfaction, at having eaten so well at such a reasonable price.”

What does Michelin Recommended mean? 

When it comes to Michelin Recommended establishments, Michael Ellis, the International Director of the Michelin Guide, puts it best: “A restaurant in the selection without a star or Bib Gourmand is the sign of a chef using quality ingredients that are well cooked; simply a good meal… It means that the inspectors have found the food to be above average, but not quite at star or Bib level.” So if you see a restaurant in their red book (or let’s be honest, one their website) without any stars or a Bib Gourmand symbol, you can still count on having a great meal!

How many Michelin Star restaurants are in San Francisco​? 

San Francisco consistently ranks among the top dining cities in the U.S., with around 30 Michelin-starred restaurants, ranging from one-star neighborhood gems to world-renowned three-star icons. (Numbers can shift each year with the new Guide release.)

What’s the best Michelin Star restaurant in San Francisco? 

That depends on your definition of “best.” For luxury tasting menus, **Atelier Crenn, Quince,** and **Benu** are three-star stunners. Right now, **Lazy Bear** is our favorite 2-Star restaurant and **Nari** is our favorite 1-Star restaurant. **Zuni Cafe** and**The Wild** are our favorite Michelin Recommended restaurants.

What are affordable Michelin Star restaurants San Francisco? 

Affordable and Michelin Star don’t usually go hand-in-hand, but San Francisco does have accessible options. **State Bird Provisions** (one star) offers small plates in a fun, cart-service style. For even friendlier prices, check the **Michelin Bib Gourmand** list, which includes delicious, wallet-kind spots like **Yank Sing** (dim sum), **Del Popolo** (pizza), and **Flores** (modern Mexican).

## We Make Restaurants Cooler

At Avital, we don’t just take you to the best Michelin star restaurants San Francisco has to offer—instead, **we turn fine dining into fun dining!**

On our [food tours](https://avitalexperiences.com/san-francisco/), one meal means savoring three to four of the best restaurants, curated with stories and iconic neighborhood stops.

These are great for smaller groups and all occasions. Whether you’re hosting a team building activity, looking for the perfect gift for an SF foodie, or visiting from out of town and feeling overwhelmed by trying to fit all the best Michelin restaurants into your itinerary.

And for [private dining events](https://avitalexperiences.com/san-francisco/private-dining/), we transform basic private dining rooms into an interactive experience, layering on hands-on activities that spark connection.
