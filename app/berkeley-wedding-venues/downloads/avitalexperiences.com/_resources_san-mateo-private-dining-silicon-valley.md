[Website](https://www.vespucciristorante.com/private-events)

[Open in Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yqsjc7Vx3dZ2zJET8)

Vespucci Ristorante is one of our favorite San Mateo restaurants with private rooms, because they work with you to create a personalized menu for your event, and have the capacity to seat up to 50 guests. The private dining space is laid out like a formal Italian restaurant with white and black table dressings, cloth napkins, and large wine glasses to ensure you can fully enjoy their robust wine list. It is the kind of place that appeals to people of a certain generation as its decor harkens back to the way fine dining used to be, without being inaccessible to those who prefer to dine without a required sports jacket.

**Best for: Bridal parties, baby showers, and family events.**

[Website](https://www.exploretock.com/sushiyoshizumi)

[Open in Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ntL7QpsywH4mVNRt6)

This is a unique option for private dining in San Mateo CA, because a full restaurant buyout only entails filling 9 seats! This authentic omakase experience serving Edomae-style sushi is a one-man operation that has garnered a Michelin Guide recommendation. Chef Akira Yoshizumi utilizes wild-caught fish imported from Japan to serve an authentic, no-frills menu of, in his words, “basically only fish and rice.” This is an experience worthy of only the most distinguished foodies or expats missing the flavors of home.

**Best for: Impressing VIP clients or treating a group of sushi-purists to the best night of their lives.**
