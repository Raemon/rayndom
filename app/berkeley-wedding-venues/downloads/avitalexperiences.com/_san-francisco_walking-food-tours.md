### **“Highly recommend booking a progressive walking tour!”**

Shannon was a great tour guide for our group of ~twenty people. She interacted with everyone and gave fun introductions to the locals and tourist in our group. Highly recommend booking a progressive walking tour!

### **“Best food tour I’ve ever gone on.”**

Best food tour I’ve ever gone on. Nikki was the best tour guide, she made the tour. I loved the stories about North Beach, the foods, the ethic groups, and any other info I wanted. My first time in SF was so memorable and I plan to return and book the Mission food tour.

### **“This was my first food tour and I loved the experience.”**

This was my first food tour and loved the experience. I love to pick up bits of history as I travel and love food from places I cannot get at home. My rule for traveling – no food chains. This was a great way to experience both great food and a little unknown history. Our tour guide Margherita was great!!! Thanks for the experience.
