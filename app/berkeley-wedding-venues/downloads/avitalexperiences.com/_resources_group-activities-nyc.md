Choose between rooms like End of Days B where you play out an apocalyptic scenario, Ultimate Bank Heist where you crack open a safe, or Carbon: 3708 where you get to live out your scifi cyberpunk fantasies.

### Independent Movie Theaters

One of the underrated highlights of the arts and culture scene in New York is the independent cinemas. I’ve spent some of my favorite afternoons and evenings with groups of friends at these theaters. My favorite is [Nitehawk Cinema](https://nitehawkcinema.com/) in Brooklyn, where you can see new releases, old gems, and eat restaurant-quality food while you watch. Cinemaphiles in your group will also appreciate a trip to [IFC](https://www.ifccenter.com/), where you can catch phenomenal foreign films as well as new releases on the festival circuit.

![A guest gets a clue at a Dinner Detective Murder Mystery Dinner](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20660'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![A guest gets a clue at a Dinner Detective Murder Mystery Dinner](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/10.-thedinnerdetective.com_-1024x660.jpeg)thedinnerdetective.com

### Murder Mystery Dinner

If you have a group of amateur sleuths on your hands, an [interactive murder mystery dinner](https://www.thedinnerdetective.com/) may be the perfect activity. Enjoy a delicious meal while uncovering clues, interrogating suspects, and solving a thrilling whodunit.

![Friends do karaoke at RPM in underground in NYC](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20973'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Friends do karaoke at RPM in underground in NYC](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LG5-@rpmunderground-1024x973.jpeg)@rpmunderground

### Karaoke

Karaoke is a very popular late night activity in NYC. Try out [RPM Underground](https://rpmunderground.us/) if you’re in Midtown, [Alligator Lounge](https://www.alligatorloungebrooklyn.com/events) on Fridays if you’re in the Williamsburg area, or book a private room in KTown at a spot like [Karaoke K](https://karaokek.com/) or [Space Karaoke](https://spacekaraoke.com/).

![Thermal pool at Bathhouse in Flatiron](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20562'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Thermal pool at Bathhouse in Flatiron](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/23095_press_bathhouse_10-23-23_17.jpg.webp)abathhouse.com

### Bathhouse Spa and Sauna

If you aren’t European or Asian, you may never have had the experience of going to a Bathhouse, much less with friends or coworkers! But we would argue that’s exactly why you should go out on a limb and book your group a spa day at [Bathhouse](https://www.abathhouse.com/) in Flatiron or Williamsburg. Included in the pricing of your day pass is three different saunas (Dry, Infrared, and Steam), six thermal pools at different temperatures (including a cold plunge!), and unfettered access to their beautiful café and changing rooms. But don’t be afraid to add a massage and a scrub for an up-charge, it’s certainly worth it!
