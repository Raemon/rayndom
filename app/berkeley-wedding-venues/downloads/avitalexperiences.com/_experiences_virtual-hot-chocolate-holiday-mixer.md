FAQ 

Do you provide the ingredients for the hot chocolate? 

This is a **BYO Hot Chocolate Mixer** experience! We provide a comprehensive grocery and Amazon list so each guest can purchase their own ingredients in advance, ensuring the hot chocolate is fully customizable for any dietary needs.

What if I have dietary restrictions? 

No worries! Our list is fully customizable. Whether you’re dairy-free, gluten-free, or sugar-free, you can tailor the ingredients to your preferences.

What if I don’t know my total number of guests? 

That’s okay! Book your event with a deposit for your minimum attendance estimate. Final count due 10 business days prior to event.

Is there time to share our company’s content? 

Yes! Standard run time is 45-60 minutes, with flexibility for up to 10 minutes of your own content. If you need additional time, you can add hosted emcee time at $25 per 15 minutes. Alternatively, you may host on your own platform account (we join for 1 hour before/after your content, no extra staff time charges.)

What if I need a shorter event? 

Our Hot Chocolate Holiday Mixer experience is carefully curated to be a cohesive, energetic experience for your guests and works best when you stick to our well-rehearsed timing. We do our best to accommodate requests for condensed experiences, but want to set your expectations and encourage you to let us do what we do best, in 45-60 minutes.

Can we use our own platform? 

Yes! You are welcome to host on your own account/platform instead of our Avital Zoom if you wish. Our staff is fluent on Google Meet, Zoom, WebEx, and Teams, and must be granted access to Screen Share, Chat, and Mute capabilities. For all other platforms, please inquire about capability and recommendations. Platforms with two-way/group video capabilities are best for this interactive experience.

Can we schedule a rehearsal call? 

All event packages include 15 minutes extra prior to your event start time for any sound checks or tech checks you may need with our Emcee. 

Do I need special tools? 

Nothing fancy! Just a mug and mixing spoon. 

What kind of games will we play? 

Expect light holiday-themed games designed to spark laughter and interaction – nothing too intense, just a fun way to keep the energy festive!
