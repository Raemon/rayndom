Updated March 18, 2025

Hey there, fellow-foodie! Are you looking for a great San Francisco culinary tour but don’t know where to start or who to trust? See below for our curated list of the best San Francisco culinary tours based on reviews, research, and over 14 years in industry.

## Table of Contents

## How we ranked these tours. 

So you don’t have to browse through tons of subpar tours to find the hidden gems, we’ve curated this list to feature only the best of the best. We used three key factors, with a 5-point scale for each, to determine the best culinary tours in San Francisco. 

**Guest Reviews (5 Points)**

We analyzed guest reviews to ensure each tour is highly rated and consistently delivers a quality experience.

**Price-to-Quality Score (5 Points)**

We evaluated whether the experience justifies the cost, considering food quality, portion sizes, and overall value.

**Unique & Exclusive Access** **(5 Points)**

We prioritized tours that offer special experiences like behind-the-scenes access, chef interactions, or hidden gem restaurants that typical tourists wouldn’t find.

## Why trust us?

We’ve been operating[ 5-star food tours in San Francisco](https://avitalexperiences.com/san-francisco/) since 2011. Our team is made up of storytellers and foodies, many of them SF natives, who know the city’s food scene inside and out. We take our guests to hidden gems and avoid tourist traps, ensuring an authentic, high-quality experience. Unlike other tour companies that keep their restaurant partners a secret, we proudly highlight ours—because we know they’re the best of the best.

We, of course, have included a couple of our tours on this list—this is because based on our analysis they truly deserve to be on this list, scoring high marks across the board.

[Start Your Booking](https://avitalexperiences.com/experiences/san-francisco-north-beach-food-tour/#private-booking-form)

[Website](https://avitalexperiences.com/experiences/san-francisco-north-beach-food-tour/)

[Open in Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/y9ptyZVrcEfBPCMQ7)

This North Beach Food Tour, operated by yours truly, highlights the Italian restaurant scene of San Francisco. There’s fresh seafood cioppino paired with a crisp glass of Sauvignon Blanc, delicious pizza from the oldest oven on the west coast, and Award-winning, from-scratch Italian gelatos. Plus, guests will also get a taste of SF’s iconic Chinatown with a dim sum tasting—a great value-add! 

And that’s just the food! The tour is also led by an expert guide which provides rich storytelling and fun tidbits about the neighborhood. For those looking to book this tour as a team building event, there is the option to add on complimentary team building games to the tour to make it extra memorable. 

#### **Guest Reviews – 4.9/5 Points**

Avital has nearly 300 Google reviews with an average star rating of 4.9. Review highlights include **high praise for tour guides** , **great for groups** , **good portion sizes**. [Guest Aziza M.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RHRvDWWufjDtGjVo6) says, “ _Best food tour I’ve ever gone on._ ” We’re blushing! ☺️ 

#### **Price-to-Quality Score – 5/5 Points**

This North Beach Food Tour is $115 without beverage pairings or $150 with beverage pairings. The tour includes at least 4 tastings, including 2 appetizers, 1 entree, and 1 dessert, at 3 different restaurants. The tastings are robust—like a big bowl of fresh Cioppino (seafood stew), wood-fired pizza, and hearty gnocchi pasta. The beverage pairing upgrade includes 3 alcoholic drinks (or high-quality non-alcoholic alternatives). In addition to the food and drink, there are neighborhood stories sprinkled throughout.

#### **Unique & Exclusive Access** Score – **4.4/5 Points**

There are a few highlights that really make this tour standout. First, not only does the tour highlight North Beach, SF’s Little Italy, but guests will also get a taste of Chinatown with a dim sum tasting. Next, for groups that want it, they can add on complimentary team building games, something that the competition is not doing (at least not complimentary). Lastly, the restaurants that this tour visits are some of the best in San Francisco. For example, Sotto Mare, which is a SF institution with over 4,000 5-star reviews. 

#### **Total Score** – **14.3/15 Points**

![medium_large](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Brooke-Porter.-Group-of-Women-cheersing-on-a-corporate-team-building-activity-in-San-Francisco-Mission-District-1.jpg)

### 2\. Best Mission District Food Tour

[Website](https://avitalexperiences.com/experiences/san-francisco-mission-district-food-tour/)

[Open in Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/y9ptyZVrcEfBPCMQ7)

The Mission District Food Tour, another experience from us at Avital, showcases the innovative and trendy restaurants, as well as the classic Latin cuisine that this neighborhood is known for. You’ll stroll through this classic neighborhood, learning about its culinary history and amazing murals. You’ll taste dishes like Peruvian tamales, Tunisian kromb (a grilled cabbage dish with harissa), crispy clam rolls, craft beers, and amazing cocktails. 

Like our North Beach tour, this tour is also led by an expert guide along with optional, complimentary team building games. 

#### **Guest Reviews – 4.9/5 Points**

Avital has nearly 300 Google reviews with an average star rating of 4.9. Review highlights include **high praise for tour guides** , **great for groups** , **good portion sizes**. [Dudy Bar-Tal](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2qZv6PkJdgGhnNhr9) praises this Mission Tour:_“What an incredible experience. Let’s start with Nikki, our amazing tour guide who gave us so much information about The Mission neighborhood, it’s history, and spiced it up with personal childhood stories. The restaurants were a perfect mix with delicious bites and drinks. Avital pays extra attention to gluten free and vegan options. I will remember that Sunday”_

#### **Price-to-Quality Score – 4.5/5 Points**

This Mission Food Tour is $115 without beverage pairings or $150 with beverage pairings. The tour includes at least 4 tastings at 3 different restaurants. We believe in sharing what restaurants we visit publicly on our website (instead of hiding them like a lot of other companies do). We are proud of our restaurants partners because they are truly the best. 

#### **Unique & Exclusive Access** Score –**4.5/5 Points**

This tour doesn’t just visit the hot spots in the Mission that anyone could find with a quick Google search. Instead, we visit places that locals love; places that have incredible food and stories. Again, for groups that want it, we can add on complimentary team building games, something that the competition is not doing (at least not complimentary). 

#### **Total Score** – **13.9/15 Points**

![medium_large](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20720%20480'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![medium_large](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wokwiz-chinatown-tour.jpg)

### 3\. Best Chinatown Food Tour

[Website](https://www.wokwiz.com/tours/i-cant-believe-i-ate-my-way-through-chinatown/)

This Chinatown food tour by Wok Wiz invites guests to experience Chinatown like a local would – wandering through back alleys, popping into markets and stores, getting a cup of tea at a teahouse, and, of course, eating! Wok Wiz has been in business for over 35 years so knows the neighborhood better than almost anyone. The founder, the late Shirley Fong-Torres, even wrote a book titled “The Woman Who Ate Chinatown.” 

#### **Guest Reviews – 4.4/5 Points**

Wok Wiz scores a [4.4 out of 33 Yelp reviews](https://www.yelp.com/biz/wok-wiz-chinatown-walking-tours-san-francisco#reviews). Although they’ve been in business for a long time, they don’t have a strong online presence. But that doesn’t take away from the amazing experiences they provide for their guests on tour. 

#### **Price-to-Quality Score – 3.9/5 Points**

This “I Can’t Believe I Ate My Way Through Chinatown” Food Tour is $95 per person. The price is fair, although most of the tastings are very small little nibbles of things (a fortune cookie, a small pastry, etc.) However the tour concludes with a family-style lunch, so you definitely won’t leave hungry. 

#### **Unique & Exclusive Access** Score – **4.3/5 Points**

Wok Wiz has been in business for over 35 years and was founded by the late chef/author Shirley Fong-Torres. They are experts in all things Chinatown and will take you off the beaten path. They also visit some cool foodie places that aren’t restaurants, like a Chinese deli, a cookware purveyor, and markets. A bonus, this tour can be taken in English or Cantonese! 

#### **Total Score** – **12.6/15 Points**

![medium_large](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20410'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![medium_large](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SF-Japantown-Food-Tour-XD-1459-003_700x410.jpg)

### 4\. Best Japantown Food Tour

[Website](https://edibleexcursions.net/japantown)

[Open in Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EQB3vxG8TUrAzbaT9)

San Francisco’s Japantown is one of only three remaining Japantowns in the US! This neighborhood is bursting with history and amazing restaurants, and Edible Excursions does a fantastic job highlighting it all. Tastings vary by tour but include dishes such as Bento Boxes from a Japanese supermarket, bowls of ramen, onigiri, and matcha soft serve. There are also great cultural stops, like a quick origami lesson at Japanese paper shop. 

#### **Guest Reviews – 4.9/5 Points**

Edible Excursions has a 4.9 rating out of 103 reviews. Reviews tend to highlight the knowledgable guides and how the tour was very filling. 

#### **Price-to-Quality Score – 3.7/5 Points**

This is one of the most expensive culinary tours on our list at $137 per person. However there are many robust tastings, including bento boxes and ramen. Plus there are great stories and cultural stops in addition to just tastings. 

#### **Unique & Exclusive Access** Score – **4.1/5 Points**

Japantown is not as famous as Chinatown, North Beach, or the Mission, so finding resources on your own for great places to eat is a bit more challenging. That’s why a food tour can be highly valuable and we 100% recommend it! 

#### **Total Score** – **12.7/15 Points**

![medium_large](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20768%20432'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![medium_large](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Ferry-Building-Food-Tour-by-Stetchy-Pants--768x432.jpg)

### 5\. Best Ferry Building Food Tour

[Website](https://www.stretchy-pants.com/tours/ferry-building-food-tour/)

[Open in Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xD8zrdpEGWaMrqjNA)

San Francisco’s Japantown is one of only three remaining Japantowns in the US! This neighborhood is bursting with history and amazing restaurants, and Edible Excursions does a fantastic job highlighting it all. Tastings vary by tour but include dishes such as Bento Boxes from a Japanese supermarket, bowls of ramen, onigiri, and matcha soft serve. There are also great cultural stops, like a quick origami lesson at Japanese paper shop. 

#### **Guest Reviews – 5/5 Points**

Stretchy Pants isn’t as well-known as some of the other food tour companies in San Francisco, but they have a growing reputation. They have a 5-star review based on 100+ Google reviews. 

#### **Price-to-Quality Score – 4.1/5 Points**

At $99 per person, this is a more affordable culinary tour than others on the list, and there are 5 tastings included. However, the tastings tend to be smaller and alcoholic drinks are not included. Some of the smaller tastings include mushroom jerky, chocolate, and an Argentinian empanada. But there are also some large tastings, like deep-dish pizza and tacos. 

#### **Unique & Exclusive Access** Score – **3.3/5 Points**

This Ferry Building tour tends to focus on well-known vendors rather than hidden gems. A great option if it’s your first time visiting the iconic landmark, but might feel redundant for locals. 

#### **Total Score** – **12.4/15 Points**

### 6\. Best Cheese-Lover Tour

[Website](https://www.airbnb.com/experiences/2874446?guests=1&adults=1&s=67&unique_share_id=4985ac4f-a969-410b-9390-f3bd97634a27)

Alight, now this tour is something totally different! A tour through California’s countryside to three different dairies. But you’re transported in a motorcycle sidecar! The wind will be blowing through your hair as you ride along the winding roads in the heart of the California cheese scene. In addition to the cheese tastings at the dairies, you’ll also enjoy a picnic lunch in a beautiful setting complete with more cheese, oysters, and wine. 

#### **Guest Reviews – 4.9/5 Points**

This Airbnb Experience from host Jerome has a 4.9 rating out of 17 reviews. Although there are few reviews, they all rave about what a unique and incredible experience it was. 

#### **Price-to-Quality Score – 3.3/5 Points**

This is the most expensive tour on the list at $280 per person. The experience does include three dairy destinations with small tastings at each, plus this unique transportation between them. There’s also a robust picnic at the end including wine. Plus a fresh oyster stop! This tour really focuses on quality over quantity. 

#### **Unique & Exclusive Access** Score – **5/5 Points**

A really unique experience and not something you could do on your own. You’r host will take you’ll get behind-the-scenes access to the dairies, plus more insiders-only moments. 

#### **Total Score** – **13.2/15 Points**

![medium_large](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/napa-valley-wine-tour-3-768x512.jpg)

### 7\. Best Wine Tasting Tour

[Website](https://greendreamtours.com/ultimate-napa-sonoma-wine-tour/)

[Open in Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iz3wJ7Yd32myAa9v9)

When we think culinary tour, wine is a must, especially in California! The Ultimate Wine Tasting Tour from Green Dreams will take you out of San Francisco to visit both Napa and Sonoma. You’ll visit a vineyard in each region, plus lunch at Sonoma Plaza which is amazing on its own! Lunch is not included in the cost of the tour, but the wine tastings are included. 

#### **Guest Reviews – 4.9/5 Points**

Green Dreams is highly rated with 4.9 stars from 200+ reviews on Google. Reviewers comment on how knowledgeable the guides were, plus how easy and seamless the experience was. 

#### **Price-to-Quality Score – 3.5/5 Points**

Food is not included in this $179 tour, which lowers the value, especially for those looking for a true culinary (food and drink) tour. However, we still feel like it’s a fabulous experience for both wine and food lovers. The tour is whopping 9-hours long and you’ll visit both Napa and Sonoma with a tasting at each (that cost is included in the price). 

#### **Unique & Exclusive Access** Score – **4.5/5 Points**

Although you could visit all of the wineries and tasting rooms on your own, Green Dreams does all of the legwork for you so you can just show up and enjoy. Plus transportation is provided so you don’t have to worry about drinking and driving. 

#### **Total Score** – **12.9/15 Points**

![medium_large](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20768%20710'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![medium_large](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/hands-toasting-cocktails-furing-miss-7x7-cocktail-tour-in-san-francisco-768x710.png)

### 8\. Best Cocktail Tour

[Website](https://www.miss7x7.com/tours)

[Open in Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GMcjcQ4gF2wyQxog9)

When we think culinary tour, wine is a must, especially in California! The Ultimate Wine Tasting Tour from Green Dreams will take you out of San Francisco to visit both Napa and Sonoma. You’ll visit a vineyard in each region, plus lunch at Sonoma Plaza which is amazing on its own! Lunch is not included in the cost of the tour, but the wine tastings are included. 

#### **Guest Reviews – 5/5 Points**

Miss 7×7 is newer but has strong initial reviews. A 5-star rating out of 25 Google reviews, most reviewers commenting on the great mix of San Francisco history and the delicious cocktails and mocktails. 

#### **Price-to-Quality Score – 3.6/5 Points**

The price is a bit high for a cocktail tour at $120 per person, but the quality of each drink is very good. There are also small nibbles served along the way, plus gratuity is included which makes it very easy. 

#### **Unique & Exclusive Access** Score – **4.4/5 Points**

Miss 7×7’s cocktail tour visits 3 iconic bars in SF, but what makes it really special is that there is also history and landmark visits sprinkled in between. Many locals comment on how this tour was special for them, even though they’ve lived in the city all their lives.

#### **Total Score** – **13/15 Points**

## **San Francisco Culinary Tour vs. Food Tour?**

You may be wondering, what exactly is a San Francisco culinary tour, and how does it differ from a food tour? In general, the terms can be used interchangeably. However, a food tour typically focuses on tasting great dishes, while a culinary tour often provides a deeper dive into the food and drink culture, including history, techniques, and unique experiences. Most culinary tours in San Francisco highlight a specific neighborhood or cuisine, but the experience varies depending on the tour. These tours are perfect for food lovers who want to truly connect with a city—after all, exploring a culture through its food is one of the most delicious ways to experience it!
