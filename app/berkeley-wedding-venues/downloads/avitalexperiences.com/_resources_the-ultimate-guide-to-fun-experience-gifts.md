#  The Ultimate (Experience) Gift Guide: Fun Experience Gifts for Everyone in Your Life 

July 18, 2022 

The gift giving season can be absolutely overwhelming. Especially if you want to put thought into the gifts you’re giving. Especially especially if you’ve given gifts to the receiver before. There are only so many ties you can buy dad every year! And only so many bouquets of flowers and chocolate you can buy your romantic partner. If you need help thinking outside of the box, go down the route of finding fun experience gifts for your special someone or someones! 

### [![girl-eating-radish-on-a-food-tour](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/fun-experience-gift-food-tasting.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/fun-experience-gift-food-tasting.jpg)

### What Are Fun Experience Gifts?

Experience gift giving is the opposite of material gift giving. What does that mean? It means that what you are giving to someone else is a pass, reservation, or gift certificate to exchange for a particular activity. This activity can be as passive as a massage or progressive meal tour, and as active as a class or even something like skydiving! 

Experience gift giving is an amazing choice if you are giving to the person that “has everything”. But what’s more, fun experience gifts are great for anyone. You just have to find the right experience for your gift recipient.

In the following sections we’ll give you a rundown of some of our favorite and fun experience gifts depending on who you are gifting to. You’ll find great experience gifts for:

  1. **Couples**
  2. **Women**
  3. **Men**
  4. **Kids**
  5. **Groups**



Just remember, think of something your receiver either loves or has never had the chance to do! Experience gifts are for learning, seeing, tasting, or touching something new and, of course, the adventure! 

And, the great thing about these experience gifts in this guide? You can easily find businesses that provide experiences like this all over! Use this list as inspiration or use one of these options directly – you won’t regret it.
