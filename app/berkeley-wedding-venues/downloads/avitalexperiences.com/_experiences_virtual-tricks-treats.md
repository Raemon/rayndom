Virtual Event FAQs 

When do you need our addresses? 

Book first, addresses later! : ) Addresses must be submitted at least 2 weeks prior to your event date to ensure pre-event delivery of your ingredients. Please book your event as soon as you know your date/time, don’t wait for all your RSVPs – your date might sell out!

What if I don’t know my total number of guests? 

That’s okay! Book your event with a deposit for your best estimate. When you submit your final guest list (2 weeks prior to event) you can make the necessary adjustments (max + or – 20% of your original guest count, refunded or charged accordingly)

Can we use our own platform? 

Yes! You are welcome to host on your own account/platform instead of our Avital: Zoom if you wish. Our staff is fluent on Google Meet, Zoom, WebEx, and Teams, and must be granted access to Screen Share, Chat, Spotlight, and Mute capabilities. For all other platforms, please inquire about capability and recommendations. Platforms with two-way/group video capabilities are best for this interactive experience.

What if I have some international guests? 

We have options! Ask your Avital event coordinator which package would be best for you based on your destination countries. Not all experiences ship everywhere, and shipping rates and timelines vary widely. Ask your coordinator right away for the best options.

Will I be notified about tracking? 

Yes! We send tracking information/numbers as soon as we receive them from the shipping carrier. Please contact [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#076e6961684766716e73666b627f7762756e62696462742964686a) with any questions or concerns you may have about tracking for your event, and our team will be happy to help! Our team also tracks your shipments for you and will alert you of any carrier delays and work with you on solutions.

Is there time to share our company’s content? 

Yes! Standard run time if flexible for up to 10 minutes of your own content. If you need additional time, you can add hosted Emcee time at $25 per 15 minutes, or have us join your platform link before/after your longer presentation (no additional event time or charge, we attend only for our standard run time.)

What if I need a shorter event? 

Our experiences are carefully curated to be cohesive, energetic experiences for your guests and work best when you stick to our well-rehearsed timing. We do our best to accommodate requests for condensed experiences, but want to set your expectations and encourage you to let us do what we do best!

Can we schedule a rehearsal call? 

All event packages include 15 minutes extra prior to your event start time for sound checks or tech checks you may need with our Emcee. This is the most accurate time to check true conditions. If you require a longer rehearsal call on another day, ask your coordinator about our Conference-Level package options which come with a rehearsal.

What if I have guests who don’t drink alcohol? 

Choose one of our alcohol-free experiences, or one of our “mocktail friendly” cocktail options so everyone in your group has a great beverage to suit their needs. Ask your curator for suggested options from our seasonal menu.

What if I don’t have a cocktail shaker or tools? 

No problem! We’ll send you a prep sheet in advance that notes common substitute tools. A jar with lid is a great substitute shaker, measuring spoons will sub for a jigger, etc.

Are there legal restrictions on shipping alcohol? 

Yes. Some states legally prohibit the mailing of alcohol. We do our best via a network of partnerships to legally cover as many states as possible compared to other mixology options out there, but there are still a few stickler states.
