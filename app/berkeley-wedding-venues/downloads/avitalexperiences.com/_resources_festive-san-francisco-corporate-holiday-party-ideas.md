You may have done a wine tasting before, but have you ever analyzed the nuances of water? This tasting bar is a great pick for groups with dietary restrictions or those trying to de-center alcohol during their event.

#### [Bitters Blending Bar](https://avitalexperiences.com/experiences/bitters-blending-bar/)

Bitters are an often overlooked component of some of the best cocktails, like an Old Fashioned, Negroni, or a Manhattan. At this interactive bar, you will create your bitters blend to take home and elevate your craft cocktails with.

#### [Popcorn Seasoning Bar](https://avitalexperiences.com/experiences/popcorn-seasoning-bar/)

Take your microwave popcorn to the next level with a Popcorn Seasoning Bar. Your guests will create their perfect popcorn topping with the sweet, savory, and herbaceous options this bar has on offer.

#### [Spiced Nut Mixing Bar](https://avitalexperiences.com/experiences/spiced-nut-mixing-bar/)

Our expert hosts will guide your guests through crafting a delicious spiced nut mix in this creative interactive bar experience. Everyone will leave with a cute branded pouch full of their delicious, nutty, sweet, and spicy creation.

**Why We Love It:** Interactive elements are an easy way to elevate a corporate event. And these have the bonus of giving your guests a gift to take home, which is definitely in the holiday spirit!

### 14\. **Experience a Classic and See the Nutcracker Ballet**

Who wouldn’t love to sit down in a dark theater and see one of the most iconic ballets of all time? Treat your team to an exceptional treat and get them all tickets to see the Nutcracker performed by the [San Francisco Ballet](https://www.sfballet.org/). We think it’s the classiest of our San Francisco corporate holiday party ideas because it immerses your team in the height of culture at one of the most iconic of San Franciscan institutions. This ballet is such a classic it is nearly ubiquitously performed every year at the holiday season by ballet companies.

**Why we love it:** A more refined edge without the need for constant socializing – perfect for art lovers and introverts!

[![people-giving-gifts-at-corporate-holiday-party](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![people-giving-gifts-at-corporate-holiday-party](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/san-francisco-corporate-holiday-party-ideas-white-elephant-party.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/san-francisco-corporate-holiday-party-ideas-white-elephant-party.jpg)

### 15\. **White Elephant Gift Game**

The [White Elephant Game](https://www.whiteelephantrules.com/) is a long storied tradition that has been passed around for over a hundred years now. Something that’s lasted so long HAS to be a hit! For this game everyone brings a gift to the party (or you can provide them if you wish). This is particularly fun if there are some “great” gifts and some “bad” gifts. One at a time, people will open a gift. As you go along, each subsequent person can choose to open an unopened gift, or steal a gift that has already been opened. We don’t know your team but we know this game – a load of bargaining, light hearted enemies, and fun will follow. 

**Why we love it:** This fun and sometimes raucous game will bring your team closer together without the need to go off site.

[![holiday-lights-in-san-francisco](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![holiday-lights-in-san-francisco](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/san-francisco-corporate-holiday-party-ideas-lights-tour.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/san-francisco-corporate-holiday-party-ideas-lights-tour.jpg)

### 16\. **Holiday Lights Tour on a Fire Engine Extravaganza**

[San Francisco Fire Engine Tours](https://www.sanfranciscofireenginetours.com/tours) offers year round tours on their vintage fire engines with singing tour guides and loads of educational information. However, in December, they provide a special tour that focuses on the holiday lights in San Francisco. Let your team sit back and relax as they’re guided around the city in an open air fire engine to let them take in all the sights and lights. We can see them shimmering and shining from here! 

**Why we love it:** Celebrate the season taking in the lights while you sing carols and learn fun facts – how jolly!

![group eating dim sum during san francisco food tour chinatown](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20485'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![group eating dim sum during san francisco food tour chinatown](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/group-eating-dim-sum-during-san-francisco-food-tour-chinatown-1024x485.jpg)

### 17\. **Take a Chinatown Food Tour**

San Francisco is a great city for foodies, so we have a THIRD food tour option for you and your team this holiday season. Our [Chinatown Food Tour](https://avitalexperiences.com/experiences/san-francisco-chinatown-food-tour/) is new, fresh, and incredibly delicious. ‘Tis the season to indulge, and there is no shortage of decadent food on this tour. We enjoy providing our customers with the element of surprise, but to get your mouth watering, some dishes you might have a chance to try on this tour are: shrimp fried rice with black truffle, avocado and salmon egg rolls, or Chocolate Xiao Long Bao. 

More of a DIY type of group? Check out our [Self-Guided Chinatown Food Tour](https://avitalexperiences.com/resources/self-guided-chinatown-food-tour-san-francisco/)!

**Why we love it:** There’s something indulgent about Chinese food, and paired with a nice walk in between restaurants to take in the sights and the crisp Winter air, this is a perfect holiday experience to share with your coworkers.

[![two-women-watching-holiday-movie-at-virtual-corporate-holiday-party](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![two-women-watching-holiday-movie-at-virtual-corporate-holiday-party](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/san-francisco-corporate-holiday-party-ideas-movie-screening.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/san-francisco-corporate-holiday-party-ideas-movie-screening.jpg)

### 18\. **Holiday Movie Screening and Trivia Night**

This is a great option for a remote or in-person event, or a mix depending on your team and their needs! Pick a classic holiday movie and hold a screening, or you can use different online services to create a virtual screening if you’re hosting a virtual event.

Before or after the movie, hold a trivia contest about classic holiday films. You can give out tiered prizes for first, second, and third place winners. And, we think it’s fun and conducive to team building if you split everyone up into teams instead of having them do the trivia game alone. Every man for himself does not foster the holiday spirit!

**Why we love it:** This DIY option is great to create a nostalgic event that lets people cozy up, sit back, and relax.

### 19\. **Hire a Magician to Blow Your Minds**

Brad Barton is a [Bay Area magician](https://www.realitythief.com/) that is “insanely delightful” and a hit at corporate holiday parties and events. His magic is mind blowing and to top it off he’s a hilarious guy. Not only does he perform live, private, in person events, he’ll also do private virtual events if that’s more up your team’s alley. Don’t miss the chance to book him – he gets pretty busy around the holiday times just for this reason! 

**Why we love it:** Watch the impossible made possible with this out of the box holiday party idea.
