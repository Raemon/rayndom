#  18 Luxury Ideas to Celebrate Your 30th Birthday Virtually 

February 15, 2021 

Safely celebrating your 30th birthday during COVID doesn’t mean it can’t be luxurious. In fact, we think that’s even more reason to treat yourself! Whether you’re ordering delivery from an upscale restaurant or splurging on a [private experience with a mixologist](http://avitaltours.com/virtual-birthday-party/), you can still make your 30th birthday feel special. Here are our favorite ways to add some luxury to your 30th birthday, all while keeping it safe. 

[![private dining pod to celebrate 30th birthday during covid](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![private dining pod to celebrate 30th birthday during covid](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/02/30th-birthday-during-covid-restaurant-pod.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/02/30th-birthday-during-covid-restaurant-pod.jpg)Image via Coppa Club Sonning

## **1\. Book a private pod**

For the restaurants and other venues that are lucky enough to have the space, private pods have become a new place for customers to hang out. If you feel comfortable enough to book one of these pods or have a favorite spot nearby, this is a great way to add some luxury to a 30th birthday during covid. Some of these private outdoor pods have cute themes and decorations, making it a really unique experience. 

## **[![virtual cooking class to celebrate 30th birthday during covid](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![virtual cooking class to celebrate 30th birthday during covid](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/02/30th-birthday-during-covid-virtual-cooking-class.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/02/30th-birthday-during-covid-virtual-cooking-class.jpg)  
2\. Hire a private chef**

[Booking a private chef](http://avitaltours.com/virtual-cooking-class/) to walk you through making a creamy risotto or decadent paella laden with seafood is the kind of special birthday energy you want. Luxury is hard to come by during covid, but an award-winning private chef isn’t a bad option. Make it a birthday to remember with this virtual culinary experience. The only thing you need to supply is the birthday cake! 

## **[![woman getting massage to celebrate 30th birthday during covid](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![woman getting massage to celebrate 30th birthday during covid](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/02/30th-birthday-during-covid-massage.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/02/30th-birthday-during-covid-massage.jpg)  
3\. Bring a spa day to your home**

It’s been a while since you’ve had a real spa day, so it’s time to bring the luxury to your home. Splurge on your favorite skincare products, grab a bottle of champagne, and start running the bath — you deserve it. Treat yourself to a day of relaxation. For extra oomph, you can even [hire a masseuse to come to your house](https://www.soothe.com/) for an hour-long massage. If your 30th birthday can’t be the wild one you envisioned, then you should definitely find a reason to be a little extra. 

[![fancy sushi to celebrate 30th birthday during covid](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![fancy sushi to celebrate 30th birthday during covid](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/02/30th-birthday-during-covid-order-fancy-takeout.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/02/30th-birthday-during-covid-order-fancy-takeout.jpg)Image via Omakase, San Francisco

## **4\. Order takeout from an upscale restaurant**

That [sushi bar you’ve been thinking about](http://www.omakasesf.com/our-story) going to or steakhouse across town can still be your birthday meal. Just bring it home! Order all the apps, entrees, and desserts you want. Who knows when you’ll go again? Light some candles and buy some fresh flowers to bring the vibes. And don’t forget to tip well! 

## **[![two women drinking wine while celebrating 30th birthday during covid](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![two women drinking wine while celebrating 30th birthday during covid](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/02/women-pouring-wine-during-virtual-wine-tasting.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/02/women-pouring-wine-during-virtual-wine-tasting.jpg)  
5\. Try a virtual wine tasting**

Again, there’s nothing like an expert giving you devoted attention to make you feel special.

Elevate your virtual happy hour with custom vermouth, the best kind of party gift.

Many musicians and bands are available to hire for private events, adapting to the virtual world. Recreate a night out at your favorite venue by turning the lights down low, making some cocktails, and invite your friends via Zoom to join your concert. The best part is the intimate experience of getting to hang out with the musicians, a luxurious experience not often possible. 

## **[![man making flamed cocktail to celebrate 30th birthday during covid](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![man making flamed cocktail to celebrate 30th birthday during covid](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/02/30th-birthday-during-covid-mixology-class.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/02/30th-birthday-during-covid-mixology-class.jpg)  
7\. Spend some quality time with an expert bartender and cocktail kits delivered**

Instead of fighting for the bartender’s attention, hire a bartender to treat you and your friends to a [special mixology class.](http://avitaltours.com/virtual-birthday-party/) Learn the ins and outs of making cocktails while getting the full attention of your personal mixologist. Ingredients are delivered to each guest so all you need to do is show up and drink up!

Create your own perfume from a kit to really mark the occasion. Give yourself something special to remember your 30th birthday with a customized fragrance.

## [![couple eating lemons during virtual 30th birthday party](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![couple eating lemons during virtual 30th birthday party](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/02/virtual-flavor-tripping-for-virtual-team-building-activities.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/02/virtual-flavor-tripping-for-virtual-team-building-activities.jpg)
