#  An Organizer’s Ultimate Guide to Team Building Activities: Bay Area 

June 24, 2022 

Is it just us or do organizers for team events usually have a thousand balls in the air? Whether you’re an office manager, head of events, or simply have been the one assigned with the task – you probably have a lot of other tasks on your plate. Figuring out fun and engaging team building activities in the bay area isn’t the only thing on your to do list! Let’s make this as painless as possible for you. 

  1. First, we’ll explain exactly what team building activities in the Bay Area are and why they are important. 
  2. Next, we’ll go over a few different types of activities to get you started in the right direction. 
  3. Then? A comprehensive guide of different options that will fit your specific needs.

[![oakland-tour-sf](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Oakland.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Oakland.jpg)

### **What Are Team Building Activities in the Bay Area?**

Team building forges connections between employees. These connections create a sense of camaraderie and accountability between members of your cohort. Teammates want to be successful and collaborative, and not just for their own sakes, but for the sake of the community; to benefit the whole of the team. However, team building activities need to be engaging enough to create these bonds. If your colleagues are sitting around twiddling their thumbs, waiting for the event to be over, that sense of camaraderie might not be created as easily. 

The Bay Area is known for its rich culture and mesmerizing natural beauty. It’s also the center of the tech industry right now. This combination makes San Francisco and its surrounding areas rich with options to entertain and engage your team. The Bay Area has so much to offer and that absolutely includes effective and enjoyable activities for your employees to participate in as a team. 

[![team-of-coworkers-in-icebreaker-event](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![team-of-coworkers-in-icebreaker-event](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/team-icebreaker-kit.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/team-icebreaker-kit.jpg)

### **Why Team Building Activities Are Important Right Now?**

The workforce has changed a lot in the past couple of years. Whether your office is completely remote, halfway there, or hiring more new employees to catch up, team building activities can help forge relationships between colleagues. Especially if they otherwise might not have the opportunity to get to know each other. Getting to know each other is the first step to building professional relationships that foster collaboration, respect, and accountability. Plus, you get the added bonus of showing people that their happiness and quality of life is something management cares about.

That being said, the best activities are ones that are easy to find, easy to organize, and are ones that actually engage and entertain folks. People aren’t going to have lively conversations or laughs if they’re bored to tears! 

### **Here’s what Avital Tour have to say about their team building experience:**

> “Thank you all SO SO SO much for hosting such an incredible event. Each of you made it so much fun and absolutely seamless. The amount of positive feedback following the event was overwhelming.” –Catherine
> 
> “I always feel like I have to run everything and in this case….just sat back and enjoyed the ride. What a talent you have. Already wrote people saying we need to book this event for other groups.” –Kathleen Oliver
> 
> “…as the organizer, this event went as awesome as I would have hoped. well done on your part.” –Laurie B.
> 
> “Avital made me look like a rockstar in front of the team. We had a wonderful time, and it was the perfect end to our time together in NYC. I can’t thank them enough.” –Derek H.
> 
> “Talia and the Avital team were so helpful and easy to work with. Having never set something up like this before, I was not sure what to expect or how to decide. The information provided was so thorough and the team was easily able to address all of my questions and concerns.” –Melissa M.

In this guide you will find an array of team building activities in the Bay Area that might suit your specific needs. However, the most important thing most of all is to choose a trusted company to take care of you. Do your research and find reviews if possible. It is important this event is easy, entertaining, and impressive so you and your team will benefit from it!

### **How To Select The Right Team Building Activity for Your Bay Area Team?**

Figuring out the right style of activity is important. For your first step, choose from one of these three types of events: off-site, on-site, and virtual. This will depend on where your team works, your budget, and any time restrictions you may have. This may sound dull, but starting with this logistical step will help you find your team building activity in the Bay Area that much easier!

#### [![people-smiling-during-a-team-building-activity](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![people-smiling-during-a-team-building-activity](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/off-site-team-building-activities-bay-area.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/off-site-team-building-activities-bay-area.jpg)

## **Off-Site**

An off-site activity is one that happens outside of your office, but in person. Imagine things like walking tours, escape rooms, in person classes at a different location. There are a few advantages and disadvantages to an off-site team building activity. 

**Advantages:** Impress your employees with the effort and financial bandwidth put into an experience outside of the workplace. Plus, an off-site can heighten the sense that this is a social activity for fun; outside of the work place environment people might feel more comfortable getting to know each other personally.

**Disadvantages:** You need to ensure your employees are able to physically get to the off-site location. This can be difficult if some or all of your employees are working remotely. 

#### [![employees-winning-during-an-on-site-team-building-activities-in-the-bay-area](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![employees-winning-during-an-on-site-team-building-activities-in-the-bay-area](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/on-site-events-team-building-activities-in-the-bay-area.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/on-site-events-team-building-activities-in-the-bay-area.jpg)

## **On-Site**

An on-site activity is one that occurs at your workplace – you can let the experience come to you! This can include someone physically coming to your office to host the event, or having a host via video conferencing. Either way, your employees get to quickly come together, take a load off with a fun game or experience, and get to know each other a little better. 

**Advantages:** No transportation necessary for employees working out of the office – the experience comes to you. And thus, no time is wasted. People can pop into a conference room, enjoy the activity, then be on their way! 

**Disadvantages:** There isn’t as much of a wow factor with employees if an experience comes to them. Think of the difference of seeing a clown perform at a kid’s house for a birthday party versus going to the actual circus!

#### [![team-on-video-call-during-team-building-activity](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![team-on-video-call-during-team-building-activity](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/virtual-events-team-building-activities-in-the-bay-area.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/virtual-events-team-building-activities-in-the-bay-area.jpg)

## **Virtual**

Virtual events are great if you have a mix of in person and remote workers and especially if everyone is remote! For a virtual team building activity your host gives you an online meeting location and all the team building magic happens right on your laptop or device. 

**Advantages:** Anyone and everyone can join no matter where they are. As long as you have a device that connects to the internet – you can join this team building activity!

**Disadvantages:** The obvious disadvantage is that connecting over the internet is never quite the same as connecting live and in person. However, we think you’ll be blown away by how impressive some virtual team building events are (and you can read about them below!).

### **Art Class with Painting To Gogh**

This company provides on site, off site, and virtual events. However we think this is best suited for them to come to your organization and have your group do this on site. Then, they can have a great piece of art to take home with them! You even get the choice to have a live art teacher guide you along or if you’d rather use a recording that you can pause and start up again any time you’d like. We like the idea of a live artist to work with so you can ask questions, but we also see the benefit of having a recording so you can pause, take a lunch break, or even start up again the next day. This way it can be completely flexible to your needs. Either way your team will have their creative juices flowing and will have a great memento to keep after the class.
