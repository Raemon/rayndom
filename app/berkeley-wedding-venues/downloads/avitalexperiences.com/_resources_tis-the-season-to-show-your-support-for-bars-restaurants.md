#  ‘Tis The Season To Show Your Support For Bars & Restaurants 

December 18, 2020 

Bars and restaurants are beautiful, culinary retreats to relax and find joy. They’re gathering places for friends, celebration spots for families, and social hubs for solo travelers. They provide not only sustenance, but comfort, happiness, and pleasure. We can’t imagine a world without them.

This holiday season, **consider a gift that helps support bars, restaurants, and the people that make them possible.** We’ve rounded up some fun ways to support bars and restaurants, featuring some of the exciting projects from our chef and bartender partners.

Whether it’s ordering takeout, buying a cookbook, or making a donation, there are so many great (and tasty!) ways to**show your support**.

## ORDER TAKEOUT

_“An Amazon Best Book of the Month,**Drinking the Devil’s Acre: A Love Letter From San Francisco & Her Cocktails** is a smart, delightful mix of barman’s memoir and literary journalism, with layers of spirited history and liquid wisdom. A tender tale of love for delicious drink, and for one’s city, a book for anyone with a passion for history, cocktails, San Francisco, and the wanderlust of travel.”_

_“These 50 cupcakes have a kick! The product of Prohibition Bakery, a downtown hole in the wall, they’re simply the best, the booziest treats in Manhattan. Each diminutive cake is a perfect, delicious balance of texture, flavor, and fragrance. That’s why an astonishing variety of fans, from Food & Wine to Playboy, Newsweek, and Thrillist.com, have come together to heap praise upon bakers Leslie Feinberg and Brooke Siem for their creations. Make a “Dark & Stormy” (Gosling Rum, ginger beer, and lime), an “Old Fashioned” (whiskey, bitters, orange, and a whiskey-soaked cherry), or other cupcake and you’ll become a convert from the very first bite.”_

[The Magic of Tinned Fish by Chris McDade](https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Chris-McDade-ebook/dp/B08GFF5T9H/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_es_US=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=Magic+of+Tinned+Fish&qid=1608244046&s=books&sr=1-1)

_“Tinned fish is one of the world’s great ingredients: brilliantly versatile, harvested and preserved at the peak of its quality and flavor, more economical than fresh seafood will ever be, as healthy and nutrient-packed as food gets. Focusing on sustainable and easy-to-find anchovies, sardines, mackerel, shellfish, and more, here are 75 recipes that will change the way we think about and cook with tinned fish. Whether it’s creating an addictively delicious Spaghetti con le Sarde, transforming a pork roast with a mackerel-based “tonnato” sauce, elevating mac and cheese with crab, or digging into the simplest and best snack ever—anchovies, bread, and butter—cooking with tinned fish is pure magic.”_

[The Craft Cocktail Party by Julie Reiner](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1455581593/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_fabc_wEq3FbS8QSGS6)

_“The New Spanish takes a playful approach to the cuisine of Spain. The authors know the traditions but are mixing up the rules. Don’t look for the same-old tapas and sangria here. Instead you’ll find croquettes made from chickpea flour, a tortilla that swaps butternut squash for the potatoes, asparagus with Marcona almonds_ _, saffron fried rice with bacon and shrimp, and even a blueprint for making your own vermouth from scratch. Normally heavy, stewed meat dishes like duck with sherry and olive sauce get a makeover to be fresher and more intensely flavorful as a result. Seasonal produce shines through.”_
