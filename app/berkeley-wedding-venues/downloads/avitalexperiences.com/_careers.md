## Sales Manager

### A love letter from your future…

Dear Sales Manager,

Does the word “sales” make you cringe? Me too, and yet I have loved this job for over 10 years. Let me explain. 

Avital Experiences isn’t like other companies, and Avital (the human,) isn’t like other company owners or “bosses.” Yes, we have sales goals, ’cause this is a business after all, but we try to hit them by being awesome humans that #BuildAwesomeExperiences. If we’re not hitting them, we #BreatheCuriosity and figure out why, together. #CreateCommunity

Okay – what’s with the hashtags? Those are some of our Core Values, which I know you will love to quote as much as we do, because around here we #EmbraceQuirky – we really live by our core values.

When we first met you, we knew right away you were cut from the same cloth. That adventurous curiosity, love of learning, and desire to work smart so you can feed your life passions at the same time – it all lined up with our company culture and mission. 

The Avital mission is to deepen human connection through interactive food & drink experiences, so of course you’re stoked for this job – you love food and cocktails, you love working with people, and you shine at finding the perfect experience to wow those guests. You’re solid and dependable, detail oriented, smart as a whip, and never back down from a challenge. 

You’ve got the people-skills, creativity, critical thinking chops, and soft-spot for data we were looking for… and you LOVE what we do! You GET IT. 

Sincerely,

Your Predecessor, Corinne
