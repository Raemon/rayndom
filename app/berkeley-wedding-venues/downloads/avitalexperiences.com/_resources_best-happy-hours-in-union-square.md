#  The Best Happy Hours in Union Square 

December 19, 2016 

Is there a happier time than happy hour? With drink and food specials throughout the city, we’re not sure there is. Some of San Francisco’s best bars are in Union Square – a neighborhood not usually frequented by locals but is home to some of our favorites like Bourbon and Branch and Burrit Room + Tavern. Eat and drink well with our guide to the best happy hours in Union Square.

## **The Tonga Room**

[![Tonga Room: The Best Happy Hours in Union Square](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/12/One-The-Best-Happy-Hours-in-Union-Square-is-at-the-Tonga-Room.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/12/One-The-Best-Happy-Hours-in-Union-Square-is-at-the-Tonga-Room.jpg)

**** Is there anywhere better to embrace quirky than The Hurricane Bar in the Tonga Room? The Fairmont Hotel’s pool-turned-tiki-bar is a great place for people watching, dancing to cover bands, and sipping on a Mai Tai underneath a fake rainstorm. On Wednesday through Friday from 5 to 7 pm, enjoy a tropical happy hour with a $15 Appetizer Buffet (with a 1 drink minimum). Enjoy Pacific Rim inspired snacks such as spicy chicken wings, fried rice, edamame, chow mein & spring rolls. Hanging at the Tonga Room is a must-do in SF, and the ambiance makes it one of the best happy hours in Union Square.

## **The European**

[![The European is one of The Best Happy Hours in Union Square](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20640%20480'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![The European is one of The Best Happy Hours in Union Square](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/12/Cheers-to-Happy-Hour-every-weekday-at-The-European-one-of-The-Best-Happy-Hours-in-Union-Square.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/12/Cheers-to-Happy-Hour-every-weekday-at-The-European-one-of-The-Best-Happy-Hours-in-Union-Square.jpg)

Every weekday from 5 to 8 pm, celebrate happy hour at The European with $6 champagne and wine, $7 cocktails like the San Francisco Sour, and large snack selection. Really embrace the whole European thing with a charcuterie board or a cheese plate, or snack lighter with olives, pommes frites, and popcorn. If you’re looking for dinner, try The European’s house ground burger. Or go a little less fancy with a $3 Miller High Life. Not technically European, but we won’t judge.

## **E &O Kitchen and Wine Bar**

[![E&O WIne Bar, just off UnionSquare is The Best Happy Hours in Union Square](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20640%20427'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![E&O WIne Bar, just off UnionSquare is The Best Happy Hours in Union Square](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/12/Drink-Up-at-EO-Wine-Bar-one-of-The-Best-Happy-Hours-in-Union-Square.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/12/Drink-Up-at-EO-Wine-Bar-one-of-The-Best-Happy-Hours-in-Union-Square.jpg)

Six dollar cocktails and glasses of wine and four dollar beers aren’t easy to find in the Bay Area. Luckily E&O Kitchen and Wine Bar has cheap drinks and eats covered during its happy hour, which happens Monday through Saturday from 3-6 pm. Snack on $1 butternut squash dumplings and $1 oysters with kim chee cocktail sauce. If you want to splurge, ahi tuna tartate, naan, Indonesian corn fritters, and pork spare ribs will run you $4 or less. Order a few dishes to hold you over so you can visit some other neighboring bars later.

## **Black Cat**

[![Cocktails and snacks at Black Cat a new Best Happy Hours in Union Square](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%202048%201365'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Cocktails and snacks at Black Cat a new Best Happy Hours in Union Square](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/12/Grab-a-cocktail-and-live-music-at-Black-Cat-home-of-one-of-The-Best-Happy-Hours-in-Union-Square.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/12/Grab-a-cocktail-and-live-music-at-Black-Cat-home-of-one-of-The-Best-Happy-Hours-in-Union-Square.jpg)

From 5:30 to 7:00 every night, the new bar and entertainment salon Black Cat hosts happy hour upstairs. Downstairs, [live music](http://www.blackcatsf.com/#revue) happens every night. Before the music starts, enjoy bites like $2 deviled eggs, $2 Tomales Bay oysters, $5 patatas bravas, and an $8 daily ceviche. Of course, the Black Cat has your cocktail needs covered, too. $8 Martinis, Manhattans, and Hitachio Beers are just a few of their offerings. It’s new, but Black Cat is already one of the best happy hours in Union Square.

## **Tunnel Top**

[![Grab a drink at Tunnel Top, one of The Best Happy Hours in Union Square](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20640%20480'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Grab a drink at Tunnel Top, one of The Best Happy Hours in Union Square](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/12/A-Dive-Bar-Best-Happy-Hours-in-Union-Square-at-Tunnel-Top.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/12/A-Dive-Bar-Best-Happy-Hours-in-Union-Square-at-Tunnel-Top.jpg)

If a semi-dive bar focused on cheap beer is more your happy your scene, then head to Tunnel Top. Located at the top of the Stockton Tunnel, Tunnel Top gives happy hour drinkers $2 off house cocktails, $1 off the beers, and drink specials every day. Get the deals every Monday to Saturday with different happy hour times daily, announced on their Facebook page. DJs arrive at Tunnel Top later in the night, but early on you’ll be able to drink your beer in a dim, divey (but probably crowded) peace.
