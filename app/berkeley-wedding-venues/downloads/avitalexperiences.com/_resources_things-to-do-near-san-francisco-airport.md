## Getting To and From SFO 🚆 

### Public Transit Options

The San Francisco Airport is located 14 miles outside the city proper. But even if you’re staying outside the city, there may be a public transportation option that works for you and your budget!

#### [**BART Rapid Rail**](https://www.flysfo.com/passengers/ground-transportation/public-transit/ride-bart)

The aptly named SFO BART Station leaves you at the International Terminal (you can use the AirTrain to get from there to any Terminal)

#### [**Caltrain Commuter Rail**](https://www.caltrain.com/?active_tab=route_explorer_tab&service=weekend)

This train makes stops between San Francisco and San Jose. You can then transfer at the Millbrae Caltrain Station to the BART

#### **SamTrans Public Bus Service**

Route 292 brings you directly to the airport terminals (making stops at Terminal 2, Terminal 3, and the International Terminal)

Route EX or 142 makes a stop at the SFO rental car lot (after which you can get to your terminal using the AirTrain blue line)

#### **Airporters**

These privately operated buses travel to prearranged stops and take you from there to the airport. They can drop you off at the International Terminal, or Domestic Terminals 2 and 3.

These are the Airporters that come to SFO, and where you can catch them:

  * [Beau Wine Tours](https://www.beauwinetours.com) → Sonoma County and Napa Valley
  * [Groome Transportation](https://groometransportation.com/monterey/?&sd_client_id=f4b7df40-c074-44b1-b735-1226a6122eda) → Sonoma County and Monterey
  * [Wine Country Airporter](https://www.winecountryairporter.com) → Napa Valley
  * [Marin Airporter](https://marinairporter.com) → Marin County



### Rental Cars

SFO has[ rental cars](https://www.flysfo.com/passengers/ground-transportation/rental-cars) onsite that you can pick up when you land and return on your way home. To get to the rental cars from your airport terminal, you can take the AirTrain Blue Line.

### Ride-Share

Uber and Lyft are your friends, as long as you schedule your pickup in advance. These services can get expensive and may be unreliable depending on traffic, so scheduling in advance ensures your price doesn’t go up and your driver arrives promptly on the day.

### Taxis

Taxis are offered at the airport and can be a good option if you aren’t going far. They are located at the Arrivals/Baggage Claim Level of all terminals.

### Drive to the Airport and Park (more on that below)

Be sure to plan transportation ahead of time because rush hour traffic can lead to extreme unforeseen delays.

![man parking car with luggage in hand outside sfo](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20900%20700'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![man parking car with luggage in hand outside sfo](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/man-parking-car-with-luggage-in-hand-outside-sfo.jpg)

## San Francisco Airport Parking 🅿️ 

If you are driving to the airport, be sure to [book parking](https://parking.flysfo.com/book/SFO/Parking) in advance, as it requires a reservation and space is limited. There are five different parking garages to choose from that are conveniently located near stops on the Airtrain Blue Line. You also have the option of choosing between hourly and long-term parking. 

[Long-term Parking](https://www.flysfo.com/passengers/parking/long-term) is the most affordable option with a rate of $4 per minute, capping at a $25 max per 24 hours. They also offer the ability to check your baggage at the garage with SFO’s Remote Bag Check for almost any flight (see details and restrictions [here](https://www.flysfo.com/remote-bag-check)). 

[Domestic/Hourly Parking](https://www.flysfo.com/passengers/parking/domestic-hourly) offers more convenience at a slightly higher max price of $38 per 24 hours. These garages are connected to the center of the airport, which makes them the best choice for those going on a short trip or who have accessibility needs.

![sfo airport terminals](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20900%20700'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![sfo airport terminals](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sfo-airport-terminals.jpg)

## Navigating the SFO Terminals ✈️ 

### Airtrain

Once you arrive at SFO, the [Airtrain](https://www.flysfo.com/passengers/ground-transportation/getting-around-sfo) is your friend! You can easily go between the Terminals to experience the best eats and experiences the airport has to offer.

  * The Red Line: connects all Terminals and garages, as well as the Bart Station and Grand Hyatt at SFO → travels clockwise
  * The Blue Line: connects Long-term Parking, Rental Car Pickup/Dropoff, all terminals, and garages, the BART station, and the Grand Hyatt at SFO → travels counter-clockwise



### Terminals

There are four terminals at SFO → the International Terminal, Terminal 1, Terminal 2, and Terminal 3. As well as seven concourses → A-G. The International Terminal is home to concourses A and G, Terminal 1 has B and C, Terminal 2 has D, and Terminal 3 has E and F. You can check out a the [SFO map](https://www.flysfo.com/maps/static-maps) to get a visual of the airport’s layout.

You can walk between these concourses or take the airtrain for the utmost convenience.

## Accessibility Information at SFO ℹ️ 

### Wheelchairs and Guided Assistance

If you need a wheelchair at the airport, your airline will be the point person to contact when arranging this service. Your airline is required to assist you

  * From the terminal entrance to the departure gate
  * Through security, and up until you board your seat
  * From your plane seat to any connecting flights you have on your itinerary
  * From your arrival gate to the terminal exit or vehicle pickup area



SFO has ramps in all terminals and concourses.

### TTY/VRS

This phone service is offered for patrons who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. It can be found in every terminal and is free when calling 48 states. [See exclusions](https://www.flysfo.com/passengers/services-amenities/accessibility/at-sfo).

### [Sensory Rooms](https://www.flysfo.com/passengers/services/sensory-room)

While open to all guests, these rooms were designed with neurodivergent travelers in mind. There are three spaces to explore, a quiet space to decompress from the overstimulating sights and sounds of the airport, an active area where you can play with regulating sensory objects, and the “Cabin Experience” where you can sit in a model airplane to practice for your flight and work through your flying anxiety.

### Service Animals

Your certified furry friends are welcome at SFO! This airport has multiple “[animal relief areas](https://www.flysfo.com/passengers/services/traveling-with-pets)” where your pet can do its business or get some water. These areas are also completely accessible for travelers using wheelchairs or other accessibility devices. The TSA website breaks down [how to register your service animal](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/tsa-cares?field_disability_type_value=10) before your flight.

Terminal 3

#### [Black Point Cafe](https://www.flysfo.com/passengers/shop-dine-relax/black-point-cafe)

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2040%2040'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/location-icon.svg)

Terminal 1

#### [Peet’s Coffee & Tea](https://www.peets.com)

### Best Lunch and Dinner Spots 🥗 

#### [Bun Mee](https://bunmee.co/san-francisco-international-airport-terminal-1)

Recommendation: Enjoy a heart-warming bowl of pho or a flavorful banh mi here. And if it’s breakfast you’re looking to grab, their Breakfast Bulgogi Bun is incomparable!

Vietnamese

#### [Starbird](https://www.starbirdchicken.com/starbird-chicken-menu)

Recommendation: This place is a favorite of those from the Bay Area. The most popular dish is their classic chicken sandwich, and there are many zesty sauces you can add to customize your order.

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2040%2040'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/location-icon.svg)

Chicken

#### [Mama Go’s](https://mamagos.com)

Recommendation: Mama Go’s is the first-ever Filipino restaurant in a US airport! This is a good spot if you’re traveling with anyone with dietary restrictions, because they have adapted many of their classic dishes to be vegan and gluten-free. If you have never tried this cuisine we recommend the Garlic Fried Rice with Longanisa Sausage or the Lumpia (Filipino egg rolls with pork and veggies).

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2040%2040'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/location-icon.svg)

Filipino

#### [Tomokazu](https://www.tomokazujapanesecuisine.com/menus)

Recommendation: If you have the time for a nice sit-down meal, this place is a great choice. They specialize in sushi, ngiri, and noodles, at a price point that won’t break the bank. And if you don’t have the time to sit down for your flight, you can always grab a premade sushi platter!

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2040%2040'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/location-icon.svg)

International Terminal G

Japanese

#### [Cat Cora](https://catcora.com)

Recommendation: This is a great sit-down dinner option for those wishing for a break from the airport atmosphere. There are big TVs where you can watch the game, and reviewers consistently compliment the service they received. Ordering the Chef’s Burger and a pint (or two) is a perfect way to unwind.

  * Terminal 1: 49 Mile Market (C2) Dogpatch Bakehouse & Cafe (C7), Dolores Park Cafe (C5) Little Skillet (C6)
  * Terminal 2: Andale (D16), Burger Joint (D15), Napa Farms Market (D Gates)

## History of SFO Airport 📖

**1927:** Mills Field Municipal Airport opened. It was barely more than an airstrip in a cow pasture.

**1930:** The city of San Francisco purchased more land in the area in order to make the airport a permanent fixture.

**1931:** The airport is renamed and became the San Francisco Airport.

**1935:** Pan American Airways started operating out of SFO. This was the first recurring scheduled flight by seaplane over the ocean. The route goes from SFO to Asia.

**SFO During World War II:** The war required the airport to become an Army training corps and a Coast Guard Base. 

**SFO Post-War:** Passenger traffic boomed when airport activities returned to normal. The airport saw 1 million passengers pass through in the year 1947 alone.

**1954:** SFO opened its “Central Terminal,” which we know today as Terminal 2.

**1959:** The airport claimed another “first.” They installed the first working Jet bridges in the USA and started to offer commercial Jet services to the public.

**1960s:** The first iteration of Terminal 1 was built. It would be expanded upon and revamped in the decades to come as traffic at the airport increased exponentially.

**1970-1980:** Terminal 3 is added. Terminal 1 and 2 received their first revisions and upgrades since opening. The Airport Commission created the SFO Museum during this period.

**1990:** The airport planned a massive expansion and renovation. The plans faced significant environmental and political opposition, which prolonged the timeline. These updates would not occur until the new millennium.

**2000s:** Plans for expansion would finally see success. The International Terminal was added, and an automated shuttle was created between the Terminals. Public transit options to get to SFO massively improve with a stop added on the BART that takes you right to the station.

**2010-Today:** The International Terminal opened in late 2000 at a cost of 2.4 billion dollars. In 2012, the airport began constructing a new control tower, which was completed in 2016. Terminal 1 began a massive overhaul to transform it into the Harvey Milk Terminal 1 as it is known today. The first section of the new terminal would open in 2019, and it would see completion in 2024.
