### 1\. Walking Food Tour

Take in the sights, tastes, and history of the [East Village](https://avitalexperiences.com/experiences/new-york-city-east-village-food-tour/) and [Flatiron](https://avitalexperiences.com/experiences/new-york-city-flatiron-food-tour/) on our walking food tours!

### 2\. Friday Night at the Met

It’s always a treat to walk around the Met and take in the staggering collection of art, sculpture, and architecture on offer, but did you know [the Met has extended hours Friday nights](https://www.metmuseum.org/events/programs/met-fridays)? Take advantage of the museum’s late night offerings by taking your team to an exhibition, a concert, a drawing class, or simply to sip cocktails and wander around looking at the art until 9pm on a Friday!

### 3\. Chocolate Making Class

Everyone loves a bit of chocolate–and if you don’t, then maybe you just need to make your own! Try taking on a chocolate-making class at [Voilà Chocolate](http://voila-chocolat.com/#band-section). Each event will be in a private room and include a dedicated chocolatier to lead the session, while catering, alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages are all available to add-on to your experience!

### 4\. Escape Room

Escape rooms bring together all the benefits of team building. While in the room together, you are all forced to communicate, solve problems, and build trust in each other’s abilities. With [Escape Room Team Building](https://theescapegame.com/newyorkcity/team-building/), you have your choice of theme.

There are not many things that are more New York than a good ‘ole slice of pizza. Your team will have a blast taking a class at [Pizza School NYC](https://pizzaschool.com/private/)! You’ll all enjoy some yummy ‘za before even making your own, and I can almost guarantee they’ll be begging you to go back again. It’s a great way to build a rapport with your team while distracting them with good eats.

### 6\. Jet Ski Tour

See what I did there? Sea the City’s [Jet Ski Tours](https://www.seathecity.com/jetski-tours/corporate-events/) are a unique way to bring your team together for a once-in-a-lifetime experience. You’ll see Manhattan, Ellis Island, the Statue of Liberty, and other significant landmarks from a new perspective on that jet ski. You won’t be alone – there will be a professional with you to guide you through the process and make sure everyone is safe.

In these classes, participants learn the art of woodworking, utilizing various tools and techniques to create their own wooden projects. This is a great option if you’re looking for NYC suburb team building activities, as their studios are in Union City.

### 12\. Candle Making Class

Award-winning fragrances and eco-friendly wax come together with trivia, upbeat music, and beverages, resulting in a unique and [interactive team building experience](https://www.rewaxandunwineevents.com/corporate-events).

_Such a fun experience! Went here for a team bonding event and would absolutely do it again. The staff was so helpful in picking from the multitude of scents. It was great creating something of my own while talking to my coworkers about non-work things! And wine. Wine is always a great addition.[-Katherine S. via Google](https://goo.gl/maps/ktu25yudGz4AwbRE6)_

### 13\. Immersive Video Game Experience

[Beat the Bomb](https://beatthebomb.com/brooklyn) brings video games into the real world with their 1-hour missions, where you and your team will suit up in hazmat gear and crack codes to beat the “Bomb” (a huge cannon shooting out colorful foam.) This is an exciting experience that combines structured problem solving with unstructured time to chat, laugh, and connect.

_We hosted our corporate Q2 event here and everyone had a blast! Leading up to the event, staff was very responsive through email and answered all of my questions promptly. Upon arriving to the event, we were brought to our private room almost immediately and started gearing up the teams to enter each room. Avery and Jagger were so attentive and nice. We had a great time joking around with them and taking photos. They were just so nice and pleasant to be around. They let us be goofy and loud and truly enjoy ourselves 🙂 A great experience and highly recommend!!! –_[ _Amelia via Google_](https://g.co/kgs/NDVgEC)

## Best NYC Team Building Activities for Medium Groups (10-40 Guests)

New York has so many incredible team activities for medium size groups. 10-40 guests is the sweet spot for [Interactive Meals](https://avitalexperiences.com/tag/interactive-meal/) and sporting events. 

### 14\. Interactive Meal

An Interactive Meal with Avital is a fun and [interactive dining experience in NYC](https://avitalexperiences.com/experiences/new-york-city-interactive-meal/) that’s lighter than a cooking class and more exciting than just reserving a table at a restaurant. Guests will enjoy drinks, amuse bouches, appetizers, and craft their own cocktails with a mixologist. Then, they’ll be seated for a delicious entrée with beverage pairing, participate in food and drink trivia, and end with dessert followed by a unique flavor experience. It’s a great way to engage with your group while enjoying delicious food and drinks.

_Excellent food and excellent company! Yasmin was amazing! Did this as a team building and dinner event, and everyone thoroughly enjoyed 🙂 –[Gabrielle C. via Google](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CSGcByF7KAZfAhiF7)_

### **15\. Unarthodox Art Event**

[Unarthodox](https://www.unarthodox.com/team-building-group-outing) uses art to connect groups in cool, immersive ways. Choose from 7 of their experiences, like “Sculpture Without Sight” or a collaborative mural painting. Each experience is designed to be interactive and approachable for all guests, whether you have a team of introverts, extroverts, VIPs, interns, and everything in between. All supplies and staff are included, plus a full photo and video package for groups of 12+. If you’d like to add on food or drinks, there are several packages to choose from. 

_We hired Unartodox for a corporate event that went perfectly. Unartodox came to our location and ensured us that it would not only be a fun experience but also not messy. We did the ‘A Night with Picasso’ class which was a great fit as everyone had the opportunity to make their work their own based on how they interpreted the instructions. Overall we are very happy and cannot wait to host another event with the team![From Caroline K. via Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/biz/unarthodox-new-york?hrid=RYUeQwbHPnxJyFgK21rS4Q&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=\(direct\))_

### 20\. Karaoke Outing 

This is not your average karaoke party where you’re all stuck in a dark room and taking turns in the spotlight. [Expressway Music](https://expresswaymusic.com/corporate-events-dj/) has lots of experience with the sound, so they will be sure to make you sound like Celine Dion–as much as possible. This is an excellent way to get everyone out of their shells, have some fun, and create unique memories in the process.

### 29\. Go to a Ballgame 

Even if your corporate team can’t agree on a sports team, a night at the stadium is still a great way to bond. Book a [block of seats](https://www.mlb.com/yankees/tickets/group-tickets) or a box so you can all enjoy the game together.

### 32\. Go to Governors Island

New Yorkers tend to forget that [Governor’s Island](https://www.govisland.com) is only a short $5 ferry-ride away.
