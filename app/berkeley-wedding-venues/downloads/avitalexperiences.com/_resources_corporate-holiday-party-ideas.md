## **Giving Back Company Holiday Party Ideas**

Charitable activities during holiday celebrations align with seasonal values of giving while creating meaningful team building experiences. These activities often generate stronger emotional connections and lasting satisfaction than traditional party activities alone.

### Volunteer Days

Volunteer days at local soup kitchens or homeless shelters provide direct community service opportunities that create shared purpose and perspective. Coordinating group volunteer sessions during work hours demonstrates company commitment to community while providing team members opportunities to work together outside normal job functions. These experiences often strengthen workplace relationships through shared meaningful work.

### Toy Drive

Toy drive competitions between departments with donation goals create friendly competition while supporting community needs. Clear guidelines about appropriate toys, age ranges, and donation deadlines ensure successful collection while department-based competition encourages team participation and internal motivation. Recognition for winning departments adds incentive while maintaining focus on charitable outcomes.

### Food Bank

Food bank collection drives with friendly competition for most items donated combine team building with community support. Weight-based or item-count competitions between teams or departments encourage participation while addressing real community needs. Educational components about local food insecurity can increase employee engagement and understanding of community impact.

### Angel Tree Adoption

Angel tree adoption programs supporting families in need during holidays create personal connections between employees and specific community members. Coordinating adoption of multiple families allows for team-based gift purchasing and wrapping activities, creating opportunities for collaboration while directly impacting individual families’ holiday experiences.

### Charity Fundraiser Raffle

Charity fundraiser raffles with prizes donated by local businesses combine entertainment with fundraising while building community business relationships. Local business donations for raffle prizes create networking opportunities while raffle ticket sales during parties add excitement and anticipation. Clear communication about benefiting charities ensures employee comfort with participation.

## **Corporate Holiday Party Themes**

Themes elevate company holiday celebrations, creating unique experiences that your group will remember for the entire year. These innovative [holiday party themes for work](https://avitalexperiences.com/resources/holiday-party-themes-for-work/) help companies distinguish their celebrations and create memorable experiences that employees discuss long after the event.

### Winter Wonderland 

A winter wonderland theme transforms any venue into a magical holiday escape with white decorations, snowflakes, and silver accents. This classic approach works beautifully in office spaces, creating an immersive environment with artificial snow, twinkling lights, and crystalline decorations. The color palette of whites, silvers, and light blues creates an elegant atmosphere that photographs beautifully and appeals to diverse tastes.

### Classic Christmas

Classic Christmas celebrations embrace traditional red and green colors, wreaths, and twinkling lights to create warmth and nostalgia. This approach works particularly well for companies with strong holiday traditions, incorporating elements like Christmas trees, garland, poinsettias, and classic holiday music. The familiarity of these elements helps employees immediately feel the festive atmosphere and encourages participation.

![ugly christams sweaters for holiday party themes for work](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![ugly christams sweaters for holiday party themes for work](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/corporate-holiday-party-themes-cozy-sweater.jpg)

### Ugly Sweater Contest

Ugly sweater contests encourage festive fashion and friendly competition while maintaining a lighthearted atmosphere. This theme works exceptionally well for casual workplace cultures, encouraging creativity and humor while providing natural conversation starters. Judging categories can include “Most Creative,” “Funniest,” and “Most Festive,” with prizes adding excitement to the competition.

### Holidays Around the World

Holiday Around the World celebrations embrace diverse cultural traditions, making the party more inclusive for multicultural teams. This theme allows employees to share their cultural holiday traditions through food, decorations, music, and customs, creating educational opportunities and fostering appreciation for diversity within the workplace.

### Vintage Holidays

Vintage holiday themes featuring retro decorations from the 1950s or 1960s add nostalgic charm with classic ornaments, vintage advertisements, and period-appropriate music. This approach creates unique photo opportunities and conversation pieces while offering a fresh take on traditional holiday aesthetics.

### Starlight Speakeasy

Give your holiday celebration a Prohibition-era edge with hidden “password-only” entry, jazz music, and wintery craft cocktails. Décor can combine dark jewel tones, candlelight, and art deco touches for an intimate yet dazzling feel.

### Après-Ski Chalet

Channel alpine luxury without leaving the city. Faux-fur throws, twinkling lanterns, and hot toddy stations set the mood. Serve fondue, mini raclette plates, and gourmet s’mores made tableside. Guests can wear chic ski lodge attire — think cozy knits meets champagne flutes.

### Masquerade Ball

Masquerade ball themes combine elegance with mystery, featuring sophisticated masks and a refined holiday atmosphere. This concept encourages employees to dress formally while providing conversation starters through the intrigue of partial anonymity. Elegant masks can be provided as party favors, and the formal atmosphere elevates the entire celebration to feel more like a special occasion than a typical office party.

### Hollywood Glam Night

Hollywood glam themes feature gold decorations and red carpet entrances, making employees feel like celebrities for the evening. This approach works particularly well in upscale venues, with gold and black color schemes, dramatic lighting, and professional photography creating an atmosphere of luxury and appreciation. A red carpet entrance with photo opportunities sets the tone immediately upon arrival.

### Tropical Holiday Escape

Tropical holiday themes offer an escape from winter with Hawaiian shirts and summer vibes, providing a refreshing alternative to traditional winter celebrations. This unexpected approach works especially well in cold climates, featuring bright colors, tropical flowers, summer cocktails, and beach-themed decorations that create a fun, relaxed atmosphere encouraging mingling and conversation.

### Murder Mystery Dinner

Murder mystery dinner themes combine entertainment with festive dining, engaging employees in interactive storytelling throughout the evening. Professional mystery dinner companies can provide characters, scripts, and coordination, or creative teams can develop their own holiday-themed mysteries. This format encourages participation, teamwork, and provides natural conversation topics throughout the event.

### Black-Tie Gala

Gala night themes featuring black-tie attire and upscale venue atmosphere create special occasions that employees anticipate and remember. This sophisticated approach works well for larger companies or special anniversary years, requiring formal venues but creating an atmosphere of celebration and achievement that reinforces company success and employee value.

![gift exchange in the office for work holiday party](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20900%20700'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![gift exchange in the office for work holiday party](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/gift-exchange-in-the-office-for-work-holiday-party.jpg)

## Corporate Holiday Party Gift Ideas

We all know the season isn’t about receiving gifts. BUT, some thoughtful, curated gifts never hurt anybody. Plus, they’re a great way to show appreciation. Whether you’re sending [holiday party kits](https://avitalexperiences.com/resources/best-holiday-party-kits/) or organizing a gift exchange, here are our top picks for all comfort levels and budgets. 

### Secret Santa

Secret Santa exchanges with $25 budget limits and optional theme guidelines provide structure while maintaining surprise elements. Clear guidelines about appropriate gifts, spending limits, and participation requirements ensure everyone feels comfortable participating. Optional themes like “locally made items” or “books and experiences” can add creativity while maintaining budget consciousness.

### White Elephant Gift Exchange 

White elephant gift exchanges featuring quirky and humorous gift selections create entertainment through strategic choosing and “stealing” of wrapped presents. These exchanges work best with clear rules about gift values, stealing limits, and appropriate humor levels. The entertainment value often exceeds the actual gifts, making this format particularly suitable for teams that enjoy playful competition.

### Personalized Gift Cards

Personalized gift cards from local restaurants or popular retailers allow recipients to choose items they actually want while supporting local businesses. Coordination with local establishments can sometimes yield group discounts or special promotions, adding value while building community connections. This approach works well for diverse teams with varying interests and preferences.

### Charity Donations 

Charity gift giving supporting local food banks or toy drives transforms gift exchanges into community service opportunities. Departments or teams can compete to collect the most donations, while individual contributions replace traditional gift exchanges. This approach aligns with many employees’ holiday values while creating positive community impact and team building through shared purpose.

### Actually Cool Company Swag

Company swag exchanges featuring branded items and custom merchandise can supplement other gift activities while building company pride. High-quality branded items like fleece jackets, water bottles, or tech accessories feel more valuable than typical promotional items and create ongoing brand visibility. Custom items commemorating the specific year or event become lasting mementos.

### ​​Experience Vouchers

Give the gift of memories instead of just “stuff.” An experience voucher can be tailored to your team’s shared interests or each individual’s personal passions. Think private wine tastings, immersive art exhibits, live theater, or gourmet cooking classes. 

![mulled wine holiday party kit](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![mulled wine holiday party kit](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/mulled-wine-holiday-party-kit.jpg)

### Monthly Subscriptions

A well-chosen subscription turns a one-day holiday gift into a year-round delight. Skip the generic and go for something that reflects your company’s personality. Or better yet, your team’s quirks. Some quirky ideas include, a [pickle of the month club](https://picklelicious.com/collections/pickles-of-the-month-packs?srsltid=AfmBOoojiyc4pNB-HTGnxk2Houn6lYrbtcliZBCjmIndNYa22C6iV6qc), [mystery tackle box](https://mysterytacklebox.com/), and even an [undies of the month club](https://www.meundies.com/membership)! The best subscriptions are curated, high-quality, and feel like a gift that keeps whispering “we appreciate you” long after the party’s over. Here are even more [weird gift basket ideas](https://avitalexperiences.com/resources/weird-holiday-gift-baskets/). 

### Holiday Bonuses, duh!

A thoughtful end-of-year bonus can be the most appreciated gift of all. Present them in a memorable way — tucked into a custom holiday card, inside a mini ornament, or revealed via a fun team game. Pair with a handwritten note of appreciation for a personal touch.

## **Tips to Organize Your Corporate Holiday Party**

At Avital, we’re experts in planning memorable experiences that are anything but boring. From venue selection to timeline and making it inclusive, here are our top tips for organizing your office party. 

### Venue Selection & Atmosphere

**Venue selection** significantly impacts party atmosphere, logistics, and overall success. The right venue enhances theme execution while providing practical functionality for planned activities and expected attendance levels.

**On-site office** transformations with decorations and lighting changes offer cost-effective solutions while utilizing familiar spaces in new ways. Strategic lighting, temporary decorations, and furniture rearrangement can dramatically change office atmospheres while maintaining convenience for setup and cleanup. This approach works particularly well for budget-conscious celebrations or companies with attractive office spaces.

**Hotel ballroom rentals** provide elegant formal celebration spaces with professional catering services and established event coordination. These venues offer sophisticated atmospheres suitable for formal themes while providing parking, accessibility, and climate control that ensure guest comfort. Professional venues also typically include liability insurance and safety features that reduce organizational risk.

**Restaurant private dining rooms** offer intimate team gathering spaces with professional food service and established ambiance. Many restaurants provide private dining options that include preset menus, dedicated service staff, and atmospheric lighting that creates special occasion feelings without extensive decoration requirements. This option works well for smaller teams or companies preferring dining-focused celebrations.

**Event halls** with catering services and entertainment options provide flexible spaces that accommodate various party sizes and themes. Dedicated event venues often include sound systems, lighting options, and layout flexibility that support different activity types while providing professional coordination services. These venues typically offer package deals that simplify planning while controlling costs.

**Outdoor venues** with heating for winter wonderland themes create unique atmospheric opportunities despite seasonal weather challenges. Heated tents, outdoor heaters, and seasonal decorations can transform outdoor spaces into magical winter settings while providing memorable experiences that differentiate celebrations from typical indoor events. Weather contingency planning becomes essential for outdoor winter events.

**Rooftop spaces** offering city views and unique atmosphere provide distinctive celebration settings that create lasting visual memories. Urban rooftop venues often include existing lighting and architectural features that enhance party atmospheres while providing distinctive photo opportunities. Access, weather protection, and safety considerations require careful evaluation for rooftop venue selection.

### Planning Timeline & Organization

Successful company holiday parties require systematic planning that begins months in advance and addresses logistics, coordination, and contingency planning. Proper timeline management ensures optimal vendor availability, venue selection, and employee participation while preventing last-minute stress and oversights.

#### **August or September**

**Starting planning 3-4 months ahead** ensures access to preferred venues and vendors during peak holiday season demand. Early planning also allows for better price negotiations and vendor selection while providing adequate time for employee input and feedback incorporation. Popular venues and entertainment options book quickly during holiday seasons, making early reservations essential for optimal choices.

#### **Mid-October**

**Sending save-the-date notifications** by October 15th for December events allows employees to plan personal schedules while providing preliminary party information. Early communication demonstrates organizational commitment while allowing employees to arrange childcare, transportation, or other personal logistics. Save-the-date notices can include basic information while detailed invitations follow later with complete party information.

#### **Early November**

**Finalizing guest counts and dietary restrictions** by November 1st provides adequate time for catering arrangements and venue capacity confirmation. Accurate attendance numbers ensure appropriate food quantities and venue arrangements while dietary restriction information allows for inclusive menu planning. Digital RSVP systems can streamline information collection while providing organized tracking capabilities.

#### **1 Week Before Event**

**Confirming all vendors and details one week before event dates** prevents last-minute complications while ensuring everyone understands expectations and deliverables. Final confirmations should include delivery times, setup requirements, contact information, and contingency communication plans. Written confirmations provide documentation while demonstrating professional organization.

### Making It Inclusive and Memorable

Creating truly inclusive office holiday parties requires intentional planning that considers diverse employee backgrounds, comfort levels, and accessibility needs while ensuring everyone feels welcomed and valued. Memorable celebrations result from thoughtful details that demonstrate genuine appreciation for employee contributions and individual preferences.

**Surveying employees about preferences and accessibility needs** provides essential planning information while demonstrating organizational commitment to inclusive celebration. Anonymous surveys can gather input about dietary restrictions, music preferences, accessibility requirements, and activity interests while allowing employees to provide suggestions and feedback. Survey results should directly influence planning decisions and party execution.

**Offering multiple date options** accommodates different schedule constraints including family obligations, religious observances, and personal commitments. Multiple celebration options might include lunch events, evening parties, or weekend gatherings that provide participation opportunities for employees with varying availability. Flexible scheduling demonstrates respect for work-life balance while maximizing participation opportunities.

**Including non-alcoholic beverage options** and dietary alternatives ensures everyone can fully participate in refreshment offerings regardless of personal preferences or restrictions. Quality non-alcoholic alternatives should receive equal attention and presentation as alcoholic options while dietary alternatives should feel like desirable choices rather than afterthoughts. Clear labeling helps employees make informed choices while preventing accidental consumption issues.

**Recognizing achievements and milestones** from the past year creates personal connection and demonstrates organizational awareness of individual contributions. Recognition can include work anniversaries, promotions, project completions, or personal achievements that employees choose to share. Public recognition during celebrations reinforces appreciation while creating positive memories associated with workplace success.

**Creating photo opportunities and lasting mementos** from office holiday parties provides tangible reminders of positive workplace experiences while generating content for company communications. Professional photography, themed photo booths, or DIY photo stations encourage memory creation while commemorative items like ornaments, photo frames, or company-branded keepsakes extend celebration impact beyond the actual event.

**Following up with thank you messages and feedback** **collection** demonstrates continued appreciation while providing valuable information for future celebration planning. Thank you communications can include event photos, appreciation for specific contributions, or preview information about upcoming company events. Feedback collection helps identify successful elements and improvement opportunities while showing organizational commitment to continuous enhancement.

## **Why Company Holiday Parties Matter**

A **company holiday party** isn’t just a date on the calendar, it’s a strategic tool. [Research consistently shows that well-planned holiday parties increase job satisfaction and employee retention through meaningful recognition](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-27473-y#Sec17). Benefits include: 

  * Boosting morale and retention
  * Strengthening cross-team relationships
  * Showing authentic appreciation
  * Creating shared memories that fuel company culture year-round



When done right, your corporate holiday party sets the tone for the new year. Recognition given over a glass of wine and great food lands differently than a line on a performance review. It’s warmer, more human, and way more fun.
