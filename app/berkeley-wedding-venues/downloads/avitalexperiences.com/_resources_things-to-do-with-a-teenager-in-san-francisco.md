![medium_large](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/8.-gggp.org_-768x632.jpg)

Whether you are visiting San Francisco for the first time, or you’re looking to spend a fun weekend in town as a local, this guide will help you craft the perfect itinerary of the best things to do in San Francisco with a teenager.

We’ve got the inside scoop on how to keep a teenager entertained, from taking them on a [San Francisco food tour](https://avitalexperiences.com/san-francisco/), to spending the day at the iconic Pier 39. This list will give you all the inspiration you need when it comes to finding things to do with teens in San Francisco.

## A few of our favorite things to do in San Francisco with teenagers:

  * Book a [walking food tour](https://avitalexperiences.com/san-francisco/) and enjoy great eats while hearing stories about the city
  * Take in the beautiful views on and around the Golden Gate Bridge
  * Enjoy the endless entertainment offered at Pier 39
  * Create photo ops while boating over the beautiful bay



## In this post, you’ll find:

  * Fun activities for you and your teen in San Francisco
  * Ideas for outings that are fun for the whole family
  * Things to do during Spring and Summer Break in San Francisco with teens
  * Activities perfect for teens who enjoy food, amusement parks, museums, art, and athletics



## 1\. Take a Walking Food Tour in North Beach

![group standing in front of cavalli cafe during north beach food tour](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20485%201024'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![group standing in front of cavalli cafe during north beach food tour](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/group-standing-in-front-of-cavali-cafe-during-north-beach-food-tour-485x1024.jpg)

A great food tour can connect you straight to the beating heart of a historical city like San Francisco. Good food is a pleasure shared by people of all ages, and Avital Food & Drink Experience’s philosophy is that there’s no better way to connect than through a great meal with a great story. 

We offer a [North Beach food tour](https://avitalexperiences.com/experiences/san-francisco-north-beach-food-tour/), which is perfect for lovers of Italian Food. You will learn about the exciting origins of the Barbary Coast during the Gold Rush, eat at four incredible restaurants, and take in the sights and sounds of North Beach. There’s even a Chinatown stop to experience two incredible neighborhoods in one.

These tours are a unique experience filled with delicious bites and many moments for conversation and connection, which will keep your teen engaged and satiated!

## 2\. Experience the Exploratorium

![eyeballs in a spiral during experiment at the exploratorium, one of the best places to visit with teens in san francisco](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20960%20916'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![eyeballs in a spiral during experiment at the exploratorium, one of the best places to visit with teens in san francisco](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2.-exploratorium.edu_.jpg)Image Credit: exploratorium.edu

Museums can sometimes prove too dry an experience to hold a teenager’s attention. The Exploratorium has solved that issue by being a completely interactive experience, so engaging that your teen won’t even notice they’re learning a bit about science along the way. 

**Contend with the Elements:** Traverse the eerie [Fog bridge](https://www.exploratorium.edu/exhibits/fog-bridge-72494). Then step into a [Tornado](https://www.exploratorium.edu/exhibits/tornado)

**Experience Mind-Boggling Optical Illusions** : with the ghostly [Bird in A Cage](https://www.exploratorium.edu/exhibits/bird-in-a-cage) exhibit. Or try to comprehend the [Cafe Wall Illusion](https://www.exploratorium.edu/exhibits/cafe-wall-illusion)

**Become a Part of the Art** : with interactive exhibits like [All Eyes on Me](https://www.exploratorium.edu/exhibits/all-eyes-on-me) or the [Shadow Box](https://www.exploratorium.edu/exhibits/shadow-box)

The Exploratorium is a museum that offers countless hours of entertainment. It is also home to a lovely restaurant called the [Seaglass Cafe](https://www.seaglassrestaurantsf.com), where you can eat after exploring the galleries.

## 3\. Tour Alcatraz and See the Bay

![boat touring alcatraz in san francisco](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20802'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![boat touring alcatraz in san francisco](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/3.-cityexperiences.com_-1024x802.png)Image Credit: cityexperiences.com

When thinking of engaging things to do in San Francisco with teenagers, visiting a historic site might not be your first thought, but a tour of Alcatraz infuses the sometimes dry subject of history with new life! 

Your teen will have heard of this storied prison in school, as well as many of its famous inmates (Al Capone! George “Machine Gun” Kelly!), and experiencing it in person will prove even more thrilling than they anticipate. And with the true crime boom at the forefront of social media right now, it’s sure to be a tour that entertains and shocks even the most jaded of teens. 

You can [cruise the bay](https://www.cityexperiences.com/san-francisco/city-cruises/alcatraz/) on your way over to the prison and enjoy beautiful views of the placid water, as well as some great photo ops, to make a whole day out of your visit.

## 4\. Feed Your Sweet Tooth in Ghirardelli Square

![ghiradelli square during sunset in san francisco](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20503'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![ghiradelli square during sunset in san francisco](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/4.-Ghiradellisq.com_-1024x503.png)Image Credit: ghiradellisq.com

This iconic square was once the birthplace of the Ghirardelli Chocolate Company. Now it has become a local hotspot with hotels, restaurants, and great shops to explore.

[**Ghirardelli Shop**](https://www.ghirardelli.com/stores/new-york?srsltid=AfmBOooW-hRB3JOrVR5g3bcFtJI1FjZuRZOYeWs7BtNpD4AkPzJb8o30): grab dessert at the Ghirardelli Ice Cream and Chocolate Shop. The line may look long, but it goes quickly. The menu features special themed treats like the “Gold Rush”, the “Golden Gate Bridge Banana Split”, and the “Land’s End”, which blend Ghirardelli’s rich chocolate with refreshing ice cream

[**Subpar Mini Golf**](https://www.subparminigolf.com/san-francisco): now that you and your teen have satiated your sweet tooth, the games can begin! Head over for 18 holes of mini golf at Subpar. Or if you’d prefer some less strenuous fun, they offer classic arcade games in the back

[**Cheese School of San Francisco**](https://thecheeseschool.com): for the lactose-tolerant, cheese class is in session! The Cheese School of San Francisco is devoted to the appreciation of cheese. You can learn how to arrange a killer charcuterie board in a [class](https://thecheeseschool.com/collections/public-classes), or just peruse the cheese selection and try some samples

Ghirardelli Square is full of life and activity 7 days a week! You and your teenager are sure to enjoy yourselves at this iconic spot.

## 5\. Cycle over the Golden Gate Bridge

![golden gate bridge in san francisco](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20512'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![golden gate bridge in san francisco](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/5.-parksconservancy.org_-1024x512.jpg)Image Credit: parksconservancy.org

The Golden Gate Bridge is one of the best feats of architecture and engineering in America. San Francisco can sometimes be stressful to traverse by car, so why not hop on a bike to enjoy the view with your teen? 

If you elect to bike it on the weekend or weekdays after 3:30, you can enjoy the entire west side of the bridge, which is closed off from all vehicles and reserved for bikers and pedestrians to enjoy. You can either[ book a guided tour](https://www.blazingsaddles.com/san-francisco/routes-and-tours/bike-the-bridge) of the bridge and surrounding parks or [rent a bike](https://sfbiketours.com/bike-rentals/) and do it yourself. 

While you’re at it, we recommend biking around the base of the bridge to take in the historic Fort Point on the south side, as well as taking a moment to give a high five to the [Hopper’s Hand sign](https://www.parksconservancy.org/gateways-article/what-is-story-behind-hoppers-hands-fort-point), a local tradition.

## 6\. Visit Pier 39

![pier 39 in san francisco, a great place to visit with teenagers](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20481'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![pier 39 in san francisco, a great place to visit with teenagers](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/6.-pier39.com_-1024x481.jpeg)Image Credit: pier39.com

If your teenager enjoys arcades, rides, and a classic boardwalk feel (and what teen doesn’t!) Pier 39 is the place to be. Endless entertainment and stimulation can be found throughout the Pier’s many exhibits and attractions. 

**Visit the adorable**[**Seals at the Pier**](https://pier39.com/sealions/): and if you enjoy sea creatures and want to see even more, you can get on a [whale tour](https://pier39.com/san-francisco-whale-tours/) right then and there

**Head over to the**[**Player’s Sports Bar & Arcade**](https://pier39.com/players-sports-grill-arcade/): to get yourself a drink, and your teen a few rounds of skee ball and whack-a-mole

**Touch the sky at**[**Frequent Fliers**](https://pier39.com/frequent-flyers/): if your teen likes amusement parks, they’re certain to enjoy the thrill of this bungee cord trampoline 

**Watch the**[**Street Performers**](https://pier39.com/street-performers-musicians/): free shows are happening all day on the Bay End Stage

By the end of the night, you’ll end up enjoying this spot as much as your teen does!

## 7\. Explore Art & Food with a Mission Walking Tour

![plate of tacos served during mission district food tour; eating tacos is one of the best things to do with a teenager in san francisco](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![plate of tacos served during mission district food tour; eating tacos is one of the best things to do with a teenager in san francisco](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/mission-district-tour-team-building-activities-in-the-bay-area.jpg)

You can’t leave San Francisco without enjoying the incredible Latin cuisine this city is known for. A visit to the Mission District engages all your senses, with mesmerizing murals, decadent dishes, and a deep connection to the thriving Latino population of SF.

Avital Food & Drink experiences offers a [mission district food tour](https://avitalexperiences.com/experiences/san-francisco-mission-district-food-tour/) that hits all the highlights of this district, while also giving you a taste of the area’s best restaurants. No need to wait in line to sample the Mission’s best dishes, your Avital tour guide will get you seated right away, and served steaming hot tamal, fresh seafood, or a sweet treat, stat!

This tour will keep your teen well-fed and captivated by the colorful street art and quirky stories the guide tells between each restaurant. The best way to experience this district is with an expert who can direct your eye and palette to the best of what it has to offer.

## 8\. Botanical Gardens After Dark

![group of people listening to piano at san francisco botanical garden](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20843'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![group of people listening to piano at san francisco botanical garden](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/8.-gggp.org_-1024x843.jpg)Image Credit: gggp.org

There is plenty to see in the Botanical Gardens of San Francisco during the day, but have you ever hung around after dark? [Flower Piano](https://gggp.org/flowerpiano/) is an event that occurs in the garden multiple times a year, and if it’s on when you’re in town, you won’t want to miss it.

A dozen pianos are scattered around the San Francisco Botanical Gardens, and on Flower Piano nights, pianists of all different genres and styles take up residence at the pianos. String lights and candles light the park, and there are food trucks and drinks for purchase.

Your teen will feel like a VIP at this cultivated, after-hours event, in the dark.

## 9\. Spend a Day at the Beach

![rock on beach in san franicisco](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![rock on beach in san franicisco](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/beach-birthday-party-point-dume.jpg)

When on the West Coast, you must take advantage of the beaches! San Francisco has charming sandy beaches, with great views, and deep blue water. Here are some of our favorites:

**Baker Beach** : offers large waves and dramatic views–sitting at the base of the cliffs on which the Golden Gate Bridge is erected. You can observe sea life near the shoreline and fish at this beach

**Mile Rock Beach** : if you’re looking for a beach that offers a bit of terrain, climbing down the makeshift stairs to Mile Rock Beach is an exciting experience. The beach is covered in beautiful rocks and also has sandy stretches, where you can sit and relax

**Crissy Field Beach** : provides beautiful views of the Golden Gate Bridge and Alacatraz. There are picnic tables where you and your teen can sit and share a meal, and hiking trails if you get your fill of lazing around in the sun 

You and your teen should make sure to spend an afternoon basking in the glorious sun and breathing in the ocean air.

## 10\. Catch a Game at Oracle Park

![exterior shot of oracle park in san francisco](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20576'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![exterior shot of oracle park in san francisco](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/10.-mlb.com_.jpg)Image Credit: mlb.com

If your teenager is a sports fanatic, you’ll want to go to San Francisco’s eminent baseball stadium, [Oracle Park](https://www.mlb.com/giants/ballpark). It is home to the San Francisco Giants, and if you time your trip right, you can catch your teen’s favorite team there as well.

Oracle Park is located on the waterfront, offering stunning views of the bay that you can enjoy during the game. It is also home to McCovey Cove, where kayakers gather during games to try and catch home run balls that pop over the stadium walls. 

If you’re hungry, you can enjoy classic baseball stadium concessions, but since you’re right in the heart of downtown San Francisco, you can also enjoy the culinary scene there before or after the game. We recommend trying [Merkado](https://www.merkadosf.com/about/), an outstanding Mexican restaurant just a few blocks away from the ballpark!

## 11\. Relax at the Japanese Tea Garden

![exterior of Japanese tea garden in san francisco](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20840%20550'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![exterior of Japanese tea garden in san francisco](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/11.-japaneseteagardensf.com_.jpeg)Image Credit: japaneseteagardensf.com

After the hustle and bustle of some of the bigger tourist attractions you visit on your trip, a moment of tranquility might be just what you need. The [Japanese tea garden](https://www.japaneseteagardensf.com) in the San Francisco Botanical Gardens is the perfect respite to take a beat and reflect, surrounded by beauty and verdant foliage. 

Not to mention, it has some of the most incredible photo ops San Fran has to offer. You can pose by towering pagodas, lyrical bridges, or surrounded by shimmering Koi.

After taking in the sights, you and your teen can grab a Japanese treat and a cup of tea, sit, and reflect on all the fun you’ve had thus far on your trip!

## 12\. Tour Famous Movie Locations 

![family with teenager posing for picture during san francisco movie tour](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20720%20480'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![family with teenager posing for picture during san francisco movie tour](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/12.-sanfranciscomovietours.com_.jpeg)Image Credit: sanfranciscomovietours.com

If your teen is a film buff, you’ll want to [book a tour ](https://sanfranciscomovietours.com/activities/san-francisco-movie-sights-tour/)that takes them to all the famous locations in San Francisco where iconic movies have been shot. San Francisco is a prime shooting location for many films because of its proximity to L.A. as well as its diversity in architecture, culture, and landscapes.

To name just a few, _Dirty Harry, Bullit, Mrs. Doubtfire_ , and _Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home_ all have prominent scenes in San Fran. An experienced guide will lead you to those locations and give you insider access to tour them and take photographs, all the while giving you the behind-the-scenes scoop on the making of these films.

## 13\. Plan a Day Trip to a National Park

![tall trees and plants with light and mist in san francisco national park](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20768'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![tall trees and plants with light and mist in san francisco national park](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/13.-nps.gov_-1024x768.jpeg)Image Credit: nps.gov

San Francisco is in close proximity to many beautiful national parks. If your teen loves being in nature, or even if they prefer the indoors, and you’re looking for an outdoor activity impressive enough to persuade them to get some sun, these parks are so breathtaking that it will inspire gratitude and awe no matter their attitude.

**Muir Woods** : he ancient Coast Redwood Trees in Muir Woods have to be seen to be believed. They tower over you at heights up to 250 feet, and some have been around for over 1,200 years. You can combine sending the park with a trip to Sausalito with tours like [this one by Gray Line](https://graylineofsanfrancisco.com/tours/muir-woods-sausalito-tour/)

**Yosemite** : if you and your teen enjoy a rigorous hike, Yosemite is the park for you. It is home to iconic cliffs like El Capitan and the Half Dome, beautiful waterfalls, and thriving wildlife. [Extranomical](https://www.extranomical.com/tour/yosemite-one-day-tour-from-san-francisco/) offers an accessible one-day tour that shows you all the best sights in the park

**Pinnacles** : although the lesser-known of these three parks, Pinnacles has something entirely original to offer tourists. The park is composed of steep walls and caverns created by volcanic eruptions. It’s about a 2-hour drive from the city, so if you have a car with you, this could be the perfect day trip

If you are in San Francisco for multiple days, you should definitely reserve one to see these grandiose national monuments. It will be an unforgettable experience for you and your teen, rife with unbeatable photo opportunities and the joy of experiencing the awe-inspiring natural world.

## 14\. Experience the Cirque at Club Fugazi 

Club Fugazi is consistently rated as “best in the bay” by locals and tourists alike. The venue is home to world-class acrobats performing a rotating menu of shows for your entertainment. The current resident show, “[Dear San Francisco](https://tickets.clubfugazisf.com/tickets/series/DearSanFrancisco?_gl=1*1yiwp0r*_gcl_au*MTgxMzI2Mjg4OS4xNzQ2MDMzNjQy),” is in such high demand it’s back for the third year in a row! It is a true love letter to the city.

The club also has a curated menu of food and drinks for purchase. The space is an intimate, 300-seat venue, and there isn’t a bad seat in the house!

If you’re looking for an extra special place to celebrate your time in San Francisco, you can book the [Tiara Suite and Lounge](https://www.clubfugazisf.com/group-sales). It is a private skybox where you can view the performance, and it has space for up to 25 people. It would be the perfect place to celebrate your teen‘s birthday in style, or simply to commemorate your special visit with pizzazz!

## 15\. Visit an Art Museum

![mom and tween looking at art while visiting an art museum in san francisco](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20587'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![mom and tween looking at art while visiting an art museum in san francisco](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/15.-sfmoma.com_-1024x587.png)Image Credit: sfmoma.com

If your teen is an aspiring artist, they are certain to enjoy a visit to one of the city’s art museums. Some of our recommendations are:

[**The** **San Francisco Museum of Modern Art**](https://www.sfmoma.org): Experience exhibits like the “Living Wall”, take in the exquisite architecture of the building, and admire famous Modern artists like Rothko and Matisse

## Final Thoughts

New flash! Teens are picky. But planning a fun day with them is priceless. The most important questions to ask yourself when crafting an itinerary for your San Francisco trip with a teenager are: 

  * What attractions will hold their attention? 
  * Do our plans include sensory experiences, like tasting good food, or interacting with games and activities? 
  * Can we make seeing the sights more active, by biking or walking around them? 



Your teen is sure to be dazzled by their time in San Francisco if you can check off these questions when planning your vacation or special outing. Cheers to creating life-long memories with your teen during your visit to “The Golden City!”
