#  The Ultimate Guide to Charcuterie Chalets in 2023 

December 5, 2022 

You’re gathered about the dining room table, surrounded by family and friends. There’s music, lights, drinks, and laughter, all surrounding a little house made of meat and cheese. Ok, maybe it’s not the Hallmark Classic you remember, but in addition to being fun, quirky, and delicious, Charcuterie Chalets have an incredible way of bringing people together, especially around the holidays! 

We’ve been designing award-winning culinary experiences for the last 11 years. And since March 2020, we’ve shipped over 50,000 experience kits, including our newest Charcuterie Chalet Kit. Our mission is to deepen human connection through interactive food + drink experiences. And we believe our charcuterie chalet kits do just that! 

**Ready to bite into this world of edible architecture? In this guide we’ll cover:**

  2. **Why Build a Charcuterie Chalet?**
  3. **12 Awesome Charcuterie Chalets to Inspire Your Build**

## What Is A Charcuterie Chalet?

&lt;span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;

Charcuterie chalets, also known as charcuterie houses or charcuterie gingerbread houses, are savory gingerbread houses made from ingredients typically found on a charcuterie and cheese board. The structure is made of crackers or flatbreads, held together with spreadable cheese. Then it’s decorated using finocchiona salami for scrumptious shingles, fresh rosemary as festive wreaths, and grated parmesan as savory snow. 

The origin of the concept is unknown, but search traffic peaked in December 2020. Since then, the charcuterie chalet has remained a unique remix on the classic holiday gingerbread tradition.  
  


## Why Build A Charcuterie Chalet?

Nothing brings people together like food. Combine that with creative construction and you have the recipe for an incredible afternoon or evening of fun. Great for teams, families, couples, and friends, the Charcuterie Chalet Kit is the ultimate way to connect this holiday season and beyond. 

Brings People Together: Collaborate (or compete) with friends, family, or colleagues as you build your creations together. Doing something new and different together will allow you to learn more about one another. 

Delicious Lasting Memories: Enjoy the rich meats and cheeses, then cherish the memories forever. A more thoughtful and sustainable gift than cheap trinkets, scratchy socks, or boring gift baskets.

Unique Crowd Pleaser: Even for the tough “those who have everything” recipients on your list. Chalets can be made vegetarian to accommodate dietary restrictions too!

## How to Build a Charcuterie Chalet

The best part about building charcuterie chalets is that you can bring your own creativity to the table! It can also be customized to your liking. For example, if you don’t eat meat, you can make a veggie villa or fromage cottage! You can also make it as simple or complex as you’d like.

Option 1: Buy a Charcuterie Chalet Kit 

If you want to build something beautiful and delicious, but also easy, get a [charcuterie chalet kit](https://ediblearchitecture.com/products/edible-architecture-kit-charcuterie-chalet). The kit includes everything you need to build your own savor gingerbread house, including a step-by-step building guide, all tools, and high-quality, delicious ingredients.

Option 2: Follow a Charcuterie Chalet Recipe 

If you’re up for a challenge you can skip the kit and create your own design! It’s great to take inspiration from other creators, but it’s also fun to think outside the box and come up with new styles and decor ideas.

Once you’ve decided on the direction you’d like to go, the basic steps are the same.

## Step 1. Gather your Materials

Here’s the items that you’ll need in each category to make your Charcuterie Chalet:

STRUCTURAL SUPPORT & WALLS (Pick 2-3): Choose ingredients like crackers, pretzel rods, breadsticks, or flatbreads.

BINDING GLUE (Pick 1): Choose sticky, spreadable ingredients, like spreadable cheese, cream cheese, or even Cheez Whiz.

DECOR (Pick 3-5): Choose ingredients with a variety of flavors and textures, like different cheeses, deli meats, fresh herbs, fresh vegetables and fruits, pickled things, nuts, and other snacks.

TOOLS:

  * Surface to Build Chalet: Baking Sheet, Plate, Cutting Board, etc
  * Cutting Board
  * Sharp Knife
  * Butter Knife or Spoon
  * Ziplock Bag + Scissors for Piping



## Step 2. Make Structure of Charcuterie Chalet

You can choose from a variety of different materials to build you structure with.

**Breadsticks or Pretzel Rods:** Create your chalet using a log cabin style build. Think Lincoln Logs!

**Flatbreads:** It is recommended to build the walls first and then bind them together with Binding Glue to make a cube-like structure. Of course, you can get creative here.

You’ll need structural supports to make your charcuterie chalet structurally sound and to hold the roof up. Ways to make it supported are to use breadsticks on joints where walls come together, use flatbreads overlapping seams perpendicularly to strengthen them, create internal support beams to rest the roof structure on, and/or build up posts in the middle of the structure.

## Step 3. Decorate Your Charcuterie Chalet

This is where your imagination can run wild. Use salami shingles, parmesan as snow, pickles for trees, and more!

## Free Charcuterie Chalet Shopping List

Whether you [buy a kit](https://ediblearchitecture.com/products/edible-architecture-kit-charcuterie-chalet) or do it all yourself, charcuterie chalets are one of the best ways to connect with family and friends. Give as a gift, do it it together before a holiday meal, or compete with colleagues in a festive team building challenge. Flex your creative muscles this holiday season!
