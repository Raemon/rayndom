#  Self-Guided San Francisco Easter Egg Hunt 

March 26, 2016 

**_Your Self Guided San Francisco Easter Egg Hunt written by Culinary Guide, Hana Nobel_ **

We love a Cadbury Crème Egg as much as the next person, but being people who love food, Avital Culinary Guides are focused on meals this Easter. We’re throwing our own San Francisco Easter egg hunt, but instead of candy eggs, we’re eating the best egg dishes the city has to offer. We wouldn’t recommend eating all seven of these in one day (but more power to you if you can), and luckily these dishes are available year round. From breakfast tacos to deviled eggs to a secret savory breakfast pastry, these eggs are worth the hunt…and luckily we’ve done all of the work (except the eating) for you.

![Deveil's Teeth Baking Company in San Francisco ](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Deveil's Teeth Baking Company in San Francisco ](http://avitaltours.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Devils-Teeth-Baking-Company.jpg)

**1.[Devils Teeth Baking Company](http://devilsteethbakingcompany.com)**

Special Breakfast Sandwich: Two eggs scrambled, with pepper jack cheese, applewood smoked bacon, avocado, and their famous lemon-garlic aioli on homemade buttermilk biscuit. Devil’s Teeth Baking Company is a beachy local favorite for residents of the Outer Sunset. There’s limited seating on the outdoor benches, but your sandwich might taste even better while sitting on the sand. Address: _3876 Noriega St, San Francisco, CA 94122; Phone: (415) 683-5533_

![Eggs benedict at Zazie in San Francisco](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Eggs benedict at Zazie in San Francisco](http://avitaltours.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/zazie.jpg)

**2.[Zazie](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=Zazie+sf&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)**

Eggs Benedict. Zazie has six kinds of eggs Benedict on the menu, from the simpler Florentine topped with spinach and Portobello mushrooms to the La Mer with dungeness crab, avocados, and green onions. All six are served on an English muffin with housemaid lemon hollandaise sauce you can choose 1,2, or 3 eggs depending on how hungry you are. Zazie has a back porch that’s pet friendly, so bring your dog along, but keep the Benedict for yourself. Address: 941 Cole St, San Francisco, CA 94117; Phone: (415) 564-5332

![Breakfast tacos at West of Pecos](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Breakfast tacos at West of Pecos](http://avitaltours.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/pork-belly.jpg)

**3.[West of Pecos](http://westofpecos.com)**

Pork Belly Austin Breakfast Tacos: Scrambled eggs, maple-glazed pork belly, shredded cheese, flour tortillas, avocado, and chipotle aioli. West of Pecos is a great brunch spot in the Mission complete with spicy cocktails that will really wake you up. It’s never too early for pork belly (especially maple glazed pork belly) so grab these southwestern tacos for breakfast and get your morning eggs in a fun (and pretty messy) way. Address: 550 Valencia Street, San Francisco, CA 94110; Phone: (415) 252-7000

![Hog & Rocks Restaurant in San Francisco](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Hog & Rocks Restaurant in San Francisco](http://avitaltours.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/screen_shot_2015-08-20_at_12.13.30_pm.png)

**4.[Hog & Rocks](http://www.hogandrocks.com)**

Deviled Eggs topped with country ham and a fried oyster. Known for their ham (hog) and oysters (rocks), Hog & Rocks is a popular spot for both in the Mission. These deviled eggs topped with both are listed on their “snacks” menu and are more sophisticated than the deviled eggs served at most childhood picnics. Address: 3431 19th Street, San Francisco, CA 94110; Phone: (415) 550-8627

![kitchen in Park Tavern restaurant](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![kitchen in Park Tavern restaurant](http://avitaltours.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/pt.jpg)

**5.[Park Tavern](http://parktavernsf.com)**

Smoked Deviled Eggs with with bacon, pickled jalapeño and chive. One of our North Beach favorites serves their own sophisticated version of deviled eggs. Bacon makes everything taste a little better and the saltiness of the bacon is complimented with the spicy jalapeño on top. You can them individually under “Jenn’s Classics” on the menu, but we think you’ll probably want more than one. Address: 1652 Stockton Street, San Francisco, CA 94133; Phone: (415) 989-7300

![muffin with an egg inside at Craftsman and Wolves restaurant](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![muffin with an egg inside at Craftsman and Wolves restaurant](http://avitaltours.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rebel.jpg)

**6.[Craftsman and Wolves](http://www.craftsman-wolves.com)**

The Rebel Within: an innocent looking muffin with a secret. Cut open the muffin (which contains sausage, green onions, Parmesan, and Asiago cheese, and find an egg inside. The egg is soft cooked so the yolk oozes out. In this case, you really are on a hunt to find the egg. Address: 746 Valencia Street, San Francisco CA 94110; Phone: (415) 913-7713

![Egg Custard Tarts at Golden Gate Bakery](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Egg Custard Tarts at Golden Gate Bakery](http://avitaltours.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ggb.jpg)

**7.[Golden Gate Bakery](https://www.yelp.com/biz/golden-gate-bakery-san-francisco)**

Egg Custard Tarts-a Chinese egg pastry. You can’t forget dessert on your egg hunt. Our favorite egg tarts in the city come from Golden Gate Bakery, which serves them fresh out of the oven. They are flaky, sweet, and creamy all at the same time. Expect a line, but it moves pretty quickly and the tarts are worth the wait. You can snag one, but you’ll probably want to pick up a few for later and have them boxed up. Address: 1029 Grant Ave, San Francisco, CA 94133; Phone: (415) 781-2627
