## Best Restaurants for Groups SF 

Your initial instinct when planning a group dining event is likely to reach out to a restaurant, and for many people, that is the proper venue for their event. There are so many excellent [restaurants for large groups in SF](https://avitalexperiences.com/resources/best-restaurants-for-large-groups-sf/) that the small things will be the deciding factor in which you choose. We encourage our clients to pay special attention to location, cuisine, group size, and privacy when vetting their options.

San Francisco offers a diversity of cuisine and atmosphere in its restaurant scene. We have broken down our favorite restaurants for [private dining in San Francisco](https://avitalexperiences.com/san-francisco/private-dining/) below, by location, cuisine, and the size of group it is able to accommodate.  


### SF Restaurant Group Dining Options 

When considering the best restaurants for groups in SF, a deciding factor may be the amount of privacy your group requires. You can choose to make a reservation online, but private dining options might be better for certain events. We’ll do a brief breakdown of your options below, but for a more detailed explanation, you can check out our [Expert Guide to San Francisco Private Dining](https://avitalexperiences.com/san-francisco/private-dining/).

**Private Dining Rooms** : Certain events are not conducive to a loud atmosphere. When vying to impress new clients or having a formal gathering like a baby shower or reception, private dining provides much-needed peace and focus.

**Semi-Private Spaces** : Usually, this scenario includes a partition between your event and the rest of the restaurant. This is enough privacy for casual events like birthday parties, big family gatherings, or team-building events.

**Group Reservations** : This is when you simply book through a restaurant’s online reservation service or by calling ahead. Group reservations are perfectly adequate for meeting up with friends, parents, or lovers.

The [Ohana Table](https://lycsf.com/pages/liholihos-ohana-table) is an incredible deal, at $75 per guest, you get a family-style feast! This table can accommodate between 8 and 14 guests. They set you up at a high top at the front of the restaurant and bring out plates of tuna poke, duck liver mousse, and taro puff to start. You get three decadent courses and a delicious dessert to end the night.

The [Gen Gen Room](https://lycsf.com/pages/gen-gen-room) is a private dining room within the Yacht Club that can accommodate 10-20 people. It is a more robust menu at $150 per guest, and it really feels like a VIP experience!

### Merkado

[Website](https://www.merkadosf.com)

[Open in Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ijHphGQgTusRShP89)

Merkado is known for its tacos, tequila, and mezcal. This restaurant is perfect for groups because you can order en masse off their bites menu and share delicious appetizers like their “Tariff-ic Guacamole”, or crispy fish tostadas with all the fixings. Or you can opt to order a ton of tacos so everyone can pile their plates with their favorites. We highly recommend their succulent barbacoa taco (braised goat) and their Jardín taco (with chayote, a vegetable pear), a vegetarian option even meat lovers will be impressed by! This space works great for big groups who want to have a good time and enjoy strong drinks.

If you want to impress clients or friends with a perfectly cooked steak and a beautiful atmosphere, the Vault is the place to be. The indoor part of the restaurant is built in a former Bank of America vault. They offer a creative menu for group dining experiences. You can order beautifully crafted boards—charcuterie, cheese, crudité, bread, or dips—at a reasonable price. These boards range from $30 to $125 and serve 25 guests. Or you can order plates from the raw bar, plates of assorted sliders, or skewers of tender meats and vegetables. The Vault is one of the best restaurants for groups in SF because you can mix and match to get your perfect menu.

## Best SF Food Halls and Food Trucks for Groups

Food halls and trucks can be a great alternative to sit-down restaurants or event spaces. They have the added bonus of allowing guests to choose their meal, so everyone is always happy with the food. Food halls are a great place to take friends for a quick catch-up or co-workers for a casual team building lunch.

![medium_large](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20768%20512'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![medium_large](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/12.-lacochinasf.com_-768x512.jpg)

La Cocina serves delicious food you can feel great about eating! This food hall was created to give women, immigrants, and people of color with culinary talent who lacked the resources to open their own restaurants, a place to cook and work towards their financial goals. The menus constantly rotate as vendors come in and out, and there are long communal tables where you can sit and enjoy your meal.

[Open in Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8VL2fAZddNnpYtHG9)

Food trucks are more popular than food halls in SF. They take advantage of San Francisco’s lovely weather and let many vendors work in the same location. Spark Social is a permanent food truck park, and they update their vendors every day on their website. They are also selling beer and sangria all day if you’re looking to celebrate! There are some tables to eat at, but you can also bring a picnic blanket and spread out on the grass.

### San Francisco Food Tour

[Website](https://avitalexperiences.com/san-francisco/)

[Open in Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hoxDAoWtycGga2RX7)

A food tour is a great way to take group dining to the next level. We offer a [North Beach Food Tour](https://avitalexperiences.com/experiences/san-francisco-north-beach-food-tour/), a [Mission District Food Tour](https://avitalexperiences.com/experiences/san-francisco-mission-district-food-tour/), and a [Chinatown Food Tour](https://avitalexperiences.com/experiences/san-francisco-chinatown-food-tour/) here in SF. An engaging Avital guide will take you to four of the best restaurants in your desired area, all the while relaying quirky and interesting stories about the neighborhood to your group. Then you will skip the line and be seated, and mouth-watering food will be immediately served at each location. 

These tours are great for team-building events because people will naturally sit in different configurations at every stop and have time to get to know one another more and truly bond. This is also an excellent option for bringing clients from out of town because they can learn a little about the city and take in the sights, all while enjoying good food. Birthday parties, anniversary celebrations, and family reunions are also a great fit for a food tour!

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2040%2040'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/location-icon.svg)

### Dinner on a Boat

When in the Bay Area, one must take advantage of the Bay! Many boats and cruise ships offer scenic dinner experiences for groups where you can dine in style on the Bay. Whether you are sailing by the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, or the Ferry Building, it is sure to be a night full of photo ops, good food, and conversation. This is a great choice for entertaining VIP clients or celebrating an important anniversary with friends and family. 

![medium_large](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![medium_large](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/parkside-picnic-30th-birthday-idea.jpg)

### Picnic by the Water

San Francisco has many beautiful beaches and parks near the water where you can set up a picnic. The West Bluff Picnic Area is a very popular spot due to its proximity to the Golden Gate Bridge and views of the water. Little Marina also has a quaint picnic area if you’d prefer views of the Palace of Fine Arts. Picnicking is a great way to celebrate the end of a successful quarter with your coworkers or to take a big group of friends out to enjoy beautiful weather and conversation.

![medium_large](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20768%20597'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![medium_large](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/woman-making-bruschetta-during-cooking-class-1-768x597.jpg)

### DIY Dinner

Sometimes the most rewarding dinner is one you cooked yourself, but if you’re tired of the same 5 recipes you’ve had on repeat for the last four months, a cooking class that culminates in a dining experience might be just what you need! Instead of inviting friends or family over for a classic dinner party, classes where instructors teach you to cook exciting new dishes together can be a fun alternative. This is the perfect experience for groups of friends, to celebrate your birthday if you’re a foodie who enjoys cooking, or even for groups of coworkers looking for an alternative to formal group dinners.

![medium_large](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20768%20512'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![medium_large](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/18.-Thedinnerdetective.com_-768x512.jpg)

### ****Dinner Theater****

Dinner theater has come a long way in recent years. Many places are now introducing interactive events, like [The Dinner Detective Show](https://www.thedinnerdetective.com/san-francisco/#more-info) in the Financial District. As dinner is served, you watch a murder mystery unfold in front of you, and you might even get roped into the case, or accused of being an accomplice! If your group is full of theater-lovers or enjoys a little drama, consider taking them to a dinner theater experience.
