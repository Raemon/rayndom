If your team works remotely, you may not be able to volunteer traditionally for the holidays. So we think a virtual auction is an excellent way to give back and make a contribution as a team! Find local shops in your city or town and have them each donate one item. The team can then auction to buy the item, while the company donates the proceeds to a charity of your choosing.

### 4\. Hire Carolers

Christmas is a time for carols and cheer, and since you can’t bring carolers into the office, bring them into your home…virtually! Check out [The Yuletide Carolers](https://www.theyuletidecarolers.com/about-3), who sing every Christmas song you can imagine!

### 5\. Christmas Tree Decorating

Sync up to decorate the tree together! Hop on Zoom while you deck the halls and accessorize the Christmas tree. You’re sure to learn something new about each other when you start asking questions about where your coworker got that [poodoph the toilet reindeer ornament.](https://www.etsy.com/listing/257336696/poodolph-toilet-reindeer-ornament-gag?ls=r&external=1&rec_type=cs&ref=pla_similar_listing_top-5&content_source=c7f32b0a8431444c390ecead135897d1%253ALT1061e4bc4b9fc7d40fb7953858c1027aa61c6f7b&logging_key=c7f32b0a8431444c390ecead135897d1%3ALT1061e4bc4b9fc7d40fb7953858c1027aa61c6f7b)

### 19\. Naughty List Game

If they have done whatever the statement says, they put a finger down. [Here are some Naughty List questions](https://wagner.edu/alumni-friends/files/2020/11/The-Naughty-List-Game-1.pdf) to get you started.

### 23\. Christmas Movie Dubbing

Host a Christmas Movie dubbing party and get everyone laughing! It’s a fun twist on a classic improv game. I mean, we’ve all seen _Who’s Line Is It Anyway?_ Right?

### 29\. Winter Wonderland

A Winter Wonderland theme transforms any venue into a magical holiday escape with white decorations, snowflakes, and silver accents. You can create a virtual background with these elements and send it out to your employees. Encourage your employees to dress in the color palette of whites, silvers, and light blues to create an elegant atmosphere.  


### 30\. Christmas Movie Costumes

We all have that one movie we MUST watch during the holidays. So why not have a little costume fun and come dressed up as your favourite character? If you’re looking for a little help coming up with a character, here’s a [list of holiday movies](https://www.listchallenges.com/75-holiday-movies) you can check out. 

## Virtual Work Christmas Party Tips

**Keep Opening Comments Short:** This is a party after all, not a presentation!

**Come in with a Plan:** A little bit of structure goes a long way! Map out the order of events and activities with time estimates beforehand.

**Keep it Inclusive:** Try and focus on activities and traditions that unite all holiday celebrations!

**Get Dressed for the Occasion:** Combining any of the activities and games we’ve listed with instructions to dress in ugly holiday sweaters is an easy way to get people in the spirit.

**Surprise Everyone with a Gift:** Activities involving sending kits to people’s doors are an awesome way to make everyone feel like they’re receiving a thoughtful present.

**Don’t Forget the Group Photo:** Screenshotting capabilities exist for a reason!
