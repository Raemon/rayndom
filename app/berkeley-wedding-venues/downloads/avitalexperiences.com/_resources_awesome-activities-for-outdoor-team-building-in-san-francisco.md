#  20 Awesome Activities for Outdoor Team Building in San Francisco 

December 20, 2021 

Being stuck in the office day in and day out could get boring. Your team needs a little Vitamin C every now and again and it’s time to bring them outdoors. The best way to do that, you ask? Well, try one of the many activities for outdoor team building in San Francisco.

## **What are activities for outdoor team building in San Francisco?**

You might be wondering, what are activities for outdoor team building? In San Francisco you have such a wide variety of options. But let’s give you a straightforward definition then get into what San Francisco especially has to offer. 

Outdoor team building activities are any team building activities that happen outside, and we would say especially outside of your office at another location. Bringing your team outside for their team building activity really gives them a clear physical and mental break from the office environment. This allows them to let go of the work day and focus on getting to know their colleagues, and most importantly, have a fun time. The more engaged your employees are, the more beneficial your team building event will be. 

In San Francisco the weather is usually fantastic and there are so many outdoor activities already. SF has almost twenty percent of its land dedicated to outdoor spaces. So, it’s a real gold mine for finding different outdoor team building activities. 

## **What are the benefits of outdoor team building in San Francisco?**

Doing activities outdoors is a great way to get your team out of the office, into a different environment and liven things up. Not to mention, the many great benefits that come with taking your team building activities outdoors.

Yes, heading outside for team building activities may seem like an excuse to use the sunny, warm weather but there are actually so many benefits. For one, leaving the comfort zone of your office bubble will help foster a more honest and vulnerable environment. Team members will have the opportunity to share their concerns and fears more openly; this will, in turn, give you the chance to create that safe space for them.

Second, it helps your team members bridge the gap between a professional and personal relationship. We often only see our co-workers in a workplace setting and rarely have the chance to get to know them on a more personal level. And we want that! It helps create trust and confidence in the other person. And finally, when doing activities outdoors, you’re more likely to be a bit more active which is always great for your team’s health and wellness. So overall, a total win I’d say!

With that said, we’ve got you covered with our our list of 7 awesome activities for outdoor team building in San Francisco

You can even set up a giant picnic in one of the park’s many open spaces with tables and benches as a base camp for everyone.

**_For what type of team?_** For independent and adventurous teams

## **BIKE THROUGH THE BAY ON EBIKES**

[![biking-through-marin--is-a-good-outdoor-team-building-experience-in-sf](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![biking-through-marin--is-a-good-outdoor-team-building-experience-in-sf](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/outdoor-team-building-san-francisco-biking.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/outdoor-team-building-san-francisco-biking.jpg)

[EcoBike Adventures ](https://ecobikeadv.com/)offers team building events where you and your team of 8-16 people can ride ebikes through the gorgeous nature of the Bay. You can choose your general biking location (we’re thinking redwoods but that’s just us!), but they’ll take care of the rest. One of their expert guides will lead the way and at the end of your journey, they can have entertainment, food, and music waiting for you. 

**_For what type of team?_** For smaller and athletic teams

## **GET CLOSE TO THE FOOD YOU EAT WITH A U-PICK DAY**

[![picking-fruit-at-a-farm-is-a-good-outdoor-team-building-experience-in-sf](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![picking-fruit-at-a-farm-is-a-good-outdoor-team-building-experience-in-sf](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/outdoor-team-building-san-francisco-u-pick.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/outdoor-team-building-san-francisco-u-pick.jpg)

U-picks are all over the country, but here in the bay we are lucky to have access to some amazing farms (and amazing weather that makes these farms so great). While this experience does usually require transportation, we feel it’s one of our best choices. Depending on the farm you choose (you can go north, south, and east of San Francisco for this event), you will have different options of what you can pick and what else you might be able to do on that farm. 

**For what type of team?** For foodies and down to earth teams

## **HIKE WITH YOUR TEAM IN ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PLACES IN THE WORLD**

[![going-to-point-reyes--is-a-good-outdoor-team-building-experience-in-sf](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![going-to-point-reyes--is-a-good-outdoor-team-building-experience-in-sf](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/outdoor-team-building-san-francisco-hiking.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/outdoor-team-building-san-francisco-hiking.jpg)

San Francisco’s Bay Area has some of the most beautiful hiking and walking trails in the world. For a low maintenance trip have your team meet at a location – we love the Marin Headlands, Lands End, and if you want to go further north, Point Reyes and go for a beautiful walk or hike. You can either have people plan to pack their own lunches and go rustic, or you can have reservations at a nearby restaurant to dine afterwards. 

**_For what type of team?_** For athletic and nature loving teams

I hope this list encouraged you to try an outdoor team building activity in San Francisco for your next event! So, which activity will your team be trying? We can’t wait to see you on our Food Tour!
