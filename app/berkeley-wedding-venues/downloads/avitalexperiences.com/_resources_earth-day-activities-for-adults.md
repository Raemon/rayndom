## 7\. Become De-Influencers

Our social media channels are flooded with influencers linking their Amazon storefronts and over consumption. Flip the script by becoming “[de-influencers](https://www.vogue.com/article/what-is-deinfluencing)” for the day. Have everyone on your team share when they’ve reduced, reused, or recycled, instead of buy new. For example, instead of buying plastic silverware for lunches, I buy second hand silverware at the thrift store and pack them with my lunch — I can reuse them many times, but won’t be too bummed out if I lose or forget a set.
