The Michelin guide says that the home-made seafood ravioli and crispy focaccia calda recco are not to be missed, and we have to agree. This is the highest quality Italian food you can get in the area without breaking the bank or having to wear a sports jacket! It’s a great birthday restaurant because it’s large and spacious, so you can bring a ton of friends in for a phenomenal meal.

You can order snacks for the table like sweet chili chicken wings, lemon butter snow crab legs, and warm soft pretzels with homemade honey butter. And of course, they have a great cocktail menu and draft beer selection to go with the beachy party vibes! Signature cocktails like the Lemon Drop-in, which is elevated with yuzu, Thai basil, and pink peppercorn, and the refreshing Blood Orange Mojito are great ways to start what is sure to be an all-day party!

The outdoor area is charming and beachy, and making a big group reservation to sit out there and enjoy the good food and weather is easy through the website. This cute eatery has caught the eye of the Michelin guide, who says that “the menu is refreshingly uncomplicated yet inventive” and highly recommends trying the crisp and lush tostada terraza and the “perfectly roasted and dressed” pollo a las brasa with achiote piquin sauce. They also praise the dessert menu, which certainly needs some attention, given it’s a birthday celebration!

The menu celebrates the dishes and cuisine of Michoacan, a culinary Mecca in central-west Mexico. You may want to consider booking out the private plancha room for up to ten guests. This experience starts with small bites and craft cocktails being served, then a big salad comes out, and then your main course of choice is cooked on the plancha grill at your table. Choose from dishes like melt-in-your-mouth wagyu carne asada, pepita-crusted sea bass, and perfectly spiced duck pibil.

[Bavel](https://baveldtla.com) is a perfect birthday restaurant because it specializes in big shareable dishes and takes reservations for groups up to 26 people. The incredible dishes range from house-made flatbreads and spreads, to a tantalizing platter of Middle Eastern cooked meats, to meat and fish dishes that come out steaming hot, perfectly spiced, and piled high on the plate. The wagyu beef cheek tagine will make your taste buds tingle and feed the whole table. The hardest thing about eating here is picking which dishes you can live without trying!

The patio is the highlight–reserve a table there, and you will be surrounded by fire pits, curvy arches, and real fig trees! Order up the massive skewers of meat and pass them around as you sip on incredible cocktails like the refreshing Laya Mist with Italicus Rosalio, Prosecco, and olives, or the complex Ambrosia with gin, honeydew, elderflower, and pistachio.

  * Cuisine: German
  * Price: $$



[Bia Ôm](https://www.instagram.com/sunsetbeergarden.la/) is a charming beer garden open weekends only that serves up German dishes and great beers that are brewed in-house. You can enjoy giant steins of their beers on tap or opt for slushy spritzes while you hang out in their big, shady courtyard. Start with the “Preiim Weggla” meaning “three in a bun”, and sink your teeth into snappy homemade pork sausages on soft bread. Then order up a huge Schnitzel, or the grilled mackerel with a refreshing gremolata sauce on top, and do some serious eating. And since it’s your birthday, we have to insist you end the night with dessert—so order the perennial tiramisu with espresso dipped cookies and mascarpone cream with cocoa.

  * Cuisine: Italian
  * Price: $$$



This is one of our favorite [LA private dining](https://avitalexperiences.com/los-angeles/private-dining/) restaurants because they have some of the most beautiful and flexible private event spaces we’ve encountered, perfect for big birthday parties. They have four different spaces that can accommodate 10-78 guests and are committed to “tailored hospitality.” Whether you’re dining privately or not, [Drago Centro](https://dragocentro.com) is a must-visit for fans of homemade pasta and delicious seafood. A perfect dish that combines these two strong points is the Il Risotto Alla Pescatora Al Nero, which is a delectable squid ink pasta with fresh seasonal seafood.

The menu is asian-inspired and features dishes from all over the continent of Asia on its small but hard-hitting menu. Highlights are the sweet and savory Korean Galbi-style short ribs, the crisp and juicy chicken Karage sliders, and the citrusy albacore crudo.

### Redbird

  * Neighborhood: DTLA **•** [114 E 2nd St](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gYxvsoHCeciym7JX7)
  * Cuisine: New American
  * Price: $$$



[Redbird](https://redbird.la) is one of our favorite restaurants in Los Angeles for large groups! You start your meal with small snacks, called “kickshaws”, which are followed by large entrees you can share with the table. The cocktail menu is extensive and praised by both the Michelin Guide and Time Out Magazine, which awarded them Best Restaurant Bar Program. Our best tip is to order generously and share everything! Start by passing around plates of beef tartare, blistered shishito peppers, and roasted figs, and keep the party going by getting the Porterhouse for two, the crispy Branzino, and the Heritage pork chop.

  * Cuisine: Italian



It’s impossible to live in LA and not have heard the buzz around [Mother Wolf](http://motherwolfla.com/). Walk into the epic dining room, and the energy of the space, of the hustling servers, and the patrons dressed to the nines stuffing their faces with pasta will hit you like a wave. Ride that wave all the way to your table and a plateful of the best cacio e pepe you’ve ever had, and you’re sure to be in the mood to party. This is a flashy pick that’s great for a birthday celebrant who wants to see and be seen on their night out on the town.

It doesn’t get much cooler than [Bike Shed Moto Co](https://bikeshedmoto.com). This restaurant is built in a big warehouse in DTLA, and vintage motorcycles are lined up out front. You can get breakfast, lunch, dinner, drinks, a new bike, a haircut, or even a TATTOO here! The burgers here are legendary, and they even have great vegan options. If a great party, in your opinion, requires top-tier pub food and a killer ambiance, Bike Shed Moto Co. is the Place.

[Bistro Na’s](https://www.bistronas.com) serves up imperial-style Chinese food that is fit only for royalty, and today, for birthday royalty! This place does everything with style and flash, including the table-side service of their Peking duck, which requires such elaborate preparation that you have to order it two days in advance. Bistro Na’s menu is full of family-style delicacies, which are perfect for a birthday party. Some menu highlights are the flavorful wok-fried black codfish with ginger and scallion, the sweet and spicy lobster mapo tofu, and the fresh Alaskan king crab four ways.

### République

  * Neighborhood: La Brea **•**[ 624 S La Brea Ave](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YCDc8PEqRQXgxXdN7)
  * Price: $$$
  * Cuisine: French



[République](http://www.republiquela.com/) made it on our [Instagrammable Places to Celebrate Birthday Parties in Los Angeles](https://avitalexperiences.com/resources/instagrammable-places-celebrate-birthday-parties-los-angeles/) post for a reason! But it’s not just about the views at this fabulous French eatery. Start your meal with a fresh baguette with French butter and add on pan drippings to optimize indulgence. Then eat all the fresh raw fish starters you can, because choosing between the hamachi crudo, yellowtail tartare, and Kumamoto oysters is an impossible task! All this before your rich butter-laden French entree even arrives at the table. This is birthday indulgence at its finest, and the pictures alone from this night will be the envy of everyone you know!
