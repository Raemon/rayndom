#  6 Remote Team Building Icebreakers About Food 

May 5, 2020 

Food has an amazing ability to bring people together. Even just talking about food allows people to put down their guard and share something special. That’s why food questions are the perfect remote team building icebreakers. Here are our top six tried-and-true questions to get you started! 

## **Share a quirky food pairing you love.**

Are you a popcorn and pickles lover? Or maybe ketchup and eggs? C.S. Lewis said, “Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another: ‘What! You too? I thought I was the only one.” Sharing your quirky food pairings may be one of the best remote team building icebreakers during your event. 

## **You’re stuck on an island with an unlimited supply of one dish. What is it? Why?**

This question helps to find out your team members’ values. If they say a fruit or vegetable, it’s likely they value a healthy lifestyle. If they say ice cream, you can bet they know the best place to get a scoop in the city! This question helps you learn about your team members quickly. 

## **What’s your go-to comfort dish?**

This question also gives you a peek into your team members’ personal lives. Many times, our comfort foods come from dishes we ate as kids, whether that’s a dish their grandma made every Sunday or a staple dish served at summer camp. 

## **What’s your least favorite food? What don’t you like about it?**

There’s always bonding over foods people despise. Also, it can create for some all-in-good-fun remote team building rivalries. For example, Team Cilantro vs. [Team Tastes Like Soap](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-does-cilantro-taste-bad-like-soap_n_7653808)! 

## **What’s your signature dish to cook?**

Not everyone loves to cook, but most people have a tried-and-true recipe that they’ve been making for years. This question gives people the opportunity to tell a story about the dish, like how they learned to make it. And it’s a great conversation starter for team potlucks down the road. 

## **What’s the first restaurant you’ll go to once quarantine is over?**

This is another great bonding question and a way to think positively while restaurants are still closed. You can even go one step further and ask team members to describe the dish that they’ll be ordering. Cue the mouthwaters! 

If you think your team will enjoy these remote team building icebreakers, consider a culinary experience for your next remote team building activity. [Cook along with expert chefs](http://avitaltours.com/san-francisco/virtual-chefinars/), [mix up a perfect drink with a mixologist](http://avitaltours.com/san-francisco/virtual-mixologist/), or [play fun team building games in our virtual break room](http://avitaltours.com/san-francisco/remote-team-building/).
