Traditional dinners are boring! If every corporate dinner you’ve ever attended has been an uninspired three-course meal, a few glasses of house wine, awkward conversation, and guests who leave the minute the last course comes out, you may be looking for a better alternative. This is exactly why we created our [SF Interactive Meal](https://avitalexperiences.com/experiences/san-francisco-interactive-meal/)! It is a four-course meal at a fabulous restaurant of your choosing, with 3 beverages included. Interspersed between courses are interactive activities like cocktail-making class, food and drink trivia, and a flavor-twisting experience to end the night. Turnkey, unique, and loved by teams.

[Website](https://www.picnicsinthebay.com/)

[Open in Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KTNMW2tfjBzJEQRNA)

If you’ve got a laid back team that are happy to sit, eat, drink, and chat, a picnic might be the perfect team building event. We recommend working with a picnic company, like [Picnics in the Bay](https://www.picnicsinthebay.com/), [Bay Area Picnic Planners](https://bayareapicnicplanners.com/), or [Our Picnic + Co](https://www.ourpicnic.co/) so they can do all the heavy lifting. Otherwise a picnic becomes a lot of work for you (i.e. get a permit, order food, make sure there’s dish ware and decor, organize games, come up with a backup plan for bad weather, etc, etc.!)

Escape Rooms are great team building experiences because you are not getting free without some killer teamwork. These rooms will challenge your team to use strategy, think outside the box, and recognize each other’s unique skills and knowledge. It’s pretty perfect for team building, and companies like [Palace Games](https://palace-games.com/team-building/) even have specific team building packages, so you don’t have to overthink anything but the answer to the first clue!

There are many options for charity team building events in San Francisco, and one of our favorites is teaming up with the [SF Marin Food Bank](https://www.sfmfoodbank.org/corporate-partnership-opportunities/).
