#  17 Best Food Gifts Delivered for 2026 

November 26, 2022 

The foodie craze has come and is here to stay. People all across America and all around the world are getting more and more into learning about the food they eat – and the food they haven’t ever eaten! This trend is not only making the availability of food gifts delivered to your loved ones easier – it’s making them more interesting!

Below we’ve curated a “best of” list of some of our favorite food gifts to give to that special someone in your life. We’re sure you’ll find something that’ll take the cake!

## What are food gifts?

Let’s define what we’re talking about first. Food gifts are gifts that center around food. Pretty simple. However, food gifts delivered to your loved one don’t have to be just food items delivered in a package. Look below to see what we’re talking about! Food gifts can include experiences, gift certificates, and more.

## [![philly-cheese-steak](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![philly-cheese-steak](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/food-gifts-delivered-gold-belly.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/food-gifts-delivered-gold-belly.jpg)

## Gold Belly Gift Card

Give the gift of choice with a Gold Belly gift card. Gold Belly is a site that allows you to order iconic food from all over the country.

But never fear—there’s Gold Belly wearable swag, snack merch, and gift cards! Instead of stressing over which iconic, drool-worthy eats to give them, let them choose for themselves. With this gift, all their dishes will come true! Learn more about buying a [gift with Gold Belly](https://www.goldbelly.com/goldbelly-gift-cards).

## Natural Wine Selection

Natty wine is the new trend hitting the vinous world! This type winemaking is a shift many winemakers are starting to adopt which is basically a wine making process with no pesticides and few to no additives.

Speaking of cases – you should order your giftee a case or subscription of natural wine through MYSA. They aggregate amazing natural wines from all over the world and curate them into a monthly box of your choosing. We think choosing their [Natural Wine Starter Kit ](https://mysa.wine/collections/natural-wine-gifts/products/natural-wine-starter-kit)is a great way to introduce someone to the world of natural wine.

## NY Food Heart Puzzle

_From the site:_

> Restaurants, and the diverse cultures that create them, are what make up the heart of New York. Lockdowns caused by the coronavirus pandemic severely impacted the restaurant industry. Many individuals lost their jobs, while others continued to work tirelessly, ensuring that the heart of NY kept beating. Moved by the impact this had on loved ones, friends Alex, Michelle, and Stephanie created this image to raise awareness around the lack of resources available to hospitality workers, and as a tribute to the industry.
> 
> In response to the economic hardships exacerbated by the pandemic faced by hospitality workers, Areaware supports One Fair Wage, an organization focused on improving wages and workplace equity in the service industry.

Check out this [NY Food Heart Puzzle](https://www.areaware.com/products/puzzle-thing-ny-heart-1?_pos=1&_sid=5cdd1ecc0&_ss=r) that recognizes folks in the service industry.

**Cost:** $35  
**What’s Included:** 465 piece puzzle  
**Why We Love It: Puzzles are great fun, and this one brings to light how important restaurant and food culture is to our souls.**
