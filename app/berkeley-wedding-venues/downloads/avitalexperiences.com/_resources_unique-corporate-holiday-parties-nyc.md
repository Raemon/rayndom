[![corporate-holiday-parties-nyc-people-playing-dodgeball](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![corporate-holiday-parties-nyc-people-playing-dodgeball](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/09/corporate-holiday-parties-nyc-mini-olympics.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/09/corporate-holiday-parties-nyc-mini-olympics.jpg)

### **10\. Holiday Movie and Trivia Night**

This is a great option for a remote or in-person event, or a mix depending on your team and their needs! Pick a classic holiday movie and hold a screening, or you can use different online services to create a virtual screening if you’re hosting a virtual event. 

Before or after the movie, hold a trivia contest about classic holiday films. You can give out tiered prizes for first, second, and third place winners. And, we think it’s fun and conducive to team building if you split everyone up into teams instead of having them do the trivia game alone. Every man for himself does not foster the holiday spirit!

**Why we love it:** This DIY option is great to create a nostalgic event that lets people cozy up, sit back, and relax.

### **11\. Visit the Bryant Park Winter Village**

If your team is brave enough to contend with the elements this holiday season, the [Bryant Park Village](https://bryantpark.org/activities/category/winter-village) market is sure to delight! Vendors selling holiday treats, hot drinks, and an array of wares and gifts line the paths of Bryant Park. This market attracts locals and tourists alike, and it is one of the most highly rated holiday traditions in the Big Apple. 

After strolling around, picking out some holiday gifts, and grabbing a bite to eat, bring your team over to the Lodge Bar, at the center of the market, to gather together (get out of the cold) and enjoy a holiday cocktail.

**Why we love it:** The Bryant Park Winter Village is an essential NYC holiday tradition that will get your coworkers right into the spirit of the season.

Your expert Avital guide will take your team to three Michelin-rated restaurants in the Flat Iron District, where they might be trying dishes like Duck Liver Mousse or Better-Poached Nova Scotia Lobster. It is an incredible tour that will have your coworkers feeling the holiday spirit of generosity!

**Why we love it:** Your coworkers will feel beyond pampered when you take them on our Michelin Food Tour.
