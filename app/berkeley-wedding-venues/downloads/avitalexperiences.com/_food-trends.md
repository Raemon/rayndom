#  Top Food Trends Right Now 

August 31, 2023 

#### **Food Trends for Winter & Holiday 2023/2024**

Winter is upon us, and with the festive season just around the corner, it’s time to explore the culinary wonders that will dominate our tables this year. From innovative cooking techniques to imaginative presentation, the top food trends for Winter and Holidays 2024 promise a feast for the senses. Let’s dive into the gastronomic world that awaits us.

## Tiny Cocktails

Mixologists and enthusiasts alike showcase their creativity by crafting meticulously detailed, sip-sized versions of classic and innovative cocktails. Brands are even developing [miniature glassware](https://punchdrink.com/articles/tiny-glassware-cocktail-guide/) to capitalize on this tiny trend. From the Snaquiri (tiny daiquiri), Mini Tini (tiny martini), and the Snackerac (tiny sazerac), these tiny libations pack a flavorful punch and cater to the drinking less/low ABV movement.

## **Everything Getting Brûléed**

Move over traditional desserts; this winter, everything is getting brûléed! From classic crème brûlée to unexpected savory twists, the art of caramelizing sugar to create a crispy, golden crust is taking the culinary world by storm. Explore the irresistible allure of brûléed goodness that adds a touch of sophistication to your favorite dishes.

> I hereby declare all bries should be brûléed 💁🏻‍♀️😎 recipe below ‼️ Ingredients: 1/4 cup brown sugar 2 teaspoons cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon sea salt 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 tablespoon water 1 cup pecan halves 3 slices prosciutto 1 (8-ounce) wheel of Brie 1 tablespoon honey 1/4 cup granulated sugar 2 tablespoons pomegranate arils 1 teaspoon fresh rosemary leaves, finely chopped Directions: -Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Make the candied pecans. In a nonstick pan over medium heat, add the brown sugar, cinnamon, sea salt, vanilla extract, and water. Stir and cook until the mixture has become thick and melted, about 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and add in the pecan halves, stirring to evenly coat them in the candy mixture. Set aside to cool by spreading them in an even layer on a piece of parchment paper. -Make the crispy prosciutto. Spread prosciutto out on a foil-lined baking sheet and bake until crispy, about 10 minutes. Set aside. -Bake the brie. Carefully remove the top of the brie and drizzle honey on. Bake at 350 on a heat-safe plate until gooey, 5-7 minutes. Sprinkle sugar on top, and using a kitchen torch (or the oven’s broiler function), brûlée the sugar on top until it’s deep brown and all melted. Allow to harden and then top the brie with the candied pecans (broken into small pieces), the crispy prosciutto (broken into small crumbles), the pomegranate arils, and chopped rosemary. Serve with crackers and bread. Enjoy!

You can also check out the video on @colettescocktails to take a closer look. It works with any clear cocktail like a vodka soda or vodka tonic, but also a perfect for sparkling water or any clear mocktail. Such a fun way to serve up a festive drink. NOTE- I heard some concerns about freezing glass. Just make sure yours is freezer safe. And you’re not putting in hot liquid.

#### Food Trends for Fall 2023

As summer comes to an end, food enthusiasts and professionals alike are looking ahead to the exciting new flavors and food trends that fall 2023 has in store. With the changing of the seasons comes a shift in the types of ingredients and dishes that are in demand, and this year is no exception. From frozen fruit granita to Barbie-inspired pastas, there is sure to be something you can’t wait to try in your own kitchen. So, without further ado, let’s take a look at some of the top food trends right now.

## Ice, Ice, Baby

Fancy ice has become a popular trend on social media in recent years, but these past months we’ve seen some serious innovation. This trend involves using high-quality, filtered water to create crystal-clear ice cubes or spheres that are free from impurities. Some people even go as far as to add herbs, fruits, or edible flowers to their ice cubes to add a decorative touch to their drinks. Fancy ice is not only visually appealing but also enhances the taste and overall drinking experience. Many bars and restaurants have started using fancy ice in their cocktails, and it has become a staple in the world of mixology.

## Cake Tacos & Sweet Nachos

Cake tacos and sweet nachos are the latest dessert trend that’s making waves. These delicious treats are a perfect combination of inventive sweet flavors that will tantalize your taste buds. Cake tacos are essentially mini, flat cakes shaped like tortillas that are filled with frosting and other sweet toppings like sprinkles, chocolate chips, and fruit. Sweet nachos, on the other hand, are made using either waffle cones or traditional tortilla chips with a sugar-y coating then topped with whipped cream, fruit, and other sweet toppings. These desserts are perfect for those who want to indulge in something unique and delicious.

## Frozen Fruit Granita

Frozen fruit granita is a refreshing summer dessert that’s perfect for those hot days. And the best thing? It’s made using one single ingredient: the fruit of your choice! Just pop it in the freezer for a few hours then grate it straight into a bowl, over cheese, or whatever your heart desires. This dessert is not only delicious but also healthy as it contains all the natural nutrients of fresh fruit. You can experiment with different fruits to create your own unique flavors like watermelon, lemon, or even mango.

## Cottage Cheese. Yes, Cottage Cheese.

But this isn’t your Great Aunt Betty’s cottage cheese. Cottage cheese is a versatile and healthy food that’s gaining popularity among health enthusiasts. This cheese is made using milk and an acid like vinegar or lemon juice that’s curdled and then drained to remove the whey. It’s being combined with other simple ingredients to make delicious pasta, dips for veggies, or dolloped on a piece of crusty sourdough.

## Painted & Carved Sourdough 

Painted and carved sourdough bread is a new trend that’s taking the bread world by storm. This bread is not only delicious but also visually appealing as it’s adorned with intricate designs and patterns that are carved or painted onto the bread. The designs can be anything from flowers to animals to abstract art, making it a perfect centerpiece for any occasion.

## Conveyor Belt Galore

Long gone are the days when conveyor belt restaurants were reserved for sushi trains only. Today we’re seeing so many creative uses for these food moving machines, like [charcuterie trains](https://www.cultureandco.com/). Conveyor belt restaurants are a new concept that’s revolutionizing the way we eat out. These restaurants have a conveyor belt that runs through the dining area, serving food directly to customers. Customers can choose the dishes they want and enjoy them at their own pace. This concept is perfect for those who want to try different dishes without committing to a full-size entrée.

While some trends may come and go, others will continue to have a lasting impact on the way we approach food. Whatever the future holds, it is safe to say that the food industry will continue to innovate and surprise us with new and exciting trends, and we can’t wait to see what’s next.
