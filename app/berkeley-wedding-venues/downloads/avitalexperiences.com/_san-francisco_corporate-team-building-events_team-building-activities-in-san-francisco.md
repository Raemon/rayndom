## Logistics & Tips for San Francisco Team Building

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/award-icon.svg)

##### Know your goals

Are you aiming for creativity, problem solving, physical energy, or casual bonding? Pick an activity that supports those outcomes.

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/group-size-icon.svg)

##### Match to your team's energy & diversity

Consider mobility, inclusivity, comfort, and interest. Some prefer active outdoor challenges, others want low-pressure culinary or creative sessions.

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/private-food-tour-icon.svg)

##### Permits & public space use

Some outdoor parks or waterfront areas (eg near Embarcadero, Crissy Field) require permits for large groups. Check early.

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/dietary-restriction-icon.svg)

##### Dietary restrictions

If you're serving food or drinks, make sure you have planned for the necessary dietary restrictions so everyone feels included

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/location-icon.svg)

##### Transit & parking

Many venues downtown, in the Marina, or near the Wharf have limited parking; public transit or shuttle may be preferred.

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Restaurant-location-icon.svg)

##### Noise, setup & access

For workshops (eg culinary, cocktail, print classes), ensure the venue has adequate prep space, AV, and loading zones.

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/star-icon.svg)

##### Work with professionals

If you want to sit back and enjoy the experience with your team, consider working with a professional company who can handle all of the details.
