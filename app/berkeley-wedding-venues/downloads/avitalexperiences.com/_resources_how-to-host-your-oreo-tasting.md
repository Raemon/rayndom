#  How to Host Your Own Oreo Tasting 

February 27, 2025

## Let’s break ~~bread~~ Oreos together

March 6 is National Oreo Day. Seriously. Didn’t have it marked on your calendar? Don’t worry, you’re not alone. But now that you  _do_ know, there’s only one thing to do.

![cookie monster from seasame street eating all the cookies](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20480%20270'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![cookie monster from seasame street eating all the cookies](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/cookie-monster-gif.gif)

I’ve always been fascinated by the art of Kintsugi—the Japanese practice of repairing broken pottery with gold, turning imperfections into beauty. It’s not only a stunning art practice but the philosophy goes beyond and has encouraged me both personally and professionally. So when I saw [**Oreo’s Kintsugi-inspired campaign**](https://j0l1y7h.r.us-east-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Ftheinspiration.com%2F2024%2F06%2Foreo-kintsugi-by-leo-burnett-tailor-made-sao-paulo%2F/1/0100019547d70c35-0d0a8271-8c7f-4031-af92-e967ec13d7e1-000000/jhTW8vGOIsXNT7vme8j9V99HE3w=415), I was immediately inspired.

I promptly ordered  _nine_ different limited-edition Oreo flavors. Because obviously, another comparative tasting was in order—this time, **[much less stinky](https://avitalexperiences.com/resources/how-to-host-your-own-tinned-fish-tasting/)**.

## My Oreo Tasting

To start, I separated the nine Oreo flavors into three categories: vanilla cookies, chocolate cookies, and fruit fillings:

**Vanilla Cookies**

  * Lemon
  * Cinnamon Bun
  * Sour Patch Kids



**Chocolate Cookies**

  * Birthday Cake (Chinese version)
  * Birthday Cake (U.S. version)
  * Toffee Crunch



**Chocolate Cookies with Fruit Filling**

  * Blueberry & Raspberry
  * Peach & Oolong Tea
  * Peach & Grape



![medium_large](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20768%20606'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![medium_large](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/oreo-tasting-768x606.png)

Then, the tasting began! Instead of eating the whole cookie, I took just a bite of each one, making sure to get both cookie and cream. My training as a wine sommelier helped me here. 

After tasting each cookie, I chose my favorites:

![medium_large](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20768%20606'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![medium_large](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/oreo-tasting-winners-768x606.png)

I had so much fun with this tasting (as did my 3-year old son!) If you’d like to celebrate National Oreo Day with your own Oreo tasting, here’s how. It’s great for families or even for a fun lunch activity at work. 

## How to Host Your Own Oreo Tasting

![medium](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![medium](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/different-oreo-packages-on-blue-background-150x150.jpg)

##### **01: Gather Your Oreos**

Choose a variety of Oreo flavors to compare—pick a mix of classic, limited-edition, and international flavors. My top picks are available on my Amazon shopping list.

[Shop Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2R533SZFDSN24?ref_=wl_share)

![medium](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![medium](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/split-screen-of-chocolate-and-vanilla-oreos-150x150.jpg)

##### **02: Sort by Category**

There are several different categories depending on what Oreos you select. But one of the easiest is to split between chocolate cookies and vanilla cookies.

![medium](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![medium](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/hand-reaching-to-plate-of-two-oreos-150x150.jpg)

##### **03:****Observe, Taste, & Smell**

Start with tasting all the flavors in one category before moving on to the next. Think about the color, smell, and texture in addition to the flavor. For even more fun, consider adding different milks to the tasting!

![medium](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![medium](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/tinned-fish-tasting-notes-card-on-table-top-150x150.jpg)

##### **04: Take Notes**

Jot down your impressions of each Oreo. Notice the differences in color, smell, and flavor. Download our tasting notes template to get started.

##### **05: Choose Winners**

When you’re done, crown a winner in each category. But let’s be real, you just ate nine cookies. You’re the winner.
