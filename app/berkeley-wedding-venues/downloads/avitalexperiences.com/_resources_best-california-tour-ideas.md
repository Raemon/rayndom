#  The 10 Best California Tour Ideas 

August 30, 2016 

Most visitors to California spend at least sometime driving along the Pacific Coast Highway (which is also known as Highway 1). Between San Diego and San Francisco there are dozens of stops to make and it can be overwhelming to plans. These California tours can help break up a trip and give a more in depth look at some locations. Here are our favorite California tour ideas to help break up your drive, add some quirkiness to your experience and give you a little more background about the California coast.

# 10 Best California Tour Ideas

[![people singing in San Francisco on Wild SF tour in California](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20945'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![people singing in San Francisco on Wild SF tour in California](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/08/California-Tour-Wild-SF-Tours.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/08/California-Tour-Wild-SF-Tours.jpg)

  1. ## Sing in San Francisco




The San Francisco hills are alive with the sound of music. [Wild SF](http://wildsftours.com/) offers a “Free Love and the 1960’s” tour in which the guide carries a guitar and sings songs from Janis Joplin, the Grateful Dead, Hell’s Angels, the Diggers, and more. Embrace your past hippie (or current hippie or inner hippie) and groove along with the soundtrack to the Summer of Love.

[![bartender pouring cocktails at bar in San Francisco](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20671%20400'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![bartender pouring cocktails at bar in San Francisco](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/08/California-Tour-Craft-Cocktail-Tour-in-SF.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/08/California-Tour-Craft-Cocktail-Tour-in-SF.jpg)

  2. ## Stop for (a Few) Cocktails




Explore downtown San Francisco with [a craft cocktail tour](http://avitaltours.com/san-francisco/tour/union-square-cocktail-tour/) from Avital Tours. The two hour tour will make three stops at downtown bars that the company believes showcases the best story and the best cocktails in Union Square. You’ll meet bar owners, bartenders and industry experts while learning about mixology and San Francisco’s integral role in the revival of the cocktail culture.

[![Winchester Mystery House in San Jose](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201280%20640'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Winchester Mystery House in San Jose](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/08/California-Tour-Winchester-Mystery-House.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/08/California-Tour-Winchester-Mystery-House.jpg)

  3. ## Visit a Haunted House




You’ll see a lot of signs for the [Winchester Mystery House](http://www.sanjosetours.net/offer/12017/Winchester-Mystery-House-Tickets) on your drive. Follow your curiosity and learn about the tragedy of the Winchester family that led to the supposed haunting of the house that led heiress Sarah to build a house so complex it would trick evil spirits. Explore the house of oddities and strange spaces in San Jose, just 50 miles from San Francisco.

## 4\. Go Big (Sur)

Big Sur is a must when driving up the coast. It’s beautiful by car and on foot when hiking, but a really unique way to see the sights is [from a helicopter.](https://www.viator.com/tours/Monterey-and-Carmel/Monterey-Bay-Big-Sur-Helicopter-Tour/d5250-15226GRAND) Your hour-long flight will leave from Monterey and go along the central coast to Big Sur. You’ll also fly over Carmel. Helicopter pilots provide commentary as you fly over the oft photographer sites like Bixby Creek Bridge.

## [![Hearst Castle in San Simeon California](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20795%20505'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Hearst Castle in San Simeon California](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/08/California-Tour-Hearst-Castle.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/08/California-Tour-Hearst-Castle.jpg)5\. Tour Hearst Castle

You’ll be passing some gorgeous beach-front homes on your drive, but if you want to tour an actual castle, or as close as you can get to one in California, stop at [Hearst Castle](http://hearstcastle.org/) in San Simeon. There are multiple tours depending if you want to see the grand rooms, cottages and kitchens, the upstairs suites, or tour the grounds in the evening. With 165 rooms and127 acres of gardens, terraces, pools, and walkways, it’s easy to take a break from driving and spend a day touring this massive property.

[![kayaker in Morro Bay California](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20604%20452'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![kayaker in Morro Bay California](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/08/California-Tour-kayak-in-morro-bay.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/08/California-Tour-kayak-in-morro-bay.jpg)

## 6\. Rock the Boat

Stretch your legs and [get in a kayak](http://www.centralcoastoutdoors.com/kayaking-morro-bay-california/) to best see Morro Bay. Central Coast Outdoors hosts trips with nature guides who will be able to tell you all about the otters, sea lions, harbor seals, and birds you might see on your journey. Choose from a half day, short paddle, sunset paddle, or private tour.

[![Santa Barbara Vineyards in California](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201600%201003'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Santa Barbara Vineyards in California](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/08/California-Tour-santa-barbara-vineyards.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/08/California-Tour-santa-barbara-vineyards.jpg)

## 7\. Tour Santa Barbara Vineyards

Most visitors think of Napa as the wine capital of California, but southern California has its own wine scene in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo. Visit four wineries and have a catered lunch with [Grapeline Wine Tours. Remember, when someone else is driving you really get to focus on the wine.](https://gogrape.com/santa-barbara/)

## [![avita food tour in venice beach california](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%202200%201467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![avita food tour in venice beach california](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/08/Katie-Edwards.-Venice-Beach.-Guests-cheersing-with-wine-at-Plant-Food-and-Wine.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/08/Katie-Edwards.-Venice-Beach.-Guests-cheersing-with-wine-at-Plant-Food-and-Wine.jpg)

## 8\. Eat At Venice Beach

Between Muscle Beach, the canals, and artists along the board walk, Venice Beach is a must-stop on your trip. Explore the Venice food scene with an [Avital Tours](http://avitaltours.com/los-angeles/tour/venice-beach-food-tour/) culinary experience that will let you try four restaurants in three hours. You’ll explore Rose Avenue and Abbot Kinney while dining at local favorites such as Venice Ale House, Gjelina, The Anchor, and Blue Star Donuts.

[![museum of neon art in Loa Angeles California](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%202048%201152'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![museum of neon art in Loa Angeles California](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/08/California-Tour-neon-tour.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/08/California-Tour-neon-tour.jpg)

## 9\. Check Out LA’s Neon Lights

Ditch the Hollywood Star Tour and instead climb aboard the unique [Neon Cruise](http://www.new-neonmona.org/about/). Hosted by the Museum of Neon Art, the double decker convertible will take you on a three hour tour of different neon art throughout Los Angeles. Don’t worry about getting hungry-there’s an intermission where you can eat or dink. Your guide will be Eric Lynxwiler who has 15 years of experience and knows all about local Hollywood and downtown culture, history, art, architecture, and of course, neon.

## [![beer flight at San Diego brewery](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20900'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![beer flight at San Diego brewery](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/08/California-Tour-San-Diego-Brewery.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/08/California-Tour-San-Diego-Brewery.jpg)

## 10\. Drink Well in San Diego

San Diego is the craft beer capital of California. [With more than 100 breweries](http://www.sandiego.org/articles/breweries/san-diego-breweries.aspx), there’s a lot of beer waiting for you, but it can be a bit overwhelming to navigate them all. How do you fit in Ballast Point and Belching Beaver and Modern Times? Luckily companies like [Brewery Tours of San Diego ](http://brewerytoursofsandiego.com/) have afternoon and evening tours that come with beer tastings, transportation, a souvenir glass, and a meal. Tours stop at local favorites such as Mission Brewery, Pizza Port, Green Flash, and Ale Smith. Afterwards wander the town for fish tacos or a California burrito, which has French fries in it…the perfect post tour meal.
