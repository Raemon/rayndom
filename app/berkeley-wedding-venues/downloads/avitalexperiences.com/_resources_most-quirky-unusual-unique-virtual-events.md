February 22, 2021 

Got Zoom fatigue? Us too! With long webinars, daily virtual meetings, and even family and friend functions happening via screen, _unique_ virtual events are more important than ever. 

And when it comes to shaking things up, [Team Avital](http://avitaltours.com/virtual-events/) tends to turn to the quirky side of things. We’ve scoured the internet to bring you these amazing novelty experiences that are sure to keep your team entertained and engaged. We’ve also included a few of our very own unique virtual events:

  * [Virtual Flavor Tripping](http://avitaltours.com/virtual-flavor-tripping/)
  * [Virtual Water Tasting ](http://avitaltours.com/virtual-water-tasting/)
  * [Virtual Aperitif Hour](http://avitaltours.com/virtual-wine-tasting/)



You won’t find any overused icebreakers, virtual trust falls, or long boring presentations on this list. Keep reading for the most quirky, unusual, and unique virtual events! The kind that will make your team excited to log onto the event early! 

## **[![flavor kit delivered during virtual flavor tripping event](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![flavor kit delivered during virtual flavor tripping event](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/virtual-flavor-tripping-setup-unique-virtual-event.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/virtual-flavor-tripping-setup-unique-virtual-event.jpg)  
1\. Trick your senses with flavor tripping**

[Flavor tripping is a unique, sensory experience](https://avitalexperiences.com/experiences/virtual-tongue-twister-tasting/) all about changing your perception of flavor. Using Miracle Berries, little red berries from Africa, change anything sour into something deliciously sweet. While you learn about flavor, you also learn about how it impacts everyone differently, as well as getting a chance to know each other. It’s a unique, mind-bending experience with great team-building results.

![team in zoom during unique virtual event](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![team in zoom during unique virtual event](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/kindness-quest-for-unique-virtual-events.jpg)Image via teambuilding.com

## **2\. Go on a Kindness Quest**

Practice gratitude and appreciation with your team on a [Kindness Quest](https://teambuilding.com/events/kindness-quest). You’ll play games and activities that inspire kindness, in addition to contributing to the community. Although this is done around the holiday season, you can replicate some of these activities throughout the year. 

![unicorn vodka for unique virtual event](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![unicorn vodka for unique virtual event](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/blue-cocktail-for-unique-virtual-events.jpg)Image via Unicorn Vodka

## **3\. Transform a virtual happy hour with color-changing vodka**

Yes, really — there’s a [vodka](https://unicorn.vodka/vodka/) that pours as a cobalt blue, and changes when you turn it into a cocktail. Have everyone pick up a bottle or send one to each of your guests’ homes, and challenge everyone to see what color they can come up with. Whether it’s pink, purple, or blue, it will take your virtual event from normal to unique. 

![person making tiny smore during unique virtual event](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![person making tiny smore during unique virtual event](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/tiny-campfire-for-unique-virtual-events.jpg)Image via teambuilding.com

## **4\. Hang out around the (tiny) campfire together**

It’s summer camp with all the fun and no teenage awkwardness! The [tiny campfire](https://tinycampfire.com/) team sends you a list of everything you need to set up a small (and safe!) campfire inside, and the counselors provide the scary stories and games. If you’re looking for quirky virtual events, this is one of our favorites. 

## **![easter bunny looking for eggs during unique virtual events](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![easter bunny looking for eggs during unique virtual events](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/bunny-escape-game-unique-virtual-event.jpg)  
5\. Take a quick break and help a cute bunny find her home**

This quick, cute, (and free!) unique virtual event [helps the Easter bunny find her way home](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSelrNDLCs8-ARgFwKmYznCwcsaxsTN_WSjilGKde0X5TQTp8A/viewform) after a long night of hiding eggs. It’s a great way to get the kids involved so you can all solve the puzzle together. You could even make it a theme with eggsalad for lunch!

## **![paint a unicorn during unique virtual events](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![paint a unicorn during unique virtual events](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/spreadsheet-painting-for-unique-virtual-events.jpg)  
6\. Paint a dabbing unicorn together**

Paint by numbers gets a new meaning. Create a google sheet or use a template like [this one](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X5SB9qxtxuyJFLsSpnkLP92d7eNPQzApX0DIJGLQww4/edit#gid=1629905998) that allows everyone to fill in with colors. Break up the event into smaller teams and see what everyone comes up with, use it as a meeting intro or a breakout for a virtual conference. It’s an easy, creative activity to add some extra engagement to the day. 

![group show calculators on screen during unique virtual events](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![group show calculators on screen during unique virtual events](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/hire-magician-for-unique-virtual-events.jpg)Image via The Vendry

## **7\. Add a little magic to your virtual event**

With [the help of a magician](https://www.thevendry.co/services/all/virtual-events-magic-acts?t=13&st=25), you can transform your virtual event into something with a little more pizazz! No rabbits or top hats needed. Sit back and be amazed at how these magicians still manage to put on a magical show without a live audience. 

## **![family doing improv during unique virtual events](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![family doing improv during unique virtual events](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/improv-class-for-unique-virtual-events.jpg)  
8\. Test your improv skills**

Improv Night might sound a bit intimidating at first, but a few classic improv games might be what your virtual events need to spice them up. Here’s [a list of improv games](https://performerstuff.com/mgs/10-of-the-best-virtual-improvisation-games-for-distance-learning/) that work well for Zoom. Another bonus is that improv can help improve communication skills in the workplace, so it’s a win-win.
