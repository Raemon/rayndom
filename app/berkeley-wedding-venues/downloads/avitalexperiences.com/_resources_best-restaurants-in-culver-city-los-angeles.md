##### Ugo Cafe

[ Website ](https://www.cafeugo.com) · [ Open in Google Maps ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/44Bxi96FnMe94FXL9)

Ugo Cafe is one of only 94 restaurants in the US that is VPN certified, which means that a special committee guarantees that they are serving authentic Neopolitan Pizza that abides by the traditions and standards of how it was made hundreds of years ago in Naples.

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/juliet.laPNG_-150x150.jpg)

Michelin-Recommended restaurant serving West Coast seafood with classic French cooking techniques. For a fancy night out, order “Le Omakase” six-course menu.

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mensho.com_-150x150.jpg)

##### Mensho Tokyo

[ Website ](https://mensho.com) · [ Open in Google Maps ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nmNikzDsBXDzqfM1A)

The earthy matcha ramen with melt-in-your-mouth pork is completely original, the fatty Wagyu ramen is a divine experience, and their classic tonkotsu ramen will prove you don’t need fancy flavors to rank far above all other ramen in the area! 

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Casey-Robinson_Vespertine--150x150.jpg)

##### Vespertine

[ Website ](https://vespertine.la) · [ Open in Google Maps ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FehXP8ZChUfqURbz7)

two-Michelin-star restaurant that has helped put Culver City on the map as a food destination in Los Angeles. They are also awarded a green star by Michelin for their sustainability practices, so it’s a restaurant you can feel good about supporting. 

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/hatchethallla.com_-150x150.jpg)

##### Hatchet Hall

[ Website ](https://www.hatchethallla.com) · [ Open in Google Maps ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bkDYBbUHrdP3BfLi7)

Order the spicy, cheesy, cast-iron cornbread for the table, then pile on the appetizers like pink scallop crudo, smoked ocean trout dip, and brown butter honey dates. Don't forget to check out the secret The Old Man Bar.

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/destroyer.la_-150x150.jpg)

##### Destroyer

[ Website ](https://destroyer.la) · [ Open in Google Maps ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2FkvHCJT2ApQiJse7)

The more casual sister of Vespertine. Our favorite dishes are the sweet potato waffle with a gruyère and prosciutto emulsion, beef tartare with smoked egg cream, and pickled mushrooms.

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/7.-@mayurarestaurant-150x150.jpg)

##### Mayura

[ Website ](https://mayura-indian-restaurant.com) · [ Open in Google Maps ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WLzPdLuUj8GutK8b9)

The owners are from the Kerala region of Southeast India, and something very special about Mayura is that you can find a lot of dishes you don’t often see in America at Indian food restaurants, because they are specifically from this less-represented region. Dedicated vegetarian kitchen makes it great for dietary restrictions. 

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/8.-@kusano_culver_city-150x150.jpg)

##### Kusano (MR)

[ Website ](http://resy.com/link?venue_id=84689) · [ Open in Google Maps ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3sFRPJSTPXNkeY4w5)

A Michelin-guide, one-man operation, delivering a high-quality omakase experience to only sixteen people a night. Chef Yasu Kusano does everything, from preparing every perfect dish to pouring your drink to washing the dishes at the end of the night. 

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/9cafe-brasil.com_-150x150.jpg)

##### Café Brasil

[ Website ](https://www.cafe-brasil.com) · [ Open in Google Maps ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EFf4XVmdqwU15FYE9)

Casual Brazilian food restaurant with flavorful dishes, a great happy hour menu, and all-day breakfast. They also have great lunch specials at unbeatable prices, like the fresh tilapia with rice, beans, and plantains for only $16, and the juicy top sirloin steak for the same price. 

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pastasisters.com_-150x150.jpeg)

##### Pasta Sisters

[ Website ](https://www.pastasisters.com) · [ Open in Google Maps ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6nW9ZVci29eX3hq56)

A family-run restaurant with rich history and even richer pastas, made in-house every day. The arrabiata is delightfully spicy, and if you add the burrata, it becomes a creamy, zingy masterpiece. The indulgent porcini mushroom pasta with cream and parsley is also a menu highlight. 

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dearjohnsbar.com_-150x150.webp)

##### Dear John’s

[ Website ](https://www.dearjohnsbar.com) · [ Open in Google Maps ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/u1NfHtNsZ4L7XHFK9)

Watering hole dating back to the 1960s. Dine on a phenomenal steak or lobster thermidor, while you sip on a Vesper or Hemingway, and find yourself transported to the days when Frank Sinatra played the piano in the corner.

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/robertaspizza.com_culver-city-150x150.jpeg)

##### Roberta’s

[ Website ](https://www.robertaspizza.com/culver-city) · [ Open in Google Maps ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Dfy88tKXaQLouzSu7)

A great place to celebrate a birthday. Start with the antipasti, then order pizzas for the table, like the “Lupo” with green garlic, smoked mozzarella, and mortadella, or the “Bee Sting” with soppressata, chili, and honey.

![medium_large](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20300%20233'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![medium_large](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/group-making-cocktails-during-avitals-interactive-meal-at-one-of-best-restaurants-in-culver-city-los-angeles--300x233.jpg)
