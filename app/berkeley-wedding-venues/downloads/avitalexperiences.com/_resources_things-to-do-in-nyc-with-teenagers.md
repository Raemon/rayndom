![medium_large](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/museum-of-ice-cream-manhattan-nyc-courtesy-002-768x512.jpeg)

Whether you are visiting New York for the first time, or you’re looking to spend a fun weekend in town as a local, this guide will help you craft the perfect itinerary of the best things to do in NYC with a teenager.

We’ve got the inside scoop on how to keep a teenager entertained, from taking them on a [food tour](https://avitalexperiences.com/new-york-city/), to spending the day at Coney Island or the Baseball Diamond. This list will give you all the inspiration you need when it comes to finding fun things to do in NYC with a teenager.

## A few of our favorite things to do with teenagers in NYC:

  * Book a [walking food tour](https://avitalexperiences.com/new-york-city/walking-food-tours/) and enjoy great eats while hearing stories about the city
  * Take in the beautiful views on and around the The Statue of Liberty
  * Stroll through a world-renowned Art Museum
  * Explore parks, zoos, and botanical gardens



## In this post, you’ll find:

  * Fun activities for you and your teen in New York City
  * Ideas for outings that are fun for the whole family
  * Things to do during Spring and Summer Break in NYC with teens
  * Activities perfect for teens who enjoy food, amusement parks, museums, art, and athletics



## 1\. Take A Walking Food Tour of the East Village

![east village food tour group stopping for a selfie](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20768'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![east village food tour group stopping for a selfie](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/east-village-food-tour-group-stopping-for-a-selfie-1024x768.jpg)

Join other food-loving travelers for an [East Village Food Tour](https://avitalexperiences.com/experiences/new-york-city-east-village-food-tour/)! The story of the East Village is the story of the immigrants, punk rockers, artists, students, and chefs who risked it all to make their home here. This tour will show you that the cuisine of the East Village is just as diverse, rich, and powerful as the stories of the people who brought it here. 

If you would like to upgrade your experience, we have three perfect beverage pairings on offer, including high-quality non-alcoholic options for teens. Without spoiling the surprise, some dishes you might get to sample on this tour would be: fiery Szechuan Dry Pot, comforting Lebanese Kibbeh Kras, and classic Italian Cheesecake!

## 2\. See a Broadway Show

![times square at night with lights, cars, and people](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20963%20642'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![times square at night with lights, cars, and people](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/times-square-at-night-with-lights-cars-and-people.jpg)

You can’t leave New York without seeing a show! Broadway is one of the greatest cultural institutions in the city and it has diverse offerings that are great for people of all ages. 

You and your teen can head to the [TKTS booth](https://www.tdf.org/discount-ticket-programs/tkts-by-tdf/?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22333652546&gbraid=0AAAAA-_vZcVEJ05K1pqP4VQys6OE1UYPf&gclid=Cj0KCQjwmqPDBhCAARIsADorxIZ-ifbf0KCKI6UBqSERlvZTlHosq2mc8xYD-iNy3nYhvDtXNX5tVyQaAjq1EALw_wcB) in Times Square or at Lincoln Center to check out what shows are playing each day and take advantage of the discount prices they offer. The Patron Services team will be happy to help you and your teen pick out a show that is age appropriate and sure to entertain you both.

A pro-tip is to also look into Off-Broadway shows. A common misconception is that Off-Broadway shows have a lower caliber of talent and production value, but that is far from true. Off-Broadway just means the theater has 100-499 seats rather than 500+ seats. You get the same level of talent and often production value for a significantly lower price!

## 3\. Plan a Day Trip to Coney Island

![close up shot of amusement part ride at coney island](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20963%20642'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![close up shot of amusement part ride at coney island](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/close-up-shot-of-amusement-part-ride-at-coney-island.jpg)

You might not think of New York City as a destination for a day at the beach, but Coney Island will change your opinion! This beach town combines the nostalgia and retro-vibes of the boardwalk with contemporary entertainment and amusement park rides.

**See the Aquarium:** [The New York Aquarium](https://nyaquarium.com) in Coney Island is home to over 500 different species of marine life. Don’t miss the “Spineless Exhibit” which showcases incredible invertebrate species like octopus and jellyfish.

**Luna Park rides:** [Luna Park](https://lunaparknyc.com/) is NYC’s biggest amusement park with a history spanning back to 1903. The Cyclone and Thunderbolt are iconic in the rollercoaster community, so if your teen is a thrill seeker you have to buy them a few rides!

**Visit[Deno’s Amusement Park](https://www.denoswonderwheel.com):** You may have already heard of the Wonder Wheel at Deno’s Amusement Park, as it is Coney Island’s most iconic landmark. Luna Park might have bigger and faster coaster’s but you shouldn’t overlook the old school charm of the rides at Deno’s or miss out on the remarkable views from the top of the Wonder Wheel.

**Eat at[Nathan’s Famous](https://nathansfamous.com):** It wouldn’t be a complete Coney Island experience without eating at Nathan’s Famous! This is the hot dog spot that lays claim to its very invention. In the city that made the street hot dog iconic you can’t miss out on trying the OG.

## 4\. Take a Cruise Around the Statue of Liberty

![boat parked in front of statue of liberty](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20963%20642'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![boat parked in front of statue of liberty](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/boat-parked-in-front-of-statue-of-liberty.jpg)

The Statue of Liberty is one of New York’s most iconic landmarks, and there’s no better way to experience it for the first time than on a boat in the beautiful New York Harbor. You can take a [ferry](https://www.cityexperiences.com/new-york/city-cruises/statue/) from Battery Park or Liberty State Park to see this incredible landmark.

Pro-tip: book your tickets in advance. This is a big tourist attraction and it does get sold out. Particularly if you are interested in [Crown Access](https://www.nps.gov/stli/planyourvisit/visit-the-crown.htm)—meaning you get off the Ferry, traverse the 162 steps inside the statue and get to experience views of the city from the windows in Lady Liberty’s Crown—you should grab tickets as soon as you can.

## 5\. Catch a Baseball Game

![exterior shot of yankee stadium in nyc](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20963%20642'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![exterior shot of yankee stadium in nyc](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/exterior-shot-of-yankee-stadium-in-nyc.jpg)

NYC is home to two major league baseball teams, and many minor league baseball teams as well. If your teen is a sports fanatic you have to treat them to a day at one of these stadiums:

**[New York Yankees](https://www.mlb.com/yankees/tickets/single-game-tickets?mlbkw=ds-g-&gclsrc=aw.ds&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22348315121&gbraid=0AAAAADvw9btPSGxsGIGF5EE0PsSi64zCT&gclid=Cj0KCQjwmqPDBhCAARIsADorxIbMjQ-6dw5EidqvZhQy2JzzDMA40xiLnGoH2wP5rE3nVTHoy2SUc3oaAmyFEALw_wcB) (Bronx)**: The Yankees are the pride of the Bronx! The stadium is massive and packed with food and drink options. There’s even an on-site Museum, so you can truly make a whole day of visiting Yankee Stadium, and catching a game.

**[New York Mets](https://www.mlb.com/mets) (Queens): **The Mets may not have the same history as the Yankees, but they’re still a very popular team to go and watch. Check out family Sundays, where you and your teen can meet Mr. and Mrs. Mett and play games on the field.

**[Brooklyn Cyclones](https://www.milb.com/brooklyn) (Coney Island)**: Even the minor league teams pull out all the stops in New York. Check out a Brooklyn Cyclones game on Friday’s to experience fireworks as well as a great game of baseball!

**[Staten Island Ferry Hawks](https://ferryhawks.com) (Staten Island)**: This stadium is right off the ferry so you can enjoy a beautiful ride on the water before your game. They offer an activity where kids can run the bases after the game, which your teen may enjoy.

## 6\. Feed Your Sweet Tooth at the Museum of Ice Cream

![teens dancing at museum of ice cream in nyc](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20683'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![teens dancing at museum of ice cream in nyc](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/museum-of-ice-cream-manhattan-nyc-courtesy-002-1024x683.jpeg)Image Credit: museumoficecream.com

If your teen loves ice cream and good photo ops, the [Museum of Ice Cream](https://www.museumoficecream.com) is a must visit! It’s a simple concept that combines colorful immersive exhibits with ice cream tasting. Although it is simple on paper it is very effective in holding a teenagers attention for a couple of hours, and satisfying their sugar cravings!

## 7\. Relax and People-Watch at the Park

![people watching at central park is one of the best things to do in nyc with teenagers](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20963%20642'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![people watching at central park is one of the best things to do in nyc with teenagers](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/people-watching-at-central-park-is-one-of-the-best-things-to-do-in-nyc-with-teenagers.jpg)

New York is home to many beautiful parks where you can take scenic walks, bike, or even be chauffeured around via a horse-drawn carriage or rickshaw. You may have heard of Central Park, but that’s not your only option for a beautiful park experience.

**[Central Park](https://www.centralparknyc.org)** : You can’t go wrong with the classics! Highlights of Central Park are the ice-skating during the winter, the liveliness of the great lawn and Sheeps Meadow during the summer (where hundreds of New Yorkers come out to enjoy the good weather) and the strip through the center of the park where you can buy small trinkets and souvenirs.

**[Prospect Park](https://www.prospectpark.org)** : This park was designed by the same person who created Central park, but it is a little smaller, and far less crowded. You can grab a city bike nearby, and enjoy a phenomenal bike ride on their slightly less than 3.5 mile loop.

**[Riverside Park](https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/riverside-park/)** : Stretching from 72nd-158th, Riverside Park might not be the biggest park in New York, but it certainly is the longest. The best part of Riverside Park is that there’s something new to see every couple of blocks, from restaurants, to art installations, to tennis and basketball games being played.

## 8\. Visit the American Museum of Natural History

![people looking at dinosaur fossils in museum](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20963%20642'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![people looking at dinosaur fossils in museum](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/people-looking-at-dinosaur-fossils-in-museum.jpg)

There are many fabulous museums in New York, but if your teen doesn’t get excited by art, the [American Museum of Natural History](https://www.amnh.org) has something else to offer. They are known for having one of the biggest collections of dinosaur fossils in the world, and it is truly spectacular to behold.

The diversity of exhibits in this museum means that there’s something for everyone. Whether your teenager is interested in anthropology, gemstones, fossils, science, or space, The Natural History Museum will have an exhibit for them to enjoy. 

They also offer many immersive exhibits which can add a lot to your teens Museum experience. The Invisible Worlds exhibit is particularly special. You will be immersed in projections of all the wonders of the natural world, from those that are too small to see to those that are too massive to comprehend. It’s a magical experience that many highlight as the best part of their visit.

## 9\. See a Concert

![two teens in nyc at concert](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20963%20642'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![two teens in nyc at concert](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/two-teens-in-nyc-at-concert.jpg)

Every kind of musician dreams of making a pilgrimage to New York to play a show at some point in their career. You and your teen might even be lucky enough to catch one of their favorite performers while you’re in town. Here are some venues to start your search for a great concert.

**[The Bowery Ballroom](https://mercuryeastpresents.com/boweryballroom/):** The Bowery ballroom gets many indie artists, and singer-songwriters playing shows at their venue. The space feels like a big ballroom where you and your friends are having a dance party to great music, making it a very special place.

**[Madison Square Garden](https://www.msg.com/madison-square-garden):** If your teen is a big commercial pop and rock fan your best bet is to look at the Madison Square Garden lineup. MSG can hold up to 19,500 people making it an unparalleled venue for the biggest stars to play massive shows at.

**[Beacon Theatre](https://www.msg.com/beacon-theatre):** The Beacon Theatre often has similar acts performing as the Bowery Ballroom, but rather than a venue to stand and dance, it is one to sit and enjoy the show. The interior of the theater is absolutely beautiful, and it has great acoustics making it a popular choice for concert-goers.

**[Radio City](https://www.msg.com/radio-city-music-hall):** Radio City is not only home to the Rockettes, they also host bands, and other musical artists. This is an iconic venue, so many big music artists play here as a career milestone, and you can catch some popular commercial artists. This is also a great venue to take your teenager to because there are many shops and restaurants in the area you can explore before your show.

## 10\. Treat your Teen to a Michelin Meal 

![family with teen visit michelin restaurant during michelin food tour in nyc](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20963%20642'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![family with teen visit michelin restaurant during michelin food tour in nyc](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/family-with-teen-visit-michelin-restaurant-during-michelin-food-tour-in-nyc.jpg)

Or for something truly special, consider a [Michelin food tour](https://avitalexperiences.com/experiences/new-york-city-michelin-food-tour/), where you’ll visit 3 different Michelin restaurants over the course of a single meal. A must-do for aspiring chefs and foodie teens. 

## 11\. Visit the Botanical Gardens

![mom and son walking through botanical gardens in nyc](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20963%20642'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![mom and son walking through botanical gardens in nyc](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/mom-and-son-walking-through-botanical-gardens-in-nyc.jpg)

New York has many Botanical Gardens for you and your teenager to explore. You’ll be amazed by what kind of flora and fauna can be cultivated on the East Coast!

If you’re looking to add a touch of culture to your city trip, a ballet or opera can do just that! These institutions might be thought of as sort of stuffy by younger people, but in the city where art is always pushing the envelope, these theaters prove that idea to be incorrect.

**[New York City Ballet at Lincoln Center](https://www.nycballet.com):** The New York City Ballet is world renown for their dancers athleticism and the contemporary ballets they perform.

## 14\. Visit an Art Museum

![teen looks at art piece in nyc art museum](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20963%20642'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![teen looks at art piece in nyc art museum](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/teen-looks-at-art-piece-in-nyc-art-museum.jpg)

If your teen loves visual art, you have to take them to an art museum while you’re in town. New York City has some of the most prolific art museums in the United States, and no matter what kind of art your teenager is drawn to there’s a gallery in the city that’s perfect for them.

**[The Metropolitan Museum of Art](https://www.metmuseum.org):** When you think of art museums in New York, the Met definitely has the best name recognition. This is in part because it is home to world-renowned paintings like “Washington Crossing the Delaware,” by Emanuelle Letz, “Self-Portrait with Straw Hat,” by Vincent Van Gogh, “Bridge Over Pond of Water Lilies” by Clause Monet, and pieces by acclaimed artists such as Georgia O’Keefe, Edward Degas, Alexander Calder, Jackson Pollock, and so many more.

[**The MOMA**](https://www.moma.org): If your teen enjoys modern art the MOMA is the place to take them. Don’t miss out on seeing “Starry Night” by Vincent Van Gogh, “Water Lilies” by Claude Monet, or “The Red Studio” by Henri Matisse.

**[The Whitney](https://whitney.org):** The Whitney has an incredible collection of American art. You can see iconic pieces by Edward Hopper, Georgia O’Keefe, Mark Rothko and Alexander Calder. They also have beautiful outdoor balconies where you can view the city and have a snack and drink.

[**The Gugenheim**](https://www.guggenheim.org): The Guggenheim is visually stunning the minute you approach it from the street. It is one of Frank Lloyd Wright’s incredible architectural creations. This museum has a mix of the modern and classical so it could be a good middle ground if you and your teen have different taste in art.

## 15\. Ride the Staten Island Ferry

![staten island ferry with statue of liberty in background](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20963%20642'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![staten island ferry with statue of liberty in background](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/staten-island-ferry-with-statue-of-liberty-in-background.jpg)

If you’re looking for a free way to experience some of the most iconic views of New York City, [the Staten Island Ferry](https://siferry.com) has you covered. You get a gorgeous look at the Statue of Liberty as well as the Manhattan skyline. It also has the perk of running 24/7 so if you ever need to get from Staten Island to the city or vice versa, the ferry has got you covered!

## 16\. Go to the Zoo

![family with teens visit zoo in new york](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20963%20642'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![family with teens visit zoo in new york](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/family-with-teens-visit-zoo-in-new-york.jpg)

NYC has many excellent zoos for you and your teenager to explore. There’s one in almost every borough and they can provide an entire day’s worth of entertainment.

**[Bronx Zoo](https://bronxzoo.com):** the Bronx Zoo is not only the largest zoo in New York, it is also one of the largest in the entire world! Experience their incredible exhibits such as the Congo Gorilla Forest, Tiger Mountain, and the Wild Asia Monorail.

[**Prospect Park Zoo**](https://prospectparkzoo.com): This is one of the smaller zoos on this list so I’d recommend combining this trip with exploring Prospect Park, Botanical Gardens, and the Brooklyn Museum, while you’re already in the area. 

[**Central Park Zoo**](https://centralparkzoo.com): If you’re visiting Central Park it is definitely worthwhile to stop at the zoo! Check out the fabulous Sea Lion exhibit and the adorable penguins, as well as big mammals like snow leopards and grizzly bears

[**Queens Zoo**](https://queenszoo.com/things-to-do): Queens Zoo is a great pick if you’re already in that borough. They have a petting zoo and a historic aviary that guests rave about!

## 17\. Walk the High Line and Eat at Chelsea Market

![mom and daughter walking highline in nyc](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![mom and daughter walking highline in nyc](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/foodie-approved-nyc-tours-highline.jpg)

[The High Line](https://www.thehighline.org) is a public park created on top of an old railway that takes you around Chelsea. Beautiful plants line the walkways but the true star is the massive art pieces on display throughout your walk. These pieces are constantly changing and daring new artists are being commissioned to put their work up in this one of a kind venue.

When you reach the end of the High Line you will land at [Chelsea Market](https://www.chelseamarket.com). This is an incredible food hall where some of the most popular restaurants in the city have storefronts. There is also an [Artists and Fleas](https://www.artistsandfleas.com/chelsea/) section where you can purchase handmade jewelry, pottery, vintage or screen-printed clothing, records and more. In my opinion, the perfect combo is getting two adobada tacos from Los Tacos No. 1 (located in the food hall), a cup of chocolate gelato from L’Arte Del Gelato, and spending an hour perusing the “Artists and Fleas” with a your teen!

## 18\. Shop ‘Til You Drop

![two teens girls shopping in soho nyc](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20963%20642'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![two teens girls shopping in soho nyc](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/two-teens-girls-shopping-in-soho-nyc.jpg)

All the best brands have a storefront in NYC. Whether you’re shopping for designer labels or the best thrift and vintage shops you and your teen can find what you’re looking for in New York.

**[Fifth Avenue](https://fifthavenue.nyc):** Located between 49th and 60th in Midtown, this is the longest stretch of luxury shops in the city. Even if you don’t have the funds to shop in any of the stores on the street, it’s worth visiting it to view the incredibly intricate window displays. You see shops like Bergdorf Goodman, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, and other such designer brands here.

[**Soho**](https://www.nyctourism.com/itineraries/essential-soho-shopping-guide/): this neighborhood is where art and luxury cross over. You can visit high-end independent galleries, or shop designer brands as you walk around the shopping district in Soho. Walk the strip of Broadway between Houston and Canal for the best shopping!

**Williamsburg:** Williamsburg is up-and-coming as a shopping destination. They have amazing vintage stores, artisan boutiques, and independent artists selling their wares. Try Mother of Junk for second-hand furniture, [Awoke Vintage](https://www.awokevintage.com) for clothes, [Spoonbill & Sugartown](https://spoonbillbooks.com) for books, and [Haricot Verts Dreamworld](https://www.haricotvert.shop/) for jewelry.

**[Hudson Yards](https://www.hudsonyardsnewyork.com):** The Shops at Hudson Yards is a massive building housing many luxury brands and delicious restaurants. You can find designer brands like Fendi, Cartier, and Bvlgari here. And if you have time to sit down and eat a good meal, [BONDST](https://bondstrestaurant.com) or [Estiatorio Milos](https://www.estiatoriomilos.com/location/nyhudsonyards/) are two fabulous options.

## 19\. Enjoy an Escape Room Experience

![escape room neon sign](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![escape room neon sign](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/go-to-escape-room-for-birthday-in-SF.jpg)

A creative way to keep your teenager entertained is to take them to an escape room. Escape rooms are immersive puzzle solving games that require teamwork and creativity. They’re very popular with young people right now, but truly provide a fun experience for those of all ages.

**[Escape the Room NYC](https://escapetheroom.com):** if this is you and your teenagers first escape room experience, this is a great pick. You can choose from nine different rooms, each with a different theme. The mechanisms of the puzzles are pretty basic and should be accessible to all. Also, the prices are very reasonable. This is a great starter escape room.

[**Komnata**](https://komnataquest.com): This escape room brands itself as an adventure that puts its players into the role of the main characters. As you solve the puzzle, you will discover the story you are inside of. Komnata rooms are great for teens who like role-playing or acting.

[**MyssTic**](https://www.myssticrooms.com): This is the most theatrical escape room on our list. MyssTic combines the mechanics and puzzle solving elements of an escape room with a theatrical performance to immerse the players as much as possible. They offer three distinct rooms you can play through known as “Montauk Project,” “Ghost Light,” and “The Bird.”

## 20\. Catch a Movie

If your teen is a film buff they’ve come to the right place. New York offers elevated movie viewing experiences for true Cine files. You can skip the AMC or Regal Cinemas on this trip and try these cool indie theaters instead.

**Nighthawk Prospect Park/Williamsburg:** This theater plays a mix of new releases and old movies, with the best part being that food and drink can be brought right to your seat at any point in the viewing experience. Their menu goes above and beyond your standard popcorn and candy, and they’re always adding new themed food and drink choices, depending on what they’re playing that week.

**IFC Center:** The IFC Center is consistently playing the coolest indie films. They often get really amazing guests like directors and actors to come in and speak after screenings. Be sure to check out the roster when you’re in town if your teenager is an indie film fan.

**The Angelika Film Center:** The Angelika is a sophisticated art house movie theater, where you can eat gourmet snacks and enjoy foreign and indie films. This is a very elegant and historical fixture in New York City, and is definitely worth a visit!

## Final Thoughts

The most important questions to ask yourself when crafting an itinerary for your New York trip with a teenager are: What attractions will hold their attention? Do our plans include sensory experiences, like tasting good food, or interacting with games and activities? Can we make seeing the sights more active, by biking or walking around them? Your teen is sure to be dazzled by their time in NYC if you can check off these questions when planning your vacation.
