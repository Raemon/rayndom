Summary

Healthy team building activities provide inclusive opportunities for those participating in Dry January. This post includes activity ideas, Dry January tips for work, and the benefits of Dry January at work.

Updated on January 14, 2025

Ringing in New Year offers a fresh start— a chance to make this year better than the last and reset for new challenges. It’s also a great time for some healthy [team building events](https://avitalexperiences.com/corporate-team-building/) to bring your group together to kickoff the year. Since many of your team members might be participating in [Dry January](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_January) or have other health-conscious resolutions, you’ll want to plan some healthy team building that can bring the whole team together. While we love a [virtual happy hour](https://avitalexperiences.com/experiences/virtual-happy-hour-with-cocktail-kit/), these activities will have you and your team feeling focused, mindful, and build community.

### 1\. Taste Waters Like Fine Wine

[Start Your Booking](https://avitalexperiences.com/booking/)

Gotta stay hydrated! Water tasting is a healthy team building idea that checks off two boxes: drinking more water and appealing to those participating in Dry January. Water might not seem like the obvious choice for a tasting event, but trust us when we say the world of water is much more nuanced than you think. A Certified Water Sommelier (yes, that’s a real job) will walk you and your team through a professional tasting, with glass bottled waters from around the world. It’s a unique team building activity we guarantee your team hasn’t done before!

### 2\. Host A Fun Run

A team race is an exciting, healthy team-building activity to raise awareness for a charitable cause, promote fitness, or bond while running together. The best part is that it can be organized at any location, whether it’s a local park, trail, or even your office parking lot. You can set the race day for the end of the month to give your team something to train for, or hold one at the start and end of the month so participants can work on improving their times.

### 3\. Practice Group Meditation

Mindfulness in the workplace has many benefits from reducing stress and anxiety to increasing creativity. A group meditation practice is a great way to help your team relieve a little stress and remind them to take a moment out of the day for themselves to reconnect with their surroundings. We recommend launching a meditation program and practicing on a weekly basis to really see the benefits. You can either play a [pre-recorded mediation for work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0bvgiAnTSw) audio or [hire a mediation expert](https://hirespace.com/c/suppliers/event-experiences/mindfulness-workshop).

### 5\. Take A Plant-Based Cooking Class

Eating healthier or more sustainably is sure to be a resolution for many. And after a busy holiday season, we welcome a delicious plant-based meal! Whether the goal is to eat more plant-based on regular basis or try something new, learning how to make a plant-based meal from a professional will definitely improve cooking skills and take the fear out of preparing those types of meals. [Cozymeal offers cooking classes for teams](https://www.cozymeal.com/) both in-person and online.

### 6\. Start A Book Club

If #BookTok has taught us anything, it’s that reading brings people together. Bonding over a book leads to the exchange of ideas, respectful discussion, and the chance to explore new themes through literature. While your book club can focus on books related to work or self-improvement, there’s also the opportunity to escape from the work day by diving into some fiction. Reading is an enriching, healthy team building activity perfect for the New Year.

### 7\. Plan A Self-Care Day

Encourage your team to participate in a self-care activity that makes them happy and/or is related to their New Year’s goals. This could range from hitting the gym, doing a hobby they enjoy or learning a new one, taking a walk, etc. Have them share what they did the following week. Self-care days don’t need to be much more than doing what makes you happy, as long as you actually set time aside to do it! Letting your team members know that there’s room for self-care at the workplace shows that you value their well-being.

### 8\. **Team Wellness Challenge**

Set up a month-long wellness challenge that includes goals like staying hydrated, practicing mindfulness, or getting 10,000 steps daily. Teams can log their progress, share tips, and celebrate wins together. This activity fosters camaraderie and supports healthier habits in and out of the workplace.

## Dry January Drinks 

Dry January is a great time to explore creative alcohol-free beverages. Here are some fun drink ideas for team building or office events:

![medium](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20300%20200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![medium](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Pouring-Vichy-Catalan-into-water-glass-during-virtual-water-tasting-300x200.jpg)

##### **Taste Water Like Wine**

Compare different types of water, such as sparkling, mineral, and flavored, to see how unique water can taste.

![medium](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20300%20200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![medium](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/pouring-pink-cocktail-into-glass-300x200.jpg)

##### **Make a Mocktail of Your Favorite Cocktail**

Transform classic cocktails into mocktails by replacing the spirit with still or sparkling water. For example, use soda water in place of gin in a mock G&T.

![medium](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20300%20200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![medium](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/beer-tasting-virtual-happy-hour-cocktail-kits-300x200.png)
