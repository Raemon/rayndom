    Avital is just honestly the best! I haven't physically been on a tour yet, though I can't wait until I get to! I have booked food tours in both SF and NYC for clients. The groups have absolutely loved their experiences with both Nikki & Yasmin! Most have echoed it's been their favorite part of visiting each city. This company is so professional, helpful, easy going, and communicative. Highly recommend!

    We had a group of 16 and Cherie was an absolute delight. The food and walk around SF's Mission was exciting, tasty, and most of all fun. We're already thinking of when to book our next tour with Avital and can't wait to see what's in store for SF's North Beach excursion. Thanks so much Avital and Cherie! We had a great time!!

## What are DC Private Dining Rooms?

Private dining rooms in Washington DC are designated separate spaces within restaurants that provide privacy and an exclusive atmosphere for guests. These rooms are distinct from the main dining area and are ideal for hosting various events such as business meetings, VIP client dinners, holiday parties, birthday or anniversary celebrations, baby showers, rehearsal dinners, and graduations. 

They offer an elevated dining experience with tailored menus and attentive service, making them perfect for both intimate gatherings and larger private events in the vibrant dining scene of Washington DC.

## How to Book a Private Dining Room in DC

Whether you’re planning an intimate birthday party, a corporate dinner, or a lively standing reception, following a few simple steps will help you secure the ideal space for your next occasion.

Start by identifying your needs for the private event. Consider the number of guests, your budget, and the type of ambiance you want—do you envision a cozy, intimate space for a family gathering, or a spacious private dining room for a larger dinner party?

Next, research restaurants in DC that offer private dining rooms. Look for venues located near the National Mall, along the waterfront, or in your favorite neighborhood. Many restaurants in the city feature a variety of private dining spaces, from elegant dining rooms to vibrant bars and patios, so you can find the perfect spot to accommodate your group and set the right tone for your celebration.

Once you’ve narrowed down your options, reach out to the restaurants directly to check availability and get details on pricing. Be sure to ask about food and beverage minimums, menu options, and any special requirements for private events. If you’re planning presentations or need audio-visual equipment, confirm that the private dining space can accommodate those needs. Some venues even offer flexible setups for seated brunches, dinner parties, or standing receptions, so don’t hesitate to ask about different configurations.

Before making your final decision, request a tour of the private dining room or space. This gives you a chance to see the seating arrangements, check the ambiance, and make sure the room feels right for your event. Pay attention to details like lighting, decor, and whether the space feels intimate or spacious enough for your guests.

Finally, review the contract and cancellation policies carefully before booking. Understanding the terms will help you avoid surprises and ensure a smooth, stress-free experience.
