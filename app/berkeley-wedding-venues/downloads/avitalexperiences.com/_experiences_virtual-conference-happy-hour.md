## What Is a Virtual Happy Hour?

A virtual happy hour is an online virtual event for groups and teams where they make and drink different cocktails. These events are typically held on video platforms like Zoom or Google Meet and connect people from all over the world. Guests learn cool mixology techniques from an expert bartender, plus discover unique cocktail recipes and flavors. Virtual happy hours are a great way to connect remote or hybrid teams for [virtual team building](https://avitalexperiences.com/7-best-team-building-activities-for-globally-distributed-teams-fall-2021/), or even for [virtual client entertainment](https://avitalexperiences.com/what-weve-learned-about-engaging-clients-virtually/). 

FAQ 

What’s in the cocktail kit? 

Ingredients delivery upgrades include all the consumable items required to make your cocktail (enough for 2!) such as specialty syrups or bitters, whole fresh citrus fruit, garnish, and YES the alcohol, too! *Except where restricted by law.

What if I don’t have a cocktail shaker or tools? 

No problem! We’ll send you a prep sheet in advance that notes common substitute tools. A jar with lid is a great substitute shaker, measuring spoons will sub for a jigger, etc. You can also upgrade to include a professional Boston style cocktail shaker with your order.

When do you need our addresses? 

Addresses must be submitted at least 10 business days in advance to ensure pre-event delivery of your ingredients. Or add rush shipping to reduce to 7 business days in advance (+$20 per delivery).

What if I have some international participants? 

We provide international shipping to the UK and Canada! Depending on the region, address deadlines, cocktail options, and rates will vary. And guests from other parts of the world can join BYO-style.

What if I have guests who don’t drink alcohol? 

Choose one of our “Mocktail Friendly” cocktail options for an inclusive experience. You mixologist will note any recipe variations required, and all materials for a delicious mocktail version are included in every delivery. Mark “non-alcoholic” on the guest list for anyone who would also like the alcohol removed from their box.

Will I be notified about tracking for ingredient delivery? 

Yes! We send tracking information/numbers as soon as we receive them from our shipping carriers. Please contact [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) with any questions or concerns you may have about tracking for your event, and our team will be happy to help!

What if I don’t know my total number of guests? 

That’s okay! Book your event with a deposit for your minimum attendance estimate. Final count due 10 business days prior to event (with your mailing addresses.) Continue to add “BYO” guests at any time.

Is there time to share our company’s content? 

Yes! Standard run time is 45-60 minutes, with flexibility for up to 10 minutes of your own content. If you need additional time, you can add hosted emcee time at $25 per 15 minutes. Alternatively, you may host on your own platform account (we join for 1 hour before/after your content, no extra staff time charges.)

What if I need a shorter event? 

Our Mixology experience is carefully curated to be a cohesive, energetic experience for your guests and works best when you stick to our well-rehearsed timing. We do our best to accommodate requests for condensed experiences, but want to set your expectations and encourage you to let us do what we do best, in 45-60 minutes.

Can we use our own platform? 

Yes! You are welcome to host on your own account/platform instead of our Avital Zoom if you wish. Our staff is fluent on Google Meet, Zoom, WebEx, and Teams, and must be granted access to Screen Share, Chat, and Mute capabilities. For all other platforms, please inquire about capability and recommendations. Platforms with two-way/group video capabilities are best for this interactive experience.

Can we schedule a rehearsal call? 

All event packages include 15 minutes extra prior to your event start time for any sound checks or tech checks you may need with our Emcee. Our Virtual Conference Happy Hour packages also include a separate rehearsal run-through.
