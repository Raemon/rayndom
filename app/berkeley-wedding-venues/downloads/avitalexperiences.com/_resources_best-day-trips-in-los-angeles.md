#  4 Best Day Trips in Los Angeles 

February 2, 2017 

Having a “day trip” in the city you live might seem strange, but even for those who live in LA, venturing across the city doesn’t happen very often (read: traffic) so there are parts of LA that even residents want to visit. Here are four of the best day trips in Los Angeles. These adventures take up the whole day, so you can justify spending a bit of time in traffic to get there.

# [![Some of The Best Day Trips in Los Angeles are Santa Monica and Venice](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/12/Sunset-on-Venice-Beach-one-Of-The-Best-Day-Trips-in-Los-Angeles.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/12/Sunset-on-Venice-Beach-one-Of-The-Best-Day-Trips-in-Los-Angeles.jpg)

## Venice and Santa Monica

Those who don’t live on the west side of the city may forget how close they are to the beach. Head to Venice Beach and Santa Monica for one of the best day trips in Los Angeles. Spend a few hours laying on the sand and swimming in the ocean and the traffic on the 10 will seem forever away. Hungry? Venice has some of the best eats in town like our favorites [Gjelina](http://www.gjelina.com/), [The Anchor](http://theanchorvenice.squarespace.com/) and [Blue Star Donuts](http://www.bluestardonuts.com/) which are all walkable along great shopping streets Main Street or Abbot Kinney. Walk down the Venice Boardwalk toward Santa Monica. Sure, the [Santa Monica Pier](http://santamonicapier.org/) might be a little touristy, but a sunset ride around the Ferris wheel is a perfect end to the day.

## **[![The Best Day Trips in Los Angeles include a stop on Grand Avenue at the Disney Concert Hall ](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20640%20364'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![The Best Day Trips in Los Angeles include a stop on Grand Avenue at the Disney Concert Hall ](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/12/Disney-Concert-Hall-on-Grand-Avenue-a-stop-on-one-Of-The-Best-Day-Trips-in-Los-Angeles.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/12/Disney-Concert-Hall-on-Grand-Avenue-a-stop-on-one-Of-The-Best-Day-Trips-in-Los-Angeles.jpg)**Grand Avenue

A day trip recommendation on a single street seems odd, but there is so much do on this street that you really can make a day of it. Hit contemporary art museums like [The Broad](http://www.thebroad.org/) and the [Museum of Contemporary Art ](http://www.moca.org/). If you still have energy after exploring two museums, right next door to both is the [Walt Disney Concert Hall](http://www.laphil.com/), home of the LA Philharmonic. Find a full season schedule [here](http://www.laphil.com/tickets/calendar-fullseason) so you can catch a show, or just go on a [tour](http://www.laphil.com/visit/tours). For lunch or dinner head to [Grand Central Market](http://www.grandcentralmarket.com/), just a few blocks away and [use our self guided tour](http://avitaltours.com/los-angeles/Grand-Central-Market-Food-Tour) to find local favorites like Egg Slut and G&B Coffee.

[![The Best Day Trips in Los Angeles include dumplings](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20640%20428'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![The Best Day Trips in Los Angeles include dumplings](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/12/Dumplings-in-San-Gabriel-Valley-is-a-stop-on-one-of-the-Best-Day-Trips-in-Los-Angeles.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/12/Dumplings-in-San-Gabriel-Valley-is-a-stop-on-one-of-the-Best-Day-Trips-in-Los-Angeles.jpg)

## San Gabriel Valley

LA residents may complain about traveling across the city, but they will often do it for a good meal. LA’s neighborhoods each come with their own specialty, and San Gabriel is known for its authentic Chinese food, which is worth the trek. The food in this part of town is praised often by LA Times food critic [Jonathon Gold.](http://www.latimes.com/food/dailydish/la-dd-tasty-chinese-restaurants-20151207-story.html) Lucky Peach even came up with a [dumpling crawl](http://luckypeach.com/a-dumpling-crawl-of-las-san-gabriel-valley/) that could take up the majority of the day…and spend the other part digesting. Plan your day trip to coincide with the weekend of [Monterey Park’s Lunar New Year](http://www.montereypark.ca.gov/669/Lunar-New-Year-Festival) Festival, one of the biggest festivals of the year. Of course, there’s more to do here than eat. [Take a hike](http://www.hikespeak.com/los-angeles/san-gabriel-mountains/) in the San Gabriel Mountains and you’ll even see some waterfalls. Or go shopping at the [Rose Bowl Flea Market. ](http://www.rosebowlstadium.com/events/flea-market) End your day with a visit to the drive in movies at the [Vineland Drive In Theater.](http://vinelanddriveintheater.com/)

[![Silver Lake's Vista Theater makes a great stop on The Best Day Trips in Los Angeles ](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20765'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Silver Lake's Vista Theater makes a great stop on The Best Day Trips in Los Angeles ](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/12/Include-a-stop-at-Silver-Lakes-Vista-Theater-as-part-of-The-Best-Day-Trips-in-Los-Angeles-.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/12/Include-a-stop-at-Silver-Lakes-Vista-Theater-as-part-of-The-Best-Day-Trips-in-Los-Angeles-.jpg)

## Silver Lake

**** This hip neighborhood is the walkable area that many non-native residents crave. You can spend a day on an urban adventure here. Take a walk around the Silver Lake Reservoir trail and check out the neighborhood dogs at the two dog parks. Either picnic on the park or head to one of the local restaurants Silver Lake is known for. There are no shortage of eats, from Thai favorite [Night and Market Song](http://www.nightmarketla.com/) to [Squirl](http://sqirlla.com/), where a brunch-time line is inevitable. Don’t go home yet! After hours, hang at one of many bars and music venues. [Los Globos](http://www.clublosglobos.com/) hosts events like storytelling night The Moth, Madonna dance parties, and local bands. Or, head to a movie at the [Vista Theatre](http://www.vintagecinemas.com/vista/) where the manager dresses as a movie character for each opening night. #EmbraceQuirky? Silver Lake has you covered.
