They say New York is the city that never sleeps. They also call it the Big Apple. We like to think it’s the “big apple that never sleeps!” That has a ring to it doesn’t it? Seriously though, one of the things New York is most well known for is their food scene. From high end Michelin starred restaurants to divey hole in the wall pizza slice joints – New York has something to offer everybody when it comes to food. We’ve curated this list of best [NYC walking food tours](https://avitalexperiences.com/new-york-city/walking-food-tours/) to showcase what this city, and its restaurants, have to offer. 

## **What is an NYC Walking Food Tour?**

First things first, what is a NYC walking food tour? An NYC walking food tour, clearly, takes place within New York City. A walking[ food tour](https://avitalexperiences.com/food-tours/) is a tour that uses walking as the form of transport (you see a city the best this way!). And, you guessed it, the tour centers around the food in the particular location you are walking in. This can include going to restaurants, bakeries, bars, kitchens, food trucks, and more. The tour guide or company you sign up with will determine the food, the setting, and the vibe.

Check out our hand selected list of NYC walking food tours below – we’re pretty sure you’re going to find something you’re excited about.

## **1\. Experience Punk and Multicultural Roots in this East Village Food Tour**
