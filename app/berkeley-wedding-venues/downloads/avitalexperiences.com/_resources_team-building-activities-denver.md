### Cherry Creek Trail

If your team is athletic you should take them on the incredible 8 mile [Cherry Creek Trail](https://parkerrec.com/315/Cherry-Creek-Regional-Trail) hike. You can walk or bike this scenic trail together and take in the beauty of Denver’s native vegetation. Spending time in nature is proven to clear peoples minds which will lead to a greater sense of tranquility and focus when you’re back in the office!

![Friends Golfing at Willis Case Golf Course in Denver](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20660'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Friends Golfing at Willis Case Golf Course in Denver](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/O9.-@denvergolf5280.PNG-1024x660.jpg)@denvergolf5280

### Golfing

A day at a [Willis Case Golf Course](https://www.cityofdenvergolf.com) is certain to be appreciated by any seasoned players on your team. They have eight different courses including one in the mountains where your team can spend the day enjoying the well-maintained course, hitting some balls, and getting to know each other better.

![Coworkers pose on a Stay Boots scavenger hunt in Denver](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20768'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Coworkers pose on a Stay Boots scavenger hunt in Denver](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/O4.-https_www.strayboots.com_-1024x768.jpg)strayboots.com

It’s a unique team building activity that can be hosted in multiple fun neighborhoods in the city, and the experience is reportedly rife with great photo ops and constant laughter.

![Friends cheers on the Denver Micro Brew Tour](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20683'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Friends cheers on the Denver Micro Brew Tour](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/O5.-https_www.denvermicrobrewtour.com_rino-beer-and-graffiti-tour_-1024x683.webp)denvermicrobrewtour.com

### Beer and Graffiti Tour

When you think about a city known for its beer and graffiti Denver might not be the first city that comes to mind. This [RiNo Beer and Graffiti Tour](https://www.denvermicrobrewtour.com/rino-beer-and-graffiti-tour/) will change your opinion, where you’ll find out that there are 20 breweries in a 1 mile radius in the area! On this tour, you’ll have plenty of time to bond with your team between sips of craft beer and stories about the incredible graffiti murals adorning the buildings of this city.

![A sign points to different trails on Echo Mountain](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20952%201024'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![A sign points to different trails on Echo Mountain](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/O6.-@echomtnco.PNG-952x1024.jpg)@echomtnco

### Skiing

It would feel wrong to create a team-building activities list that doesn’t utilize one of Colorado’s best natural resources, so in our last slot we recommend taking your team skiing at [Echo Mountain](https://echomtn.com)! It may not be in Denver proper but it is less than an hour away making it an awesome day trip destination. This activity is ideal for teams where folks have ski experience and their own gear, but many beginners also describe having a great time on the mountain, and there is limited gear for rent once you get there.
