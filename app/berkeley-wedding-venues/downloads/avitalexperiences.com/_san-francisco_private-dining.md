Private Dining FAQs 

What is San Francisco private dining? 

[Private dining](https://avitalexperiences.com/private-dining/) refers to reserving a designated area within a restaurant or venue for a private event, such as a birthday, corporate gathering, or celebration.

San Francisco private dining experiences are available throughout the city, including North Beach, Mission, FiDi, and beyond.

How much does a private dining room cost in San Francisco? 

The cost of a private dining room in San Francisco can range widely, typically from $500 to $5,000 or more, depending on the venue, location, time of day, and group size. Some venues may charge a room fee, while others may include food and beverage minimums. It’s best to discuss your budget and needs with the restaurant to get an accurate quote.
