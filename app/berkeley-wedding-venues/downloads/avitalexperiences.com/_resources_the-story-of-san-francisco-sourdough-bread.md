Updated October 27, 2025 

Have you ever wondered what makes San Francisco sourdough special? Or what is the history of sourdough bread? Or where are the [best restaurants in San Francisco](https://avitalexperiences.com/resources/best-restaurants-in-san-francisco/) to eat it? If you’ve ever pondered even one of these questions you’ve stumbled onto the perfect post. Today we’re answering all these queries and more, while we get to the heart of San Francisco-style sourdough bread and what makes it so special.

## San Francisco Sourdough Bread Highlights

  * 🍞 Sourdough is fermented by a live and active sourdough starter, rather than commercial yeast
  * 🦠 Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis bacteria give San Francisco sourdough a unique flavor and texture 
  * 🇪🇬 Sourdough’s origins go all the way back to ancient Egypt, around 1500 BC
  * 💰 Basque immigrants and French bakers are credited with bringing sourdough to SF during the 1840s Gold Rush
  * 🥖 The oldest sourdough bakery in SF is the Boudin Bakery, established in 1849

## What is Sourdough Bread?

Sourdough bread is a type of bread that is made through a process where the dough is fermented by a live and active sourdough starter, rather than commercial yeast. Sourdough bread is tangy, chewy, and easily digestible because of its long fermentation process.

![loaf of san francisco sourdough bread](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20866'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![loaf of san francisco sourdough bread](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/San-Francisco-Sourdough-Bread-2.jpg)

## What is Different About San Francisco Sourdough Bread?

If you’ve ever wondered exactly what is San Francisco style sourdough is and what differentiates it from other sourdoughs the short answer is that it comes down to the unique climate of the city it is made in and the wild yeast and bacteria native to SF. During fermentation the local lactobacilli (bacteria that produces lactic acid during the bread’s fermentation process) like Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis (no really, that’s what it’s called) give the bread its unique tangy flavor.

## History of Sourdough Bread in San Francisco 

In the early years of mining mayhem, San Franciscan bakers were perplexed. After biting into their newly baked bread, recipes they had been making in the France had turned sour. Yet, somehow they realized that they liked how the bread tasted – they struck culinary gold of sorts. Thus the name of the bread became sour dough.

Bread was so important to the miners that on cold nights they would cuddle with their yeast starter to keep it warm – so it wouldn’t die. These intelligent miners became known as “sourdoughs”.

Initially it was thought that San Francisco was the only place where San Francisco Sourdough Bread could be made because our foggy climate cultivated this specific type of yeast. Local bakers, including [Boudin](https://www.boudinbakery.com/) founded in 1849, swore that no one could reproduce it outside a 50-mile radius of the city – thus adding to its allure.

Now we know that is not true – since some scientists were able to identify the particular strain of bacteria responsible for the San Francisco bread’s sour flavor. It has now been discovered all over the world, but the good news is that at least we still lay claim to the name of the bacteria- L. sanfranciscensis.

San Francisco is widely regarded as the mecca of sour-style bread and in the 1980s the San Francisco artisan bread movement reinvigorated our bread-making image with an emphasis on great technique. The likes of Acme bread (located at the Ferry Building) and Semmifreddi came on the scene. And more recently in the past 10 years artisan baking has exploded in the trendy San Francisco culinary scene with the likes of [Tartine Bakery](http://www.tartinebakery.com/), [Josey Baker at The Mill](https://joseybakerbread.wordpress.com/the-mill-2/) and [Della Fattoria](http://www.dellafattoria.com/). San Francisco Sourdough Bread is here to stay!

## Where Did Sourdough Bread Originate?

If you’re thinking, “was sourdough bread invented in San Francisco?”, the short answer is no. Although it was popularized in the States during the San Francisco Gold Rush, sourdough bread’s origins go all the way back to ancient Egypt, around 1500 BC.

## Who Invented Sourdough Bread?

There is no one person credited with inventing sourdough bread. The history of sourdough bread can only be traced back as far as the Egyptians but it’s possible there were civilizations before them who made it, and we just haven’t unearthed that evidence yet. 

## What is the Oldest Sourdough Bakery in San Francisco?

The oldest sourdough bakery in SF is the [Boudin Bakery](https://boudinbakery.com). It was created in 1849 by French Immigrant Isidore Boudin during the Gold Rush and remains open to this day. They say that the mother dough they use to make their sourdough bread is cultivated from a starter that once belonged to a gold miner in the 1800s!

## Is Trader Joe’s San Francisco Style Sourdough Bread Real Sourdough?

Yes! It is made with sourdough starter, and not commercial yeast, making it real sourdough.

## Where Can I Buy Sourdough Starter in San Francisco?

Most bakeries will give away their sourdough starter for free so long as you buy something and bring your own vessel. Here are a few places you can grab some starter to get started on your own sourdough journey.
