Virtual Happy Hour With Ingredients Delivered**

### **Get everything you need minus the spirit in one kit**

Everything you need for classic cocktails, minus the spirit! [This kit](https://wandpdesign.com/products/the-old-fashioned-virtual-happy-hour-cocktail-kit?variant=31785935896641) is nice and compact so it’s perfect for a virtual happy hour at your desk. There’s kits for an Old Fashioned, margaritas, and more. And since there’s no spirits included, everyone can get their favorite brands. Go from work to happy hour with ease.

### **Taste California through the world of white wine**

Monochrome specializes in a [virtual tasting kit](https://monochromewines.com/virtual-tasting-kit/) that brings the best of their white wines to your home. This Californian winemaker will make you rethink what you know about white wine— and that it’s not as one dimensional as you think. You can also set up a complimentary virtual tasting session for a full experience.

### **Order customized cocktail boxes from The Bubble Tap**

For a custom look that will impress your team or clients, order your cocktail kits from The Bubble Tap. You can choose from a wooden gift box or a custom printed box with your branding. The Bubble Tap started as pink trailer that served bubbly on on draft, so they know good branding. Set up your [virtual mixology session](https://taptrailerco.com/virtual-mixology-boxes/) for a fun time that gets started with your custom branded kit.

### **Learn shaken & stirred cocktails in one class**

Get the best of both worlds with a [Mixology Medley](https://avitaltours.com/virtual-happy-hour/) kit. You’ll learn both a shaken and stirred cocktail, as well as an understanding of the cocktail family tree that will take your skills to new levels. Plus, the kit includes all the ingredients and the class is taught by an award-winning mixologist. “Shaken or stirred” will take on a whole new meaning for you after this class!

### **Make it easy with bottled cocktails**

If you’re looking a for a virtual happy hour that requires no set-up, pre-bottled cocktails are a really great option. You can let your guests choose the drink they want and hang out, or you can plan a [virtual happy hour](https://www.straightawaycocktails.com/virtual-happy-hours) with Straightaway, a company that promises “astonishing cocktails” straight from the bottle. They’ll teach you about the history of cocktails as you sip away on a fresh drink.

### Sip on some tasty non-alcoholic cocktails

Non-alcoholic cocktails and spirits are on the rise, appealing to both drinkers and non-drinkers. For an inclusive virtual happy hour, try joining the [Curious Cocktail Club](https://curiouselixirs.com/collections/cocktails/products/curious-cocktail-club-monthly-variety-pack). They’ll sip a monthly variety pack of non-alcoholic drinks as part of a subscription service. This means the plans are already made, and no one needs to feel left out if they don’t drink or if they don’t feel like drinking that day.

### Go classic with a beer flight

Don’t feel like making cocktails but still want a virtual happy hour kit? Go for a beer flight! It’s simple and crowd-pleasing. A v[irtual beer tasting](https://www.withconfetti.com/product/virtual-beer-tasting?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=DSA&utm_adgroup=Virtual_beer_tasting&utm_term=&utm_content=) has all the appeal of a virtual cocktail class and you’ll learn all about beer— how to identify tasting notes and smells, assessing the mouthfeel, and what the look means. You’ll appreciate beer in a whole new way.

## [![family dancing during virtual happy hour event](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![family dancing during virtual happy hour event](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/vitual-happy-hour-themes-header.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/vitual-happy-hour-themes-header.jpg)  
Virtual Happy Hour Themes

### **Celebrate the national day**

Holidays are easy to turn to for themes, but we’re not just talking about Christmas or Halloween. You’ve likely heard someone mention it being “National Chocolate Chip Cookie Day” or even “National Frozen Food Day” in passing. Well, [these national days](https://nationaldaycalendar.com/what-day-is-it/) are great inspirations for virtual happy hour ideas. Choose a day that sounds most appealing, and use that as a guideline for your theme. Here are a couple examples:

  * **National Pancake Day (Feb 16):** For a cozy, casual Friday. Everyone makes a stack of flapjacks with a cinnamon maple whiskey sour on the side. 
  * **National Olive Day (June 1):** Everyone buys their favorite olives and makes martinis!
  * **National Beer Lovers Day (Sept 7):** Well, this one is pretty self-explanatory. Prost!



### **Turn happy hour into a virtual poetry reading**

One of our favorite virtual happy hour ideas for a classy evening is adding some poetry into the mix. A poet [creates live poetry on-demand](https://www.thevendry.co/services/all/virtual-events-live-poetry?t=13&st=26), and then the poems get mailed to your door. Add some wine and cheese, and you’ve got yourself a special evening planned. 

### **Explore the high seas as pirates**

[Talk Like A Pirate Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Talk_Like_a_Pirate_Day) is the ultimate national day, in our not so unbiased opinion. A pirate-themed virtual happy hour is a lot of fun. Have everyone dress up as pirates, find their perfect ship background, and make sure lots of rum is handy. Of course, a competition for the best pirate accent is mandatory. Ahoy, mateys! 

### **Throw an improv night**

If you’ve got some natural comedians in your group, try hosting an improv night. But you don’t need to be Will Ferrel to have a good time during improv. The inherent silliness of the games and quick-thinking on your feet is sure to have guests laughing. This is a great option if you want to get the whole family involved too! Just make it a mocktail, keep the prompts PG, and you’ve got yourself a wholesome night of fun. 

### **Virtual Karaoke Night**

While nothing will beat belting Whitney Houston in person, a virtual karaoke night is not impossible, and just as fun. [V](https://voiceboxkaraoke.com/virtual-karaoke/)irtual Voicebox helps you book an online room, and provides all the karaoke music. All you need are headphones with a built-in microphone…and maybe some earplugs for the neighbors. 

### **Make it an 80s Power Hour**

It will be totally rad to throw an 80s-themed virtual happy hour. Grab an 80s playlist and make sure to include everyone’s favorites and break out the hair spray for some big hair. Ask everyone to dress up as 80s icons or in their best 80s fashion and party all night long. 

### **Belt it out with Divas**

Everything is glamorous with legendary divas like Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston, and Celine Dion. For your diva-themed virtual happy hour, tell everyone to get glam and get read to belt. Cocktails must be fabulous, feather boas and sequins are non-negotiable, and a spotlight (or ring light) is necessary. 

### Show and Tell Night

This doesn’t have to be your typical elementary school-style show and tell— for this virtual happy hour theme, you can choose to ask each person to share about a unique hobby or skill, something from their culture, cherished pictures from their younger days, etc. It’s a simple way to bond that doesn’t require much set up, but still manages to make people feel special.

### **Pretend you’re at “The Office”**

Nope, not the one you actually used to go to, but the beloved sitcom series. There’s plenty of “The Office” trivia games and virtual backgrounds to make this theme possible. You can even throw your own version of The Dundees. Ask everyone to dress up as their favorite character from the show, but keep an eye out — there’s a lot you can tell about someone who chooses to dress up as Dwight or Creed. 

### Celebrate the Olympics

We’re excited to celebrate the Olympics this year, and an Olympics-themed virtual happy hour is a fun way to share the spirit of the event. You can choose to host your own office Olympics with different games or just organize nights to stream the events together, have everyone choose different countries to support, dress up as Olympians, etc.

### **Go on an Italian getaway**

Viva Italia! Go on a Roman holiday ala Audrey Hepburn with pictures of Italy for the background, Italian music, and of course, some pasta and wine, or other delicious Italian delicacies. Plan a menu, pour the Chianti, and transport yourselves to Italy. 

### **Visit Harry Potter at Hogwarts**

Sorry, we had to. If you’ve ever wanted to get into Hogwarts, now’s your chance. A Harry Potter-themed happy hour is easily put together with trivia, escape rooms, or a simple movie marathon. Sort your group into houses, choose your wands, and practice your magic. It’s escapism at its finest. 

### “Greece” is the word

What could be more lively, spirited, and relaxing all at the same time? A trip to Greece. Set up a night celebrating the culture of the ancient country. Learn how to [dance the surtaki](https://www.expedia.com/things-to-do/tickets.a3035610.activity-details?endDate=2021-04-05&location=Athens%20City%20Centre%2C%20Athens%2C%20Attica%2C%20Greece&rid=6200220&startDate=2021-03-22), experience Athens through the [eyes of its infamous cats](https://www.expedia.com/things-to-do/athens-plaka-cats-of-athens-self-guided-virtual-experience.a3047465.activity-details?endDate=2021-04-05&location=Athens%20City%20Centre%2C%20Athens%2C%20Attica%2C%20Greece&rid=6200220&startDate=2021-03-22), or [play a quirky Greek trivia game](https://www.airbnb.com/experiences/1710354?currentTab=experience_tab&federatedSearchId=990b1d28-cd5a-4a25-943b-2ef465757365&searchId=ee4d9763-6fa6-4152-a082-d8775d35d61e&sectionId=03947e67-f8b3-4bdc-ac04-ced555cf5578&source=p2). Opa!

### Bring back summer camp!

Summer camp doesn’t just have to be for the kids. Host a summer camp themed virtual happy hour by making some s’mores, singing some songs, telling scary stories, and competing in games.

## [![woman making terrarium during virtual happy hour](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![woman making terrarium during virtual happy hour](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/vitual-happy-hour-activities-header.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/vitual-happy-hour-activities-header.jpg)  
Virtual Happy Hour Games & Activities

### **Try your hand at DIY**

Arts and crafts are relaxing activities for the end of the day, made even more relaxing with a delicious cocktail in hand. Whether it’s paint-n-sip or knitting something simple, [many crafts can be done virtually](https://littleredwindow.com/how-to-host-a-virtual-craft-party/). A bonus? If you mess up, no one has to know! 

### **Add some color to a spreadsheet**

While arts and crafts are relaxing, we know they aren’t for everyone. A simpler, cleaner activity? Filling in [a drawing on a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X5SB9qxtxuyJFLsSpnkLP92d7eNPQzApX0DIJGLQww4/edit#gid=518207404) with the colors of your choice. Put your guests into breakout rooms and see who is the Picasso of the group. 

### **Build a terrarium**

Terrariums and tequila anyone? Another relaxing virtual happy hour idea is building a custom terrarium together. [Send out these kits](https://www.thevendry.co/pro/469/b-floral-event-design-production-new-york-ny/service/973/terrarium-kits) beforehand, and chat while you put together something special for your desk. 

### **Virtual Family Feud**

The [beloved game show](https://littleredwindow.com/how-to-host-a-virtual-craft-party/) comes to your computer screens. With a professional host leading the game, you can compete by teams or individuals as you go head-to-head answering popular survey questions. 

### **Play with Legos**

Yes, Legos! [This team building event](https://groups.coursehorse.com/event/lego-team-building-challenge) still manages to get people to work together, even while being remote. Everyone will have to get a box of Legos to build specific things with their blocks, all part of a challenge. The kids might get jealous of this one! 

### **Write a radio show**

Move over podcasts — it’s time to head back to the days of classic, storytelling radio with this cool, [interactive workshop](https://www.teambonders.com/team-building-activities/the-spirit-of-radio-team-creative-online). Write a radio show with your team, then record and edit it for a memorable experience. 

### **Play some Jackbox games**

All you need is a [Steam account](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) and a phone to host a [virtual Jackbox night.](https://www.jackboxgames.com/) Jackbox games are quirky and engaging, and we really love how they manage to bring out the sillier side of everyone attending. 

### **Find out who’s an imposter with Among Us**

[Among Us](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/among-us/home) is one of those games that brings out the worst in people — and we’re here for it. Have everyone download the app to play beforehand, and make sure they understand the game is all about staying alive or lying your way to a win. Go off camera while you’re playing, and when a dead body is found, test your poke face to determine who the killer is. A warning: it will get ugly, but it will be so much fun. 

### **Spot out the lies in ancient Greece in this quirky history game**

For an [interactive experience with Socrates himself](https://www.airbnb.com/experiences/1710354?currentTab=experience_tab&federatedSearchId=990b1d28-cd5a-4a25-943b-2ef465757365&searchId=ee4d9763-6fa6-4152-a082-d8775d35d61e&sectionId=03947e67-f8b3-4bdc-ac04-ced555cf5578&source=p2) (sort of), play a game of true vs. false as you learn about the wacky history of ancient Greece. It promises to be lots of fun, full of new, quirky facts you didn’t learn and no school, and no boring speeches. Sounds like a good time to us! ****

### **Go back to your college days and play some beer pong**

It can be done! All you need to make sure is that your guests have enough space for a beer pong set up, cups, and ping pong balls. Split up your team into breakout rooms and go head to head in a competition to see who can come out on top (and played the most in college). You can keep people in breakout rooms as spectators as the competition heats up to find the beer pong champion. 

### **Try out a color changing vodka**

This magical [vodka](https://unicorn.vodka/vodka/) pours out of the bottle as a lovely cobalt blue color— but changes as soon as you add in another ingredient to your cocktail. Tell your virtual happy hour guests to pick up a bottle, a couple mixing options, and create a beautiful array of drinks. From pink, purple or blue, you haven’t had a drink like this before. 

### **Play a round of Scattergories**

This [Scattergories list generator ](https://swellgarfo.com/scattergories/)gives you the categories, chooses a letter, and even has a timer for each round. If you’re looking for a last-minute virtual happy hour game, this one couldn’t be more convenient. Drinks will definitely make it more interesting. 

### **Use Alexa as your game night host**

What can’t Alexa do? Turn your trusty robot friend into a game show host by [picking from different games](https://www.bustle.com/life/alexa-games-virtual-zoom-happy-hour) she can play, like Most Likely To, Spelling Bee, and a Movie Challenge. She’s a real Alex-a Trebek. 

### **Test your relationships with a game of Monopoly**

We’re not going to pretend that Monopoly can’t get a little…intense. But it is a classic and lots of fun, so it still makes this list for virtual happy hour ideas. Everyone can download the app and play together on Zoom. We like it for a mainstay game that brings teams back to their childhood. 

### **Conquer the world with Catan**

It is possible to play this classic board game online, too. This [helpful guide](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-play-settlers-of-catan-online-tips-2020-3) provides great tips for putting together a night of Catan virtually, so you don’t have to worry about the details, just the drinks. 

### Make the best cup of Vietnamese coffee

Order some coffee from the folks at [Nguyen Coffee Supply](https://nguyencoffeesupply.com/), the first specialty Vietnamese coffee company in the US, and then join them for their “Brew With Me” series on Instagram live. You’ll end up with one delicious, strong cup of coffee and a serious caffeine fix.

### Get “Lit” with this book club series

Nothing wrong with a glass of wine and a good book. The [Get Lit book club](https://thegreenespace.org/event/get-lit-with-all-of-it-patricia-lockwood/?utm_campaign=44279&utm_medium=email&utm_source=weekly-newsletter&utm_content=get-lit-%20learn&utm_term=) series brought to you by WYNC and The Greene Space brings you closer to upcoming and established authors. Read the book, stream the interview, and discuss with your friends.

### Organize a video game tournament

If you and your group have a Nintendo Switch or Playstation, you can easily organize a video game night. A round of Mario Kart or Fall Guys is enjoyable and relaxing. Even if everyone can’t join, you can hop on Zoom and chat while everyone plays.

## [![two people laughing during virtual flavor tripping](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![two people laughing during virtual flavor tripping](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/couple-flavor-tripping-during-virtual-happy-hour.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/couple-flavor-tripping-during-virtual-happy-hour.jpg)  
Ways to Amplify Your Virtual Happy Hour

### **Send a customized snack box**

What’s happy hour without great snacks? A [curated snack box](https://get.caroo.com/blog/?Platform=Blog&Campaign=CR%20WFH%20Native%20Integrations&Placement=Virtual%20Happy%20Hour) is a tasty treat that will satisfy your team or friends. They’ll be thankful they don’t have to keep going back to the kitchen for snacks! 

### **Take a class at the James Beard Foundation**

Join the best of the best in the food world at the James Beard Foundation— virtually, of course. The [monthly events](https://www.jamesbeard.org/virtual-events) range from classes on wine, how to use spring vegetables in unique ways, and much more. Virtual offerings mean you don’t need to travel to NYC to learn more about great food. 

### **Hit up Laughter on Call for a good time**

[This organization](https://laughteroncall.com/laughter-for-biz-inquiries/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=snacknation%20test) came out of the desire to help people through tough times. Laughter is the best medicine, and a great way to engage your team while lifting spirits. These comedians will bring “Happier Hours” to your group in an interactive, unique way, all virtually. 

### **Have a virtual photo booth to capture memories**

There are lots of apps, filters, and more to help you create a virtual photo booth experience. While you and your guests are enjoying your happy hour, encourage everyone to take pictures in the [virtual photo booth](https://www.thevendry.co/services/all/virtual-events-photo-booths?t=13&st=28). This is also a great addition to any themed virtual happy hours. And obviously, if it’s not posted on social media, it didn’t happen, so make sure everyone shares their fun photos! 

### **Turn your taste buds upside down with Flavor Tripping**

Think you can trick your taste buds? Or maybe you have taste buds of steel that can’t be fooled? Find out with [Flavor Tripping](https://avitaltours.com/virtual-flavor-tripping/), a quirky virtual happy hour activity that takes you and your team on a mind-bending experience. As you bond over flavor, you’ll learn how your senses truly impact your experiences with food, as well as your memory of it. 

### **Make your own cheese**

Another delicious way to change up your virtual happy hour is by attending a cheesemaking class. Cheeses like mozzarella and ricotta are easy to make at home, and the results are pretty much immediate. [Hire an expert](https://cheesegrotto.com/products/private-virtual-cheesemaking-class) to walk you through the entire process, as well as some cheesy facts. Nothing goes better with a wine happy hour than homemade cheese!
