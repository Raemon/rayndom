#  5 Restaurants with Breathtaking Views in Los Angeles 

March 23, 2017 

Los Angeles is a city with lots of opportunity for views. On a clear day, you can see snowcapped mountains in the distance. Tall downtown buildings let you view DTLA’s architectural gems. And of course, the west side of the city overlooks the Pacific Ocean and stellar sunsets. These 5 restaurants with breathtaking views in Los Angeles look over all the city has to offer.

## 1\. Nobu in Malibu

[![Nobu in Malibu is one of 5 Restaurants with Breathtaking Views in Los Angeles](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/03/6278390183_6e5b5e8f32_z.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/03/6278390183_6e5b5e8f32_z.jpg)

Your experience here will probably include viewing a celebrity, but the real view is out back. Nobu is located right off the Pacific Coast Highway (PCH), so you can eat your sushi by the ocean. The back patio is perfect for LA’s best sunny days. But if you can’t score a table outside, get a first come, first served seat at the bar with floor to ceiling windows. This PCH real estate secures Nobu on any list of restaurants with breathtaking views in Los Angeles.

## 2\. Mariasol[![5 Restaurants with Breathtaking Views in Los Angeles: Mariasol on the SantaMonica Pier](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%202048%201536'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![5 Restaurants with Breathtaking Views in Los Angeles: Mariasol on the SantaMonica Pier](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/03/7919251784_0e40989066_k.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/03/7919251784_0e40989066_k.jpg)

If you’re looking for a restaurant on the water, it’s hard to get more literal than Mariasol. The Mexican spot is located at the end of the Santa Monica pier, so you’ll have a clear view of the sunset and the Santa Monica, Venice, and Malibu beaches. This isn’t the kind of place that LA locals frequent, but it’s a great place to sip a margarita and stare at the ocean while you’re on vacation (or staycation). Warning: if you’re sitting outside (which you should be) don’t let the seagulls steal your food!

## 3.Upstairs at the Ace Hotel

![The Ace Hotel is one of 5 Restaurants with Breathtaking Views in Los Angeles](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201074%20848'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![The Ace Hotel is one of 5 Restaurants with Breathtaking Views in Los Angeles](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-30-at-12.31.21-PM.png)The bar and restaurant on top of The Ace Hotel has one of the best views of downtown. You can walk around the entire rooftop bar and pool deck and see views from all sides of the building. On one side you’ll see “Downtown’s Turquoise Gem” the Eastern Columbia Building. The building is the greatest example of Art Deco east of the Mississippi. Keep walking around the rest of the deck to get the layout of downtown.

## 4\. The Restaurant at The Getty Center

[![The Restaurant at the Getty Center is one of 5 Restaurants with Breathtaking Views in Los Angeles](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%202048%201345'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![The Restaurant at the Getty Center is one of 5 Restaurants with Breathtaking Views in Los Angeles](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/03/14315018588_c18c72f4da_k.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/03/14315018588_c18c72f4da_k.jpg)

The Getty is a great art museum in LA. Because it’s perched up high, it also has great views. Museum food isn’t something that’s usually very exciting, but most museum food doesn’t come with a view of the Santa Monica Mountains and the ocean. Stop in for lunch, dinner, Sunday brunch, or just dessert and wine. The menu changes seasonally, but the backdrop is a staple all year round.

## 5\. The Castaway

[![Castaway is one of 5 Restaurants with Breathtaking Views in Los Angeles:](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20685'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Castaway is one of 5 Restaurants with Breathtaking Views in Los Angeles:](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/03/5198631524_d167853a73_b.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/03/5198631524_d167853a73_b.jpg)

Schelp out to Burbank for a meal? If you want a great view of the Verdugo Mountains, yes. The back patio sticks out from a hillside and is covered with fire pits. There’s also koi ponds and a waterfall if the view doesn’t bring you enough inner peace. The Castaway serves a weekend brunch buffet, lunch, dinner, and a special “Sunset Menu”, which you should probably drink a glass of wine next to a firepit.
