#  5 Places to Eat Before Your Hollywood Cocktail Tour 

April 11, 2018 

We recommend having a bite to eat before you [visit three bars](http://avitaltours.com/los-angeles/tour/hollywood-cocktail-tour/) and learning about Hollywood history. (We all have not-so-fond memories of drinking on an empty stomach, right?) Plus, there’s so much great food in the neighborhood, you might as well make an event out of it. Here are five places to eat before your Hollywood Cocktail Tour.

## 1\. Pizzeria Mozza

[![pizza at pizzeria mozza: 5 Places to Eat Before Your Hollywood Cocktail Tour](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/10386482476_99755f0551_k.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/10386482476_99755f0551_k.jpg)

Who loves Nancy Silverton? We do. And we love great pizza, which isn’t easy to find in LA. So [Pizzeria Mozza](http://la.pizzeriamozza.com/) is a no-brainer recommendation. This is the kind of place where’s you’ll want to split a pizza or two, but you don’t want to miss the appetizers (fried squash blossoms anyone?!), so bring a few friends and share. And of course, you’ll want the Butterscotch Budino. Don’t worry if you leave full, you’ll walk it all off during your tour.

_641 N Highland Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90036_

## 2\. Baroo

[![fermented food at baroo: 5 Places to Eat Before Your Hollywood Cocktail Tour](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20640%20480'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![fermented food at baroo: 5 Places to Eat Before Your Hollywood Cocktail Tour](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/22776118562_3796e4e8ac_z.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/22776118562_3796e4e8ac_z.jpg)

For a pre-tour meal that’s easy (both in the ordering and on the wallet), head to [Baroo](http://baroola.strikingly.com/). Like many great LA restaurants, Baroo is located in a strange strip mall. (So don’t panic, you’re in the right place.) The small changing menu is focused on fermented foods. Expect dishes like Kimchi Fried Rice, handmade pasta, and homemade pickles. And wash it all down with house-fermented kombucha.

_5706 Santa Monica Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90038_

## 3\. Sugarfish

[![sushi dinner: where to eat before your hollywood cocktail tour](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%202048%20910'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![sushi dinner: where to eat before your hollywood cocktail tour](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/12/Sushi-at-Sugarfish-one-of-the-Best-Celebrity-Spotting-Restaurants-in-Los-Angeles.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/12/Sushi-at-Sugarfish-one-of-the-Best-Celebrity-Spotting-Restaurants-in-Los-Angeles.jpg)

Sugarfish is an LA classic, for good reason. If you’re looking for sushi that’s reliably great, the [Hollywood](http://sugarfishsushi.com/our-locations/hollywood/) location has your back. Note that the location doesn’t take reservations, so expect some wait time. However, you’ll be dining early ahead of your tour, so the wait should be manageable. We always recommend the “Trust Me” menu, but you won’t go wrong with anything Chef Nozawa puts on your plate.

_6115 Sunset Blvd #170, Los Angeles, CA 90028_

## 4\. Animal

[![bone marrow at animal : 5 Places to Eat Before Your Hollywood Cocktail Tour](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20768'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![bone marrow at animal : 5 Places to Eat Before Your Hollywood Cocktail Tour](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/6079113084_517ce34032_b.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/6079113084_517ce34032_b.jpg)

Calling all carnivores: [Animal](http://www.animalrestaurant.com/) is your pre-tour dinner spot if you love meat. The restaurant is owned by the same team behind some of the other best restaurants in LA, like Kismet, Jon & Vinny’s, and Trois Mec, so it’s clear they’re experts in hospitality. They’re also experts in cooking up lamb, turkey, beef, pork, chicken, quail, rabbit, and more in both classic and unique ways.

_435 N Fairfax Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90036_

## 5\. Jinya Ramen Express

[![ramen is a quick solution for 5 Places to Eat Before Your Hollywood Cocktail Tour](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%202048%201536'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![ramen is a quick solution for 5 Places to Eat Before Your Hollywood Cocktail Tour](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/15513300039_84cfa62194_k.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/15513300039_84cfa62194_k.jpg)

Running late because of traffic on the 10? Same. The express version of[ Jinya Ramen Bar](https://jinya-ramenbar.com/menu/) will fill you up quickly before your tour. The location is right in the middle of Hollywood, and there’s parking in the mall underneath. So take a breath, slurp some Spicy Umami Miso Ramen, and get ready to relax.

_6801 Hollywood Blvd. Suite 317 Los Angeles, CA 90028._
