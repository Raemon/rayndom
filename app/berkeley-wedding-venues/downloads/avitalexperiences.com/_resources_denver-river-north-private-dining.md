If you’re looking for something beyond a standard private dining room, our [Interactive Meal](https://avitalexperiences.com/experiences/denver-interactive-meal/) is the way to go! The actual Denver restaurant venue changes based on your group’s goals, but every RiNo restaurant partner we have is absolutely awesome.

The base of the experiences is a multi-course, seated meal with beverage pairings. But what makes it unique, is that we layer on a trio of foodie activities, like making your own cocktail (or mocktail), culinary trivia withe prizes, and a signature flavor finale experience. The experience is hosted so organizers can just sit back and enjoy the event! It’s your meal and activity, all in one.
