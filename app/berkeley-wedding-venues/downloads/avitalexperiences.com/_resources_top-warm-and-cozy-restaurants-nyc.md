## 1\. **Maison Premiere**

Maison Premiere is all about ambiance. As soon as you step inside the small restaurant, you’re immediately transported to the French Quarter in New Orleans or a cozy bar in Paris. From the antique liquor bottles behind the bar, marble countertops, and flickering candles on tiny tables, you’ll soon find yourself warmed up with an absinthe cocktail in your hands. Presentation is key at Maison Premiere, and whether you’re enjoying oysters from the raw bar or a bowl of seafood gumbo, you’ll feel far away from the cold, if only for a little while.

## 2\. **Paulie Gee’s**

A pizza joint might not be what comes to mind when you think of warm and cozy restaurants, but at [Paulie Gee’s](https://pauliegee.com/greenpoint/) the wooden tables and close quarters will have you thinking otherwise. If you’ve been seeing someone new, Paulie Gee’s is the right combination of casual and romantic, but has the perfect atmosphere for a group of friends as well. Plus, pizza made in a wood-fired oven has an undeniable warming effect.

[Ruffian](http://ruffiannyc.com/) uncorks some of the best bottles of wine and serves up small plates with loads of flavor. This wine bar is practically the definition of cozy, with a 19-seat bar and an open kitchen. Prepare to sit in close quarters to your fellow wine lovers, and also be ready to try wines from Northern France, Austria, and the Republic of Georgia. A glass or two will help you brave the walk to the subway, or at least keep you warm while you wait for your Uber.

In an ideal world, you’d find yourself in Northern Italy on a chilly winter evening with a bowl of luscious handmade pasta in front of you, rolling hills or snow-capped mountains in the background. Alas, that’s an adventure for another time. But the good news is that there are plenty of warm and cozy Italian restaurants in NYC, and one of our personal favorites is [Il Buco](https://ilbuco.com/pages/il-buco#shopify-section-restaurant-menu). This Soho mainstay started as an antique shop and eventually turned into one of the best places to enjoy a comforting bowl of _zuppa,_ perfect ribbons of housemade _tagliatelle_ , and delicious, creamy risotto. Everything about Il Buco will make you happy you went out for dinner and didn’t decide to stay in your apartment all winter.

When the Abramcyk siblings decided to open up [Tiny’s & The Bar Upstairs](https://www.tinysnyc.com/), they wanted to create a neighborhood spot that evoked charm, warmth, and made anyone feel at home. They absolutely succeeded—the pink townhouse in Tribeca that’s home to this warm and cozy restaurant is a New York City landmark. The rustic setting in this historical 1810 building gets an orange glow from the fireplace, keeping you snug and relaxed all night long.

This cozy spot, located on East 2nd Street, is a must-try for Northern Italian cuisine. Try their handmade kale gnocchi, head in on a Wednesday night for lasagna night, or order the risotto of the day. Whatever you decide, I promise you won’t be disappointed! But don’t let the name fool you, you can have brunch at [Supper](https://www.supperrestaurant.com/) too. This isn’t your ordinary brunch spot though. Spice up your regular brunch routine with a zucchini tagliatelle or grilled polenta and poached eggs. Now that’s amoré, my friends!

![medium_large](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20768%20735'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![medium_large](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/thursday-kitchen-via-thursdaykitchen-768x735.png)

## 7\. Thursday Kitchen

[Open in Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UJzHXojDkUMncFXT9)

Start your weekend early at [Thursday Kitchen](https://www.thursdaykitchen.com/). In fact, it’s how their name came to be. When Thursday night plans are uncertain, they want to turn that uncertainty into a definite feeling of excitement that you’ll get when you know that’s where you’re headed! Serving international tapas, with French techniques and Spanish and Asian ingredients, you’re in for an explosion of flavors! This place is so cozy, you may actually miss the entrance. It’s tucked away down a set of stairs, which will take you into this dimly lit, warm environment. Get ready to cuddle up!

![medium_large](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20768%20768'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![medium_large](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/pylos-via-resy-768x768.jpg)

[Open in Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/U2eGLA6wP7X1XFxa6)

Get [yourself] to the Greek! Well, to [Pylos](https://pylosrestaurant.com/) at least. I had to add it to the list because Greek food is one of my favourite cuisines and this snug little spot be sure to thrill you. The octopus, the moussaka, the stuffed grape leaves, you can’t choose just one dish – so I encourage you to share a few plates! While you’re there, be sure to take in the décor on the ceiling. Pylos [pronounced Pee-‘los) is the root word that includes things of clay. The restauranteurs have incorporated this into their interior using clay pots as their ceiling design. It’s been said that clay pots, found among the ruins of ancient Greece held clues to daily Hellenic life.

Calling all _Friends_ fans! This corner spot has been used as the exterior to the iconic _Friends_ apartment building, but it is so much more than that. Nestled in the middle of a beautiful neighborhood, this Greenwich Village staple has been around for 15 years – and that’s an accomplishment for any restaurant in NYC. Serving modern Mediterranean dishes, head to [Little Owl](https://www.thelittleowlnyc.com/) to people watch on their outdoor covered patio or even just to cozy up solo at the bar with a glass of wine. Before you go, make sure they’re open as they tend to close up shop between their lunch and dinner seatings!
