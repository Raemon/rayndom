This is the most obvious of birthday party ideas, but also completely customizable. It’s what I did for my 30th birthday! Start planning well in advance to secure the venue of your choice. You can go high-brow and invite an intimate group to enjoy a memorable meal in the back room at [Tosca Cafe](http://toscacafesf.com/) or downstairs at [Beretta](http://berettasf.com/). However, if lowbrow is more your style, host a get-together for everyone you know at the bar. Reserve the back couch area at [Comstock Saloon](http://www.comstocksaloon.com/), or grab a couple of tables beside the smoking cage at [Rye](http://www.ryesf.com/), or snag the upstairs balcony at [Rickhouse](http://www.rickhousebar.com/).

Check out our list of [best restaurants in San Francisco](https://avitalexperiences.com/resources/best-restaurants-in-san-francisco/) to ensure an amazing experience.

Join us for a [North Beach food tour](https://avitalexperiences.com/experiences/san-francisco-north-beach-food-tour/)! This is the perfect experience for lovers of Italian food. While we bring you to each of the 3-4 best restaurants in North Beach San Francisco, we will tell you the history of this area, the Barbary Coast, which was one of the most notorious spots in all of America during the Gold Rush. 

If you would like to upgrade your experience, we have three perfect beverage pairings on offer. Without spoiling the surprise, some dishes you might get to sample on this tour would be: cioppino (a tomato-based seafood stew invented in SF!), wood-fired pizza, or cannolis!

### 3\. Bring your Crew to Alcatraz for a Spooky Night Tour

Fisherman’s Wharf

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2040%2040'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/price-icon.svg)

$$

The [Alcatraz night tours](https://www.alcatrazislandtickets.com/Alcatraz-Night-Tour/) are wildly popular, so you may want to buy tickets a couple of months before your 30th to ensure you get enough for your friend group. The round-trip ferry ride serves alcohol, so you’ll be able to sip an uncomplicated drink or two on the boat ride. You’ll certainly need the liquid courage, as Alcatraz at night can be spooky! 

The cells are cold and dark, and with the twinkling lights of San Francisco visible from the island, you’ll realize why a stay at The Rock could drive prisoners crazy. When you arrive back on the mainland, play tourists and head to Fisherman’s Wharf and grab classic SF eats at [Capurro’s](http://capurros.com/). Then end the night with a sundae at [Ghirardelli Square](http://www.ghirardellisq.com/shops/ghirardelli-chocolate/) or Irish coffee at the [Buena Vista Cafe](http://thebuenavista.com/index1.html).

### 4\. Go Wine Tasting in Sunny Sonoma

$$$

Rent a limo or bus to take you to beautiful Sonoma County. It’s a little less commercial than Napa and more off the beaten track. 

Start with a group tasting at [Hamel Family Wines](http://hamelfamilywines.com/), a stunning ranch with a modern architectural building and friendly, welcoming staff. As you listen to the large soothing stone fountain and sip superb Sauvignon Blanc, you won’t care that you’re a year older. 

From there, move on to [Scribe](http://www.scribewinery.com/), everyone’s favorite hipster winery with a rustic hacienda for a tasting room and a stunning hillside view of the German grape varietal vineyards.

Hopefully, you thought ahead and packed a basket of artisanal local cheese and charcuterie, fresh fruit, and baguettes because the next stop, [Gundlach Bundschu](http://www.gunbun.com/), is the perfect place for a birthday picnic. Call ahead to reserve a wooden table that overlooks the lake, then pop into the tasting room for a bottle or two of their easy-to-drink Rosé and luscious Tempranillo. 

Last stop on your 30th birthday Sonoma wine tour? [Patz and Hall](https://www.patzhall.com/). The house-like tasting room has couches for chilling, a large bar, and a food and wine pairing that you won’t want to miss. Be sure to pick up some of their sparkling wine for the ride back to the city.

![Cavallo Point in san francisco](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20963%20642'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Cavallo Point in san francisco](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cavallo-Point-in-san-francisco.jpg)

### 5\. Take the Ferry to Sausalito and Enjoy Cavallo Point

On weekdays, there are eight boats (starting at 10:40 am and ending at 6:45 pm) that leave the San Francisco Ferry Building. The half-hour ride has a fully operating bar and spectacular views of the city, the Golden Gate Bridge, and Alcatraz. 

Grab some pals and head over early in the day to enjoy all that Sausalito has to offer. Walk around the intimate shops, sip a glass of wine or icy beer, and sample caviar at the [California Caviar Company](http://www.californiacaviar.com/). Then head to [Cavallo Point](http://www.cavallopoint.com/?phonalytics=26s&gclid=Cj0KEQjw0tCuBRDIjJ_Mlb6zzpQBEiQAyjCoBtBU5KcMdOI6qgrFV4Wo-m9jID8lWje90KniyB2o9BQaAkWa8P8HAQ), which is home to a chic lodge, restaurant, and spa. Book treatments in advance and spend the afternoon being pampered with a massage, facial, or scrub. Once you’re feeling relaxed, head to the patio for a cocktail and appetizers. Just be back at the Sausalito Ferry Building to catch the final boat that departs for the city at 7:30 pm!

### 7\. Cable Car Ride followed by a Picnic in the Park

One of the most memorable 30th birthday parties I attended was completely unexpected: 10 of us met at the Powell and Market Street cable car line, rode the car, then had a fabulous picnic in the park. Here’s how you can too: 

  * Ask everyone to bring a bottle of wine and different snacks. 
  * Wait in line at Powell Street (yes, with the tourists!) and hop aboard the Powell-Mason cable car. 
  * Pose for selfies, sip wine from water bottles, then hop off at Mason Street and Union Street. 
  * Walk three blocks and you’ll come to Washington Square Park. 
  * While most SF natives prefer to picnic in Dolores or Golden Gate Park, Washington Square Park is a wonderful spot for a picnic. The majestic Saints Peter and Paul Church towers over the flat grassy park. 
  * After you’ve finished your picnic, head to [Rogue Ales Public House](http://www.rogue.com/), [15 Romolo](http://www.15romolo.com/), or [Tony Nik’s Cafe](http://tonyniks.com/).

### 8\. Head out to Tomales Bay for a Picnic at Hog Island Oyster Farm

$$

You’ll need a couple of designated drivers for this celebration, as the drive is about an hour and 15 minutes (depending on where you leave the city) to Marshall, where the [Hog Island Oyster Farm](https://hogislandoysters.com/) is located. The ride is worth the drive as you’ll spend the day grilling oysters, admiring the view, and chatting with friends. You’ll need to bring grilling tools and food items to pair with the oysters (we recommend some fresh bread from [Tartine](http://www.tartinebakery.com/)!), but the farm provides the oysters, gloves, and shucking tools.

San Francisco doesn’t have the sunniest of beaches, which makes them the ideal place for beach bonfires. You’ll need plenty of wood and lighter fluid, plus blankets and provisions. Set up shop just before the sun sets, then watch the day turn to night in all its orange glory. 

Ocean Beach is our top pick for the location because they already have fire pits set up that you can use, making everything easy! Fill thermoses with calm chowder and make a big batch of Manhattans. Grab some bread, cheese, and a Princess cake from [Victoria Bakery](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Victoria-Pastry-Company/130166702475) and you’ve got yourself one awesome party.

Here are our favorite men’s 30th birthday party ideas. Again, all genders may find these party ideas fabulous, but we find these tend to appeal most to a male audience.

If you’re looking for unique 30th birthday party ideas for him, and you’re into games, consider reserving a couple of lanes at [Mission Bowling Club](http://missionbowlingclub.com/) to celebrate your 30th birthday. Start with dinner upstairs, the burger and fried chicken on a stick are must orders, then move downstairs to play some serious rounds of bowling while you sip pitchers of beer or excellently crafted cocktails. Let the staff know you’re bringing a birthday cake and they’ll help you serve it up. 

After the tournament, keep the party moving with late-night revelry at nearby [Dr. Teeth & the Electric Mayhem](https://teethbarsf.com/).

### 27\. Take the Boys Out to the Giants Game

If your birthday takes place between April and October, celebrate with the eight-time World Series champions, the San Francisco Giants. Games take place often, and there are different tiers of seating options. Book a box for you and your friends to hang out in or get a bunch of bleacher seats and have your buddies meet you out behind center left field. 

Before the game, sip on beers and nosh on bar snacks at [Public](http://www.publichousesf.com/)[ House](http://www.publichousesf.com/) or [21st Amendment](http://21st-amendment.com/). After the game, go to [Momo’s](http://www.sfmomos.com/) to keep the party going.

Vroom, vroom baby! Helmet on and buckle up for a night of go-karting with your boys at [K1 Speed](https://www.k1speed.com/adult-parties.html). And it’s not just a night of go-karting. You can play video games in their arcade room, go bowling, or play cyber sports. You can even play some of the classics like Pool, Jenga, Foosball, or Cornhole (one of my personal favorites). It’s like a million parties in one!

## 30th Birthday Party Theme Ideas

Perhaps you want to host your 30th party at home, but with an awesome theme! We love this idea. Not only is it budget-friendly, but a theme always makes a party more memorable. Here are our favorite party themes for 30th birthdays. 

![90s grunge 30th birthday party theme](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20963%20642'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![90s grunge 30th birthday party theme](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/90s-grunge-30th-birthday-party-theme.jpg)

### 29\. 90s Grunge

If you’re turning 30, you were a ’90s baby. Celebrate the era of your birth by cultivating a playlist of the best ’90s hits. Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins, and Radiohead better be making an appearance! Have your friends arrive in grunge attire. Break out the flannels and distressed jeans, or get a little punk and bring out the leather and spikes. Then end the night by putting on a popular 90s movie like Clueless or Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas!

![y2k 30th birthday party theme](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20963%20642'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![y2k 30th birthday party theme](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/y2k-30th-birthday-party-theme.jpg)

### 30\. Y2K

In line with our last idea, you were a child of the early aughts. One of the most iconic fashion eras of the last 50 years! If you’ve been holding on to your low-rise jeans and Juicy Couture jumpsuit, this will finally give you the perfect excuse to pull them out of the back of your closet. 

You could create a Spotify playlist for the event, but if you have an old boombox or, better yet, an iPod with a speaker, it could lend some next-level ambience to the event! For the finishing touches, stock the snack table with nostalgic treats, like push pops and cosmic brownies, and serve the most popular cocktails of the early 2000s, like an Appletini or Cosmo.

![murder mystery 30th birthday party theme](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20963%20642'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![murder mystery 30th birthday party theme](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/murder-mystery-30th-birthday-party-theme.jpg)

### 31\. Murder Mystery

This theme takes a little planning, but we promise it’s worth the extra effort! When you send out your birthday party invites, include a character description for what role your friends will be playing at your murder mystery theme party. You can keep it basic and assign them whether they’re a guest or the murderer, or you can create elaborate character profiles for everyone. 

Or it could be fun to base it on the game Clue and assign everyone a familiar character! No matter which route you go, a murder mystery theme is one of the most engrossing interactive party ideas that will keep your guests entertained for hours.

![roaring 20s for 30th birthday party theme](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20963%20642'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![roaring 20s for 30th birthday party theme](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/roaring-20s-for-30th-birthday-party-theme.jpg)

### 32\. Roaring 20s

This theme is a classic for a reason! I don’t know if it’s because The Great Gatsb _y_ was assigned reading for all of us, or the aesthetics of the 20s just never went out of style, but this is one of the most popular birthday theme parties out there! 

Get the men to wear their finest suits, and the women to don flapper dresses and feathered headpieces. Sip the finest champagne (or $7 Barefoot sparkling Moscato, we won’t tell) out of tall glasses, and keep a long cigarette holder poised between your fingers (for show only, of course.) When the moment is right, put a “[How to Charleston](https://youtu.be/W_g8rZHJEEY?feature=shared)” video on the big screen, queue up “Le Jazz Hot” and dance the night away with your best friends!

![casino night for 30th birthday party theme](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20963%20642'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![casino night for 30th birthday party theme](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/casino-night-for-30th-birthday-party-theme.jpg)

### 33\. Casino Night

Turn your Home into a casino for one night only to celebrate your 30th birthday! All you need to do is set up a few fold-out tables, some packs of cards, poker chips, and keep the alcohol flowing. No real money needs to be involved to make this night a hit! You could either play with something like wrapped candy, start everyone out with about 25 pieces, and allow them to take home their winnings at the end of the night. Or give out 100 poker chips per person, and for every 50 each person has won/kept by the end of the party, give them one lottery ticket. End the party with a drawing to see who wins the silly or special items you pick out as prizes![](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2015/09/9.jpg)

## How to make a 30th birthday extra special?

To make a 30th birthday feel extra special, plan a unique experience like a private dinner, weekend getaway, or unique activity tailored to the guest of honor’s interests. For more budget-friendly options, consider a themed party or picnic.

## How do 30 year olds celebrate their birthday?

30 year olds celebrate their birthdays with experiences over things. Think dinner parties, travel, bar crawls, adventure outings, or themed celebrations with friends.

## What’s a dirty 30 party?

A “Dirty 30” is a playful nickname for a 30th birthday celebration. These parties often feature cheeky themes and bold decorations. Think dance parties, cocktails, themed dress codes, or wild weekend trips with friends. The idea is to celebrate turning 30 with humor, confidence, and a little bit of over-the-top fun.
