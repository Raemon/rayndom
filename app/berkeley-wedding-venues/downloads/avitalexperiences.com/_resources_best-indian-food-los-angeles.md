#  The Best Indian Food in Los Angeles 

December 13, 2016 

Whether you prefer to dine in or take-out, Indian food is a reliable favorite. It’s hard not to be happy with tikka masala and naan in hand. LA is a huge city, so finding the best Indian food in Los Angeles is no easy task. We asked some locals where they go to get their fix and they gave us these five favorite spots.

(A local Los Angeles tip: If you haven’t been to [Artesia’s Little India](http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/guide/neighborhood-guide-artesias-little-india/), go. You’ll find a high concentration of some great food. But we wanted to provide some restaurants spread around the city, too)

Here’s a map of the Best Indian Food in Los Angeles:

## **Mayura**

[![The Best Indian Food in Los Angeles includes Mayura in Culver City](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20640%20480'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![The Best Indian Food in Los Angeles includes Mayura in Culver City](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/12/Mayura-Restaurant-made-our-list-of-The-Best-Indian-Food-in-Los-Angeles.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/12/Mayura-Restaurant-made-our-list-of-The-Best-Indian-Food-in-Los-Angeles.jpg)

A friend who lives on the west side turned us onto Mayura in Culver City. The restaurant, whose name means peacock in Sanskrit, is regionally specific to Kerala, South Indian. The restaurant has separate vegetarian and non-vegetarian kitchens, so all types of eaters are satisfied. LA Times food editor Jonathan Gold put Mayura on his list of the 101 Best Restaurants in LA, so we believe that this is some of the best Indian food in Los Angeles. Mayura believes it too. On its website there is a section titled “Why Mayura is the best Indian restaurant in Culver City”.

## **India’s Grill**

[![For The Best Indian Food in Los Angeles try Malai Kofta at India's Grill ](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20640%20425'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![For The Best Indian Food in Los Angeles try Malai Kofta at India's Grill ](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/12/Malai-Kofta-at-Indias-Grill-makes-it-some-of-The-Best-Indian-Food-in-Los-Angeles.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/12/Malai-Kofta-at-Indias-Grill-makes-it-some-of-The-Best-Indian-Food-in-Los-Angeles.jpg)

Two longtime LA residents claim that India’s Grill has the best malai kofta they’ve ever had. The restaurant has been around since 1998, so the two brothers who run the spot are doing something right. When you talk into India’s Grill, expect to be greeted with a “Namaste” (yes, the same word that ends your yoga class). India’s Grill takes customer satisfaction seriously. On their website, they claim that brothers and executive chefs “Darshan Singh and Tarsem Singh are aimed to attain complete satisfaction from you. They will be heartbroken if you feel otherwise”. We don’t think you’ll be disappointed (or heartbroken) if you stop in for a meal.

## **Tara’s Himalayan Cuisine**

[![Momos are Himalayan and Tara's is still some of The Best Indian Food in Los Angeles](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20640%20424'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Momos are Himalayan and Tara's is still some of The Best Indian Food in Los Angeles](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/12/Momos-like-the-ones-served-at-Tara’s-Himalayan-Cuisine-on-the-list-of-The-Best-Indian-Food-in-Los-Angeles.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/12/Momos-like-the-ones-served-at-Tara’s-Himalayan-Cuisine-on-the-list-of-The-Best-Indian-Food-in-Los-Angeles.jpg)

This is a little different than the Indian food you might be used to. The Tara’s recommendation came to us from a friend who has been brought to Tara’s by a few northern Indian folks, so he says the cuisine is authentic as well as delicious. Tara’s serves Himalayan cuisine from Nepal and Tibet. The restaurant is serious about authentic flavor-their mountain grown herbs and spices come directly from Nepal. Tara, the owner, is a classically trained dancer who wanted to share her love of Nepali culture and give back to the place where she grew up. Ten percent of profits from the restaurant go towards a goal of rebuilding a school in Nepal. Doing good and eating well? Yes, please.

## **Al Noor**

[![ Al Noor, is known for its garlic naan and some of The Best Indian Food in Los Angeles](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20640%20480'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![ Al Noor, is known for its garlic naan and some of The Best Indian Food in Los Angeles](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/12/Get-Garlic-Naan-at-Al-Noor-some-of-The-Best-Indian-Food-in-Los-Angeles.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/12/Get-Garlic-Naan-at-Al-Noor-some-of-The-Best-Indian-Food-in-Los-Angeles.jpg)

Al Noor isn’t really a hidden gem since it’s gotten many accolades from food critic [Jonathan Gold](http://www.alnoor-restaurant.net/Reviews.html). Al Noor’s website also brags (deservedly) that Eric Greenspan featured the restaurant on a garlic-themed episode of “The Best Thing I Ever Ate” for its garlic naan. As much as we trust these famous food figures, the recommendation was solidified by friends who vouched for how good Al Noor is. The restaurant also serves Pakistani food.

## **Samosa** **House**

[![Samosa House serves some of The Best Indian Food in Los Angeles](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20640%20480'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Samosa House serves some of The Best Indian Food in Los Angeles](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/12/Get-Samosas-at-Samosa-House-some-of-The-Best-Indian-Food-in-Los-Angeles.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/12/Get-Samosas-at-Samosa-House-some-of-The-Best-Indian-Food-in-Los-Angeles.jpg)

This is a favorite among Indian-food-loving vegetarians and vegans. In addition to serving some of the best Indian food in Los Angeles, Samosa House West has one of Southern California’s largest Indian supermarkets. So if you’re inspired by the many curries and pakoras, head to the store to buy ingredients and make your own. Samosa house has locations in Santa Monica, Silverlake, West LA, and East LA, so no matter where you are in the city, great Indian food is close by.
