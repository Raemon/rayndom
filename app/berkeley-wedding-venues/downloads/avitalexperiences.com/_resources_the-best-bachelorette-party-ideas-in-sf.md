#  The Best Bachelorette Party Ideas in SF 

January 25, 2018 

Yes, you can head to Vegas for some debauchery on The Strip, but there are tons of ways to have pre-wedding celebrations right here in San Francisco. If you’re looking for something a little more low-key than a classic bachelorette bash, check out our list of the best bachelorette party ideas in SF.

## Go To The Spa

[![The Best Bachelorette Party Ideas in SF: go to kabuki spa in japantown for a relaxing day](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20500%20370'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![The Best Bachelorette Party Ideas in SF: go to kabuki spa in japantown for a relaxing day](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/01/300380542_6157ab742d_z.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/01/300380542_6157ab742d_z.jpg)

The [Kabuki Springs and Spa](http://kabukisprings.com/) is one of our favorite places in the city. For a mellow celebration, we recommend treating any bride a day at the spa. (She might also love a few hours of eating ramen in neighboring Japantown.) Stop in for a soak in the communal baths, a massage, a facial or some acupuncture. They even have a [Sushi and Sator](http://kabukisprings.com/services/sushi-satori-package/)i package for groups, so your party can get a private room to relax over platters of sushi with included massages and baths. The [Onsen](https://www.onsensf.com/) in the Mission is also great, but smaller and you can even enjoy a meal in their restaurant after bathing.

## Take A Curated Cocktail Tour

[![head to union square cocktail tour for Bachelorette Party Ideas in SF](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%202048%201365'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![head to union square cocktail tour for Bachelorette Party Ideas in SF](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/12/Grab-a-cocktail-and-live-music-at-Black-Cat-home-of-one-of-The-Best-Happy-Hours-in-Union-Square.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/12/Grab-a-cocktail-and-live-music-at-Black-Cat-home-of-one-of-The-Best-Happy-Hours-in-Union-Square.jpg)

Kick off your night with a [Union Square cocktail tour](http://avitaltours.com/san-francisco/tour/union-square-cocktail-tour/). Take the bride-to-be and the rest of the crew on a curated night bar crawl. Our guides will take you to three bars in Union Square and introduce you to bar owners, bartenders, and industry experts. You’ll sample three cocktails on the unique cocktail experience. The best part? You’ll be done by 7:00 so the night is still young, and you’ll be warmed up for more bachelorette fun.

## Laugh Together At Beach Blanket Babylon[![bachelorette party ideas in SF: beach blanket babylon](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%202354%201176'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![bachelorette party ideas in SF: beach blanket babylon](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-22-at-4.05.31-PM.png)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-22-at-4.05.31-PM.png)

[This show](https://www.beachblanketbabylon.com/) has been running for more than 16,00 performances and is one of the funniest musicals around. Grab some tickets and head to the theatre at Club Fugazi in North Beach. When you order group tickets, you can request a hosted bar with champagne. If the bubbly isn’t enough, North Beach is filled with bars like[ 15 Romolo ](http://www.15romolo.com/)and [Comstock Saloon](https://comstocksaloon.com/drink/) for some post-play drinks.

## Partake In Tea and Tonga At The Fairmont Hotel

[![head to the fairmont hotel for The Best Bachelorette Party Ideas in SF](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20640%20426'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![head to the fairmont hotel for The Best Bachelorette Party Ideas in SF](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/12/One-The-Best-Happy-Hours-in-Union-Square-is-at-the-Tonga-Room.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/12/One-The-Best-Happy-Hours-in-Union-Square-is-at-the-Tonga-Room.jpg)

Transition from day to night at the Fairmont Hotel. Hit the Laurel Court Restaurant & Bar for[ afternoon tea ](http://www.fairmont.com/san-francisco/dining/afternoon-tea-at-fairmont-san-francisco/)and load up on scones, sandwiches, and pastries. Then later, go downstairs to the [Tonga Room](http://www.tongaroom.com/) and Hurricane Bar for a funky tiki bar experience. Sip on mai tais and pina coladas and keep your eyes peeled for the fake thunderstorms and rainstorms. Then, dance all night to the live band, which floats on a tiki boat above the pool.

## Rent a Boat

[![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20640%20480'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/best-bachelorette-party-ideas-in-SF-boat.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/best-bachelorette-party-ideas-in-SF-boat.jpg)

Living in San Francisco, you can take advantage of being on the water. Head to [Sausalito ](http://www.sfbayadventures.com/)and rent a boat whether it’s a small private party or a boat big enough for a whole gang of your besties. Sailboats, catamarans, small crafts or motor yachts are some of the options to consider. And, of course, the views will be all yours to enjoy from any boat. 

## **Calistoga Hot Springs**

[![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20640%20480'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/best-bachelorette-party-ideas-in-SF-calistoga.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/best-bachelorette-party-ideas-in-SF-calistoga.jpg)

Calistoga Natural Mineral Hot Springs is definitely one of the most relaxing places to have an awesome bachelorette party. Choose from several [spa](https://www.romanspahotsprings.com/)s in town and be pampered with a mud bath, massage or other available spa treatments. Remember to enjoy a glass or three of wine right by the pool. 

## **Progressive Meal**

[![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20532'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Valentines-Day-Weekend-Singles-Culinary-Experience-cheers.jpeg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Valentines-Day-Weekend-Singles-Culinary-Experience-cheers.jpeg)

Nobody says “no” to a good meal. And if the meal is paired with a choice of not one but four great restaurants, and chaperoned by a great [storyteller](http://avitaltours.com/san-francisco/) – it’s bound to be a winner. Bring your #teambride team on a three-hour culinary experience in [Mission](http://avitaltours.com/san-francisco/tour/mission-district-food-tour/), [Tendernob](http://avitaltours.com/san-francisco/tour/tendernob-food-tour/), or [North Beach](http://avitaltours.com/san-francisco/tour/north-beach-food-tour/). You’ll all get acquainted with the neighborhood and its culture and food scene, while having plenty of time to sit down and chat at each of our partnering restaurants.

## **Photo Class**

[![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20640%20480'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/best-bachelorette-party-ideas-in-SF-cameraclass.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/best-bachelorette-party-ideas-in-SF-cameraclass.jpg)

Everybody’s taking pictures daily, but not too many know how to take a great one. Use your party as a chance to improve your photo skills. You and your gals can develop your photographic talent with a beginners class, or a more advanced photo walk. Options are available at studios in San Francisco. Check out local business [Isla Studio](http://islastudio.com/classes/).
