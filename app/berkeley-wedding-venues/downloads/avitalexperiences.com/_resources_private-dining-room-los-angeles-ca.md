## Regular LA **Private Dining Room vs. Interactive Meal**

![private dining room los angeles ca](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20900%20700'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![private dining room los angeles ca](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/private-dining-room-los-angeles-ca.jpg)

### **What is a Private Dining Room in Los Angeles, CA?**

Private dining rooms in LA offer an exclusive, private space within a restaurant just to your group. With features like customized menus, dedicated staff, AV equipment, and a quiet ambiance, it’s ideal for more special or formal occasions, like corporate dinners, milestone celebrations, or team building events. These event spaces are often beautiful, but they often lack interactive elements or unique touches. 

![group at outdoor bar during avital interactive meal in los angeles](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20900%20700'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![group at outdoor bar during avital interactive meal in los angeles](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/group-at-outdoor-bar-during-avital-interactive-meal-in-los-angeles.jpg)

### **What is an Interactive Meal?**

[Avital’s Interactive Meal](https://avitalexperiences.com/experiences/los-angeles-interactive-meal/) is a unique dining experience that combines delicious food and drinks with hands-on, hosted activities. The meal takes place in a private or semi-private dining room of your choice (from Avital’s network of restaurant partners in LA), and includes a 4-course meal, 3 beverages, and 3 hosted foodie activities—think hands-on cocktail making, themed trivia with quirky prizes, and a flavor finale featuring perspective-shifting flavor experiments. All of the exclusivity of a private dining room, with the added bonus of interactive elements.

##### Your Meal, Your Activity

In addition to all of the food and bev, the Interactive Meal includes 3 hands-on activities—cocktail-making, themed foodie trivia, and a Flavor Finale with buzz button lollipops and miracle berries.

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/verified-icon.svg)

##### More Opportunity to Mingle

Guests get up from their seats to mix and mingle, creating a more dynamic atmosphere and more authentic connection.

##### Hosted Experience

An expert Avital Emcee facilitates the event, so the organizer can relax and enjoy the experience without having to manage it.

##### Venue Selection & Turnkey Booking

Avital coordinates with the restaurant to find the perfect venue for your group and handles all of the logistics, so you can just show up on the day of the event.

##### Dietary Restrictions

Avital takes care of all dietary needs, ensuring everyone is included and cared for.

##### Simplified Pricing

Unlike traditional private dining which is convoluted with minimums and gratuity, Avital offers clear and easy-to-understand pricing per person. 

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/star-icon.svg)

##### Branded Opportunities

Customize materials, including menus and cocktail recipes, to reflect your brand. Great for client entertainment dinners.

### **Comparison: Private Dining Room vs. Interactive Meal**

Although we’re biased and think the Interactive Meal is totally awesome, we recognize there’s still a time and place for a classic private dining room. If your goal is intimate conversation or hosting a more serious affair, a private dining room without the interactive elements is likely your best bet. It’s also the ideal choice if you have a long presentation to give during dinner—a traditional private room provides the quiet, focused environment you need.

## **Private Dining Room in Los Angeles Alternatives**

Not sure if a private dining room is the right fit? Here are some great alternatives to a regular private dining room. There are group reservations which are great for more casual or smaller events, all the way to restaurants buyouts for big celebrations. This is an overview of private dining options in LA – to see a full comparison chart, head over to our [LA private dining guide](https://avitalexperiences.com/los-angeles/private-dining/#private-dining-options). 

### **Group Reservation**

Reserve tables within a restaurant for your group without exclusivity. Typically you can make the reservation online without any back and forth with a private dining manager. This is a budget-friendly option for smaller, casual gatherings. While it’s cost-effective, it lacks the privacy of a dedicated space and not many customization options.

### **Semi-Private Dining**

Semi-private spaces are partitioned areas within a restaurant that offer partial exclusivity. These spaces are ideal for medium-sized events where privacy isn’t a top priority but a bit of separation is appreciated. Groups can typically still enjoy the hustle and bustle of the main dining room which can feel exciting and fun. 

### **Restaurant Buyout**

A restaurant buyout gives you and your group exclusive access to the entire venue. It’s perfect for large-scale events like weddings, company-wide celebrations, or high-profile gatherings. With a buyout, you have full control over the setup, menu, and ambiance.

### **Event Space Rental**

Renting an event venue in Los Angeles offers flexibility for larger gatherings or unique setups. You can bring in your own caterers, decor, and [event entertainment](https://avitalexperiences.com/interactive-bars/) to create a fully customized event. The cost of renting an event space in LA varies but you can expect to pay at least $500 for smaller venues, plus the cost of food and drinks. 

### **Catering at Your Location**

Hosting your event at home, in the office, or another private location? Catering services bring restaurant food and service to you, but in the comfort of your own space. This option is great for those seeking complete control over the environment while still enjoying delicious food.
