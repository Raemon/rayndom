#  14 Unique Virtual Team Building Activities for Remote Teams 

July 30, 2021 

Let me take you back to a time not too long ago. It’s the start of the pandemic, you and your team just started working from home, and everyone’s morale is…well, it’s not great. You wonder, _what am I going to do to get my team motivated again?_ You’re googling “virtual team building activities for remote teams.” There are too many options, so you settle on getting “drinks after work” over Zoom or “giving back some time” to your team by letting them go early on a Friday. You’re a good boss.

Fast forward to present day and working from home is the “new normal” (did anyone cringe when I said that? No? Good.) You may even have members on your team that you haven’t met yet as they onboarded while working from home. You want to connect, keep morale high and get your team excited by offering some rad team-building exercises.

Well, have no fear, this blog post is here! We have gone ahead and done the work for you. We wanted to create a list that encouraged collaboration and building connections, all accomplished from the comfort of your own home.

These activities encourage teamwork and learning about each other’s strengths, weaknesses, and interests. Team building exercises foster an atmosphere of communication and creativity, an atmosphere that thrives when your team members feel comfortable with one another. And finally, these activities are a great way to let loose and build memories together.

**Here’s our list of fourteen exciting virtual team building activities for remote teams. Regardless of size, these are guaranteed ways to bring your team together.**

## **9\. It’s the Five Finger Showdown (da-na-na-nahh, da na na na nahhh)**

*to the tune of The Final Countdown. Put five fingers up and get ready to learn about your co-workers. You might find your long lost soul family! The idea is to go around the group and have each person mention one unusual life experience. For example, speaks more than one language, eats peanut butter and honey on their toast every morning, you get the idea. If a team member has that life experience, they put a finger down. Make it more interesting: Once you see who’s put a finger down, open the floor to share about their experience.

## [![sign-truth-lie-virtual-truth-or-dare-game](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![sign-truth-lie-virtual-truth-or-dare-game](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/virtual-game-of-truth-or-dare.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/virtual-game-of-truth-or-dare.jpg)

## **10\. Challenge your team to a game of Truth or Dare.**

Let’s take things up a notch, shall we, with a virtual game of Truth or Dare. Everyone starts with their cameras on. The facilitator states a truth or dare, such as, show your phone background. Players keep their cameras on to indicate they are willing to reply. The host then asks a few players to complete the truth or dare. The successful player leads the next prompt. May the odds be ever in your favor!

[![virtual-team-building-game-of-psych](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![virtual-team-building-game-of-psych](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/virtual-game-of-psych.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/virtual-game-of-psych.jpg)

## **11\. Psych!** **Find out how your team members would react in certain situations.**

This game will really get your creative juices flowing. To play, one person enters each team member’s name into Psych. The game then generates customized questions, like how would Judy fight off a team of bears? (Poor Judy…). Each player will then write a witty response and at the end of the round everyone votes on who had the best answer. Points are rewarded by ranking. The goal is to have the most points at the end of the game. 

## [![virtual-game-of-telephone-for-teambuilding-remote](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![virtual-game-of-telephone-for-teambuilding-remote](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/virtual-game-of-broken-telephone.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/virtual-game-of-broken-telephone.jpg)

## **12\. Build communication skills with See What I Mean?**

Put your communication skills to the test with this classic game of Telephone, but with a twist – art. One participant draws a picture using only basic shapes. A selected team member will then try to explain the picture to the rest of the team. Everyone will attempt to replicate the picture without ever having seen it. The goal is to recreate the same picture as the original.

## [![girl-singing-karaoke-virtual-jukebox-game-teambuilding](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![girl-singing-karaoke-virtual-jukebox-game-teambuilding](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/virtual-karaoke-singing.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/virtual-karaoke-singing.jpg)

## **13\. Take center stage with Jukebox**

Warm up those vocal chords and think of your favorite song! Go around the group and take turns humming or singing a part of the song. Have your co-workers try to guess the artist and song name. Not only do you come out with a new, fun playlist, but belly laughs are guaranteed to ensue as you find out who would not make it to the finals in American Idol. 

[![college-campus-for-virtual-tour-for-remote-teams](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![college-campus-for-virtual-tour-for-remote-teams](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/virtual-college-campus-tour.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/virtual-college-campus-tour.jpg)

## **14\. Revisit the ‘ole college days.**

Do you and your team talk about the good ‘ole days? Do you ever wonder what your colleague was like in college? Well, look no further. Have a college night! Encourage everyone to show up in merch from their alma mater, take out those red solo cups and add in some virtual drinking games (non-alcoholic is encouraged too!). Who knows? You might just realize you were on the same campus as your colleague all those years ago. 

The most important part to remember about virtual team building activities for remote teams is to have fun! You want your team to have the chance to bond, connect, and learn about each other all while enjoying themselves.
