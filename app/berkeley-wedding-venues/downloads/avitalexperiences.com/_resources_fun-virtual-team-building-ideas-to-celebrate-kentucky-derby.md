Updated April 30, 2025

Celebrate “the greatest two minutes in sports” with the help of hats, horses, and of course, lots of mint juleps. Bringing the spirit of Kentucky to your team building event is a fun way with these Kentucky Derby ideas for groups. Plus, most of these ideas can be mixed-and-matched into one event if you’re really looking to do it up. Tell everyone to dust off their best hats because we’re off to the races! 

## **[![have-a-hat-party-for-virtual-team-building-ideas-to-celebrate-kentucky-derby](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![have-a-hat-party-for-virtual-team-building-ideas-to-celebrate-kentucky-derby](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/women-wearing-big-hats-during-virtual-team-building-ideas-to-celebrate-kentucky-derby.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/women-wearing-big-hats-during-virtual-team-building-ideas-to-celebrate-kentucky-derby.jpg)  
1\. Have a hat party & contest**

Speaking of hats, a Kentucky Derby party wouldn’t be complete without them. Kentucky Derby fashion is refined yet fabulous all in one — the bigger the feather and brighter the colors, the better. Have a hat party and contest for your team building event as you invite everyone to pull out their best looks. Explore [Kentucky Derby fashion inspo](https://thehatgirls.com/pages/kentucky-derby-style-guide) to get in the swing of things. 

## **[![doing-kentucky-derby-crafts-for-virtual-team-building](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![doing-kentucky-derby-crafts-for-virtual-team-building](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/do-dyi-projects-for-virtual-team-building-ideas-to-celebrate-kentucky-derby.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/do-dyi-projects-for-virtual-team-building-ideas-to-celebrate-kentucky-derby.jpg)  
  
2\. Create DIY derby decorations**

Prep your [Derby decorations](https://www.thepondsfarmhouse.com/3-easy-diy-derby-party-decorations/?srsltid=AfmBOorHs2q_MJwKGeDNmsyisT-GiN-GOw9vJM7xeT0kh6JurmQWvQf9) ahead of time with your team for a relaxed craft session. Make a jockey silk garland, horseshoe, and a paper flower fascinator for your hair. There are even kids activities as well to make this a family friendly event. 

## **[![red roses for virtual team building to celebrate Kentucky derby](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![red roses for virtual team building to celebrate Kentucky derby](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/make-rose-centerpiece-for-virtual-team-building-ideas-to-celebrate-kentucky-derby.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/make-rose-centerpiece-for-virtual-team-building-ideas-to-celebrate-kentucky-derby.jpg)  
3\. Make roses the centerpiece of your event**

The “Run for the Roses” needs roses, of course! Send your guests some roses so they can spruce up their background or make a “Run for the Roses” horseshoe together. Everyone will feel like a champion with a bouquet of roses on Derby Day. 

## **[![mixologist with mint julep for virtual team building ideas to celebrate kentucky derby](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![mixologist with mint julep for virtual team building ideas to celebrate kentucky derby](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/craft-mint-julep-for-virtual-team-building-ideas-to-celebrate-kentucky-derby.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/craft-mint-julep-for-virtual-team-building-ideas-to-celebrate-kentucky-derby.jpg)  
4\. Elevate your mint julep with a mouthwatering twist**

Do Derby Day right by concocting the perfect cocktail: A mint julep. For virtual teams, consider booking a [virtual happy hour with kits delivered](https://avitalexperiences.com/experiences/virtual-happy-hour-with-cocktail-kit/). For in-person teams, book a [hands-on cocktail bar](https://avitalexperiences.com/experiences/hands-on-cocktail-bar/) and the team at Avital will bring the fun to your event.

## **[![play kentucky derby trivia during virtual team building](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![play kentucky derby trivia during virtual team building](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/horses-running-during-kentuky-derby.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/horses-running-during-kentuky-derby.jpg)  
  
5\. Play some Kentucky Derby trivia**

For the trivia buffs out there, some good ol’ fashioned Kentucky Derby trivia is easy to put together. Use a pre-made set of questions or take on the challenge of coming up with your own. Feel free to ask your guests to dress up, get some music playing, and pour some bourbon. 

## **[![men riding horses during kentucky derby](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![men riding horses during kentucky derby](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/vintage-kentucky-derby-race.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/vintage-kentucky-derby-race.jpg)  
6\. Watch past races together**

Since the races aren’t actually that long, it’s easy to watch more than one together. With 147 years of history, you might even want to catch a documentary about the Derby too. [There’s plenty to mine through on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=past+kentucky+derby) that will help build excitement for race day. 

## **[![black stallion horse in open field](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![black stallion horse in open field](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/black-stallion-in-field.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/black-stallion-in-field.jpg)  
  
7\. Watch some great horse movies to get you excited**

Host a movie night and watch one of the [best horse racing movies](https://www.ranker.com/list/list-of-all-horse-racing-movies/ranker-film). With the help of watch party features on most streaming platforms, you can set up a Kentucky Derby movie night. Serve or send popcorn and other snacks for a nice evening. 

## **[![virtual team building horse betting game for kentucky derby ](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![virtual team building horse betting game for kentucky derby ](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/horse-betting-board-for-virtual-team-building-ideas-to-celebrate-kentucky-derby.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/horse-betting-board-for-virtual-team-building-ideas-to-celebrate-kentucky-derby.jpg)  
8\. Host a horse-racing party**

Make everyone feel like jockeys with the [“At the Races”](https://meetmaxgames.com/virtual) virtual event. You train your horse, sabotage your rivals, back your favorite horse, and try to win in over six races. Instead of spectating, put yourself in the horse’s shoe (sorry, we had to). A great option for virtual teams. 

## **[![visit a virtual horse farm for virtual team building](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![visit a virtual horse farm for virtual team building](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/horses-on-peaceful-farm.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/horses-on-peaceful-farm.jpg)  
9\. Visit the horse country**

If you’re not much of a racer but still want to spend time with horses, a visit to a farm is in order. Spend time with these majestic animals, either at a local farm near you, or through [Horse Country Virtual Tours](https://visithorsecountry.com/virtual-tours/). Either way you’ll get up close and personal with these incredible animals. It will help you appreciate the Derby even more! 

## **[![woman listening to kentucky derby music during virtual team building](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![woman listening to kentucky derby music during virtual team building](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/listening-to-kentucky-derby-music.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/listening-to-kentucky-derby-music.jpg)  
  
10\. Stream the ‘Party Up At The Downs’ playlist**

What’s a Derby party without My Old Kentucky Home playing in the background? [This Derby Day playlist ](https://www.amazon.com/Party-Up-At-Downs-Official/dp/B001UUZL62)brings the sounds of Churchill Downs to your home with lively folk music and more. If you’d like a night of live music, hire a band for your event for a cool, intimate experience. 

## **[![virtual oyster shucking class for virtual team building ideas to celebrate kentucky derby](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![virtual oyster shucking class for virtual team building ideas to celebrate kentucky derby](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/oysters-for-virtual-team-building-ideas-to-celebrate-kentucky-derby.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/oysters-for-virtual-team-building-ideas-to-celebrate-kentucky-derby.jpg)  
  
11\. Try an oyster shucking class**

The Derby is all about colorful, luxurious fun, and while you could make some Southern snacks together for your team building event, an oyster shucking class brings that luxury to you. You and your team will learn how to properly shuck, plus explore unique pairings. 

## **[![bourbon tasting during virtual team building ideas to celebrate kentucky derby](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![bourbon tasting during virtual team building ideas to celebrate kentucky derby](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/whiskey-tasting-for-virtual-team-building-ideas-to-celebrate-kentucky-derby.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/whiskey-tasting-for-virtual-team-building-ideas-to-celebrate-kentucky-derby.jpg)  
12\. Do a bourbon tasting**

For an iconic taste of Kentucky, try a bourbon tasting class. Learn about the notes and nuances that go into making Kentucky bourbon with an expert, and travel to the Bluegrass State together. 

## [![virtual-zoom-background-for-derby](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![virtual-zoom-background-for-derby](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/kentucky-derby-zoom-background.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/kentucky-derby-zoom-background.jpg)

## 13\. Change up the scenery

You need to feel the energy of the Kentucky Derby – so for virtual teams, encourage everyone to change up that Zoom background to one of the racetracks! You can also add some fun props, like paper prize ribbons, trophies, little flags and mini binoculars. Get creative and have some fun with it – it’s the Derby after all!

## [![virtual-dress-up-for-derby](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![virtual-dress-up-for-derby](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/43.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/43.jpg)

## 14\. Play dress up

Just because you’re not actually at the race track does not mean you don’t dress up. I mean, half the glamour of the Kentucky Derby is in the outfits – not just the hats! I’m talking men in full suits, women in dramatic dresses and printed ensembles. You can even make it a little interesting and have a contest! 

## [![kentucky-derby-bets](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![kentucky-derby-bets](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/44.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/44.jpg)

## 15\. Play pin the tail on the…horse

Let’s make things a little interesting, shall we? Place bets on which horse tail will get the closest. Now, I’m not saying to actually bet money, but you can bet fun things. The person who wins gets an extra day off work or can delegate a task to someone else. It can even be something as simple as sending the winner their meal of choice once the Derby is over.

Whether your team likes to celebrate with food and drink, fun games, or some friendly competition, we’ve got an option for you. When it comes to team building to celebrate the Kentucky Derby, horsing around is highly encouraged! We’ll bring the cocktails!
