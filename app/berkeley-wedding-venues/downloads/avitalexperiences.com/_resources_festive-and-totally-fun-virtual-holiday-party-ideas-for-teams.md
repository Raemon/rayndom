### 8\. Paint & Sip

Think of it like a double whammy: A fun holiday team-building event + a potential gift for a loved one!

### 9\. Build a Wreath 

I love wreaths! They just make your home look so cozy and inviting in the wintertime. This is definitely one of my favorite virtual holiday party ideas. Imagine this, instead of buying a beautiful wreath to hang on your front door for the holidays, you make one yourself? Well, that’s exactly what you can do with [Floraloom Studio](https://floraloom.com/kits). You start off by picking your kit style, customize it to fit your group, and boom! You have an expert Floraloom designer to take you through the creative process.

### 10\. Improv/Stand-up Class

I know the thought of being up on a stage might be quite scary, but improv is incredible for your communication and resolution skills. You’re forced to come up with a sentence, comment, or comeback on the spot. And not to mention, it’s hilarious! With [Laughter on Call](https://www.laughteroncall.com/our-services/), their “Happier” Hour is a 45-minute event where participants are led in a unique combination of Improv games and stand-up prompts. Get ready for hilarity to ensue!

### 11\. DIY Holiday Cards

Design holiday cards with your team! I’m sure you have lots of people to send these cards to so why not draw them up yourself? Use this [drawing kit ](https://www.amazon.com/Sketching-Supplies-Sketchbook-Tutorial-Watercolor/dp/B092Z1PYCD/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=1I46UKDYF3R38&dchild=1&keywords=drawing+kit+for+adults&qid=1633400341&sprefix=drawing+kit+for%2Caps%2C177&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFFVzkxS0k2QkZDWTcmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTAwOTMwMDUxTFE4RUE5WkFRN1VJJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAzNTMzODkxUUVNMEhCUDY1NzQzJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==)to get those creative juices flowing! You can pick a drawing online and try to recreate it as a team or you can go rogue and draw something up that you’ve created. If you’re not the pen and paper type, try an online tool like Canva.

### 12\. Make Origami Decorations 

Although quite a niche event, Origami is a great virtual holiday party idea for your team! It’s fun, creative, and has a multitude of benefits. With this [virtual origami class](https://www.withconfetti.com/product/virtual-origami-class), you can also choose to bring your own supplies or have them delivered right to your door. You’ll experience live demos led by an expert, learn origami basics, and folding techniques.

![hands making candle during virtual holiday party ](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![hands making candle during virtual holiday party ](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/candle.jpg)

### 14\. Candle Making Class

Candles are the greatest to have around during the holidays. And how cool it would be to have your own candle that you made yourself! There are several [candle making classes](https://www.bookelevent.com/collections/virtual/crafts-and-gardening/candle-making?utm_source=snacknation&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=virtual-candle-making-class) to choose from base on your budget, but they all tend to be around $60-90 per person, with kits included. 

![hands decorating christmas cookies - one of Avital Experiences' last minute holiday party ideas for work](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![hands decorating christmas cookies - one of Avital Experiences' last minute holiday party ideas for work](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hands-decorating-christmas-cookies-one-of-Avital-Experiences-last-minute-holiday-party-ideas-for-work.jpg)

### 14\. Cookie Decorating

We know the holidays are a time to ditch the diet and enjoy all the holiday desserts. That’s why you should encourage your team to participate in a [Cooking Decorating Class](https://tudorhousecookies.com/corporate/) with Jacqueline Terrel, winner of the Food Network’s Christmas Cookie Challenge. I can guarantee you your family, spouse or friend would love to get in on the fun, so it’ll also be a great way to introduce your loved ones to the team. ****

### 15\. Gingerbread Wars

Gather your team members around the globe for some fun with [Gingerbread Wars](https://gingerbreadwars.com/)! Before the event even starts, you’ll be mailed holiday kits with everything you need to participate. On the day of the event, you’ll be put through multiple challenges over a course of 90-minutes. During one of the games, Gingerbread Self-Portraits, you’ll create a mini version of yourself – I’d advise you to really have some fun with this part! At the end, you’ll get to eat all the ginger-y goodness at the end all while sitting in the comfort of your jammies. I’d say that’s a pretty great win!

![casino night for 30th birthday party theme](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20963%20642'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![casino night for 30th birthday party theme](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/casino-night-for-30th-birthday-party-theme.jpg)

### 16\. Vegas Game Night

Bring your best poker face to a [Virtual Casino Night](https://www.funcasinonights.com/virtual-casino.html). Whether you’re playing Blackjack, Three-Card Poker or Texas Hold ‘Em, it’s an exciting way to celebrate the end of the year! Here’s a rundown of how it’ll go: Upon joining the table, each player will have their chips and digital name presented on the table. Our professional Croupier will then explain the proceedings of the evening and rules of the game(s). Players then have the allocated time to accumulate as many chips as possible in the hope of winning at the end of the event.

![murder mystery 30th birthday party theme](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20963%20642'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![murder mystery 30th birthday party theme](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/murder-mystery-30th-birthday-party-theme.jpg)

### 17\. Holiday Murder Mystery

Before you say that a Murder Mystery doesn’t sound like one of your usual virtual holiday party ideas, hear me out. It’s a [holiday-themed murder mystery](https://www.murdermysteryco.com/virtual-office-christmas-party), so you’ll be working with your team to solve this festive whodunnit. Actors will guide you through the murder mystery as you collaborate to crack the case.

## Free Virtual Holiday Party Ideas for Work

If you don’t have a big budget (or any budget at all) there are still plenty of low-cost or even free virtual holiday party ideas for work. 

### 18\. Show Off Your City

The holidays are a beautiful time in every city or town. Each town has its own unique way of celebrating the holidays, so whether you’re living up north, where you get piles of snow, or you’re surrounded by palm trees in the middle of December, take pictures and show your home off! Take pictures of your favorite holiday decorations around your town and have a slide show showing off the Holiday traditions where you live. 

### 19\. Give Back to Your Community 

If your team works remotely, you may not be able to volunteer in person together for the holidays. A virtual auction is an excellent way to give back and make a contribution as a team. Find local shops in your city or town and have them each donate one item. The team can then auction to buy the item, while the company donates the proceeds to a charity of your choosing.

### 20\. Holiday Movie Dubbing 

Host a Holiday Movie dubbing party and get everyone laughing! It’s a fun twist on a classic improv game. I mean, we’ve all seen _Who’s Line Is It Anyway?_ Right? So here are the rules: you play clips from your favorite holiday movie on mute while a group dubs over what they think the characters are saying! If you’ve seen the movie before, have some fun with it! If not, even better. That’s when you can really get creative!

### 21\. Share Family Traditions

Since the holidays are a time to share in the love, why not share a lovely family tradition. And I know we all have that one tradition that we love during the holidays! Maybe you say your rose and thorn of the year or maybe you go around and tell your favorite childhood memory. Whatever it is, I’m sure your team would love to share in it (and learn a little about each of you in the process).

### 22\. Bake Together

Eating delicious food and baked goodies is a rite of passage during the holidays. Especially if you have treats where the recipe has been passed down for generations. So why not have a fun baking class where one person sends around a family recipe, and everyone bakes it? You and your team can bake them before the Zoom holiday party and wait to try them all together, or bake while you spend time together. The only cost is the cost of the ingredients. 

## Virtual Holiday Party Games

If you’ve already got your virtual holiday party planned, but are just looking for some fun games to add to the fun, this section is for you. 

### 23\. Holiday Hijinks

[Virtual Holiday Hijinks](https://www.outbackteambuilding.com/remote/virtual-holiday-hijinks/) is the perfect way to get in the holiday spirit all while improving the communication and collaboration with your team. Over the course of up to 2 hours, teams of 4-8, you’ll be solving a variety of holiday-themed challenges. As you complete the challenges, you’ll earn points that you help you climb up the leaderboard. May the odds be ever in your favour!

### 24\. Virtual Holiday Scavenger Hunt

This game is a fun way to share items you have around your home! Here’s how it works. Have one person running the game who will list off each item you need to find. If you need some ideas, check out this list by [Simple Simon & Company](https://www.simplesimonandco.com/2020/12/christmas-scavenger-hunt-virtual.html/). Each player will have 60-90 seconds to find the item and show it off! The person who comes back the fastest gets the point. Tally them up at the end, and you have yourself a winner, all while learning more about your colleagues!

![woman opening corporate gift box](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20900%20700'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![woman opening corporate gift box](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/woman-opening-corporate-gift-box.jpg)

### 25\. White Elephant Gift Exchange 

Enjoy a fun little [gift exchange](https://www.whiteelephantonline.com/how-to-play) where you really don’t know what you’re going to get! The way it works is everyone “brings” a gift (i.e. link a product online and add a photo). Each person will begin with one wrapped gift. As the game goes on, you can either unwrap your gift or steal for someone else’s. It’s always best to set a price limit so gifts are comparable.

![playing bingo for holiday party for remote team](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201050%20700'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![playing bingo for holiday party for remote team](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/playing-holiday-bingo.jpg)

### 26\. Play Bingo

Who doesn’t love bingo? Seriously! It’s one of the best games out there (and people get oddly competitive about it. Well, actually, that’s me – I’m ‘people’). Gather everyone round for an ‘ole-fashioned game of [bingo](https://myfreebingocards.com/virtual-bingo). Players can choose to play on-screen or print their cards.

### 27\. Name That Tune Holiday Edition

Sing or hum your heart out with Name That Tune! Here’s how you play. Go around the “room” and each player has to hum or sing a holiday song while the other players race to identify the song title. Humming is hard enough but if they want to sing the song, ask your player to turn their mic onto mute so you can only read their lips. Add a little competition by breaking up the group into teams and see how fun it gets! Here are a few [great holiday song suggestions ](https://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/g29326536/best-christmas-songs/)to add to your list.

### 28\. Game Show Extravaganza

Why choose one game when you can choose them all? With the [Virtual Game Show Extravaganza](https://feetfirstevents.com/virtual-game-show-extravaganza/), you’re getting Family Feud, Random Trivia, and Minute to Win It-style games. The best part is that these games can be customized to include questions about your company, industry, and even individual participants.

### 29\. Naughty List Game

Yes, this is work appropriate! It’s a variation on the game Never Have I Ever, but you play with statements about the holidays. Everyone starts with 10 fingers up. If they have done whatever the statement says, they put a finger down. At the end, the player with the most fingers still up wins. To further engagement, with each statement, the facilitator can ask the team member to share their story! This’ll help everyone connect and learn more about each other. [Here are some questions](https://wagner.edu/alumni-friends/files/2020/11/The-Naughty-List-Game-1.pdf) to get you started.

### 30\. Virtual Musical Chairs

This is one of our favorite free virtual holiday party ideas for work groups. Remember playing Musical Chairs when you were a kid, and how you’d make a mad dash for that last chair? Then you’ll know exactly how to play the Singer’s Version. Here’s how it works. The facilitator starts playing a song, let’s say it’s holiday-themed, and everyone starts singing as loud as possible. The facilitator then shuts off the song, at random, and the last person left singing loses. Check out this [list of holiday songs](https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/commentary/ct-perspec-holiday-songs-ranked-best-worst-100-petri-1216-20181212-story.html) if you need some inspo.

### 31\. **Never Have I Eve** r

This classic party game is a great icebreaker! It’s always fun to see who’s done what and learn the things you have in common with fellow co-workers. So, whether you’re sipping on hot chocolate or a nice Baileys on the rocks, play this fun game – with a holiday twist. If you’re not sure what to ask, here’s a list of suitable holiday questions!

## Best Virtual Holiday Party Themes

Themes elevate company holiday celebrations, creating unique experiences that your group will remember for the entire year. These innovative [holiday party themes for work](https://avitalexperiences.com/resources/holiday-party-themes-for-work/) help companies distinguish their celebrations and create memorable experiences that employees discuss long after the event.

![ugly christams sweaters for holiday party themes for work](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![ugly christams sweaters for holiday party themes for work](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/corporate-holiday-party-themes-cozy-sweater.jpg)

### 32\. Ugly Sweater Contest

Ugly sweater contests encourage festive fashion and friendly competition while maintaining a lighthearted atmosphere. This theme works exceptionally well for casual workplace cultures, encouraging creativity and humor while providing natural conversation starters. Judging categories can include “Most Creative,” “Funniest,” and “Most Festive,” with prizes adding excitement to the competition.

### 33\. Winter Wonderland 

A winter wonderland theme transforms any venue into a magical holiday escape with white decorations, snowflakes, and silver accents. You can create a virtual background with these elements and send it out to your employees. With programs like Zoom it’s easy to upload the image and use it as your background. Encourage your employees to dress in the color palette of whites, silvers, and light blues to create an elegant atmosphere that photographs beautifully and appeals to diverse tastes.

### 34\. Vintage Holidays

Vintage holiday themes featuring retro decorations from the 1950s or 1960s add nostalgic charm. You can send out vintage holiday cards as invites, and play period-appropriate music all night long. You can find a detailed list of the best Christmas hits from the 1950s [here](https://foreverchristmas.ca/1950s-the-golden-age-of-holiday-music/). This approach creates unique photo opportunities and conversation pieces while offering a fresh take on traditional holiday aesthetics.

### 35\. Holiday Movie Costumes

We all have that one movie we MUST watch during the holidays. So why not have a little costume fun and come dressed up as your favourite character? Maybe National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation is your favorite, or you want something a little more comfortable, so you come dressed as Scrooge. Whatever you pick, costume parties are always a fun time! If you’re looking for a little help coming up with a character, here’s a [list of holiday movies](https://www.listchallenges.com/75-holiday-movies) you can check out. 

### 36\. Holidays Around the World

Holidays Around the World celebrations embrace diverse cultural traditions, making the party more inclusive for multicultural teams. This theme allows employees to share their cultural Holiday traditions through food, decorations, music, and customs, creating educational opportunities and fostering appreciation for diversity within the workplace. Encourage your team to go around and share a Holiday tradition by cooking a traditional food, showing off their decorations, or teaching the team about their favorite Holiday costumes.

### 37\. Tropical Holiday Escape

Tropical holiday themes offer an escape from winter with Hawaiian shirts and summer vibes, providing a refreshing alternative to traditional winter celebrations. This unexpected approach works especially well in cold climates! Tell the team to come in Hawaiian shirts and summer shorts (since the only commuting they’ll be doing tonight is walking from the kitchen to the living room). If they want to mix up a Mai Tai or snack on watermelon slices, that’s fair game tonight!
