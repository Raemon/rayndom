#  The Top 10 Things to Do in San Francisco 

October 13, 2017 

The year is quickly coming to an end. And with the holiday season about to kick off, things are going to be getting even busier. Remember to make time for adventures and good eating during the rest of 2017. Not sure what you need to squeeze in? Here is our list of the top 10 things to do in San Francisco 2017.

## 1\. Tell a Story at The Moth

[![Story Slam made our list of The Top 10 Things to Do in San Francisco 2017](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20720%20540'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Story Slam made our list of The Top 10 Things to Do in San Francisco 2017](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/27044964634_97c401039a_b.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/27044964634_97c401039a_b.jpg)

We’re big believers in the power of storytelling. The Moth is coming to San Francisco for their story slam for four dates throughout the rest of the year at The Castro Theatre and Public Works. Each story slam has a different theme which is released beforehand so you can prep your story. Of course, you can go and just watch, but we encourage you to try your hand at storytelling yourself!

_Various locations_

## 

## 2\. Play at Color Factory[![The Top 10 Things to Do in San Francisco 2017: Color Factory](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%202048%201365'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![The Top 10 Things to Do in San Francisco 2017: Color Factory](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/37146049160_21cfb355e5_k.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/37146049160_21cfb355e5_k.jpg)

Need a play break? Then visit this building in Union Square which has been transformed into a temporary Color Factory. Each room celebrates different colors and experiences to go along with them. Swim around in the yellow ball pit, run around in a sea of rainbow ribbons, color a wall with giant green markers, and toss around rainbow confetti. Kids and grown-ups around SF have been snagging tickets so fast it’s been sold out, but more tickets may be released during the limited run.

_575 Sutter Street, San Francisco, CA 94102_

## 3\. Go on a Cocktail Tour

[![Cocktail tour: The Top 10 Things to Do in San Francisco 2017](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20600'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Cocktail tour: The Top 10 Things to Do in San Francisco 2017](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/11/Josh-at-Burritt-Room-speaking-to-San-Francisco-Cocktail-Tour.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/11/Josh-at-Burritt-Room-speaking-to-San-Francisco-Cocktail-Tour.jpg)

Cocktail trends are always changing, so learn about what’s hot in 2017 as well as classic cocktails on a cocktail tour. Extend “happy hour” to happy **hours** and meet bar owners, bartenders, and industry experts at three Union Square cocktail havens. You’ll learn the origins and back-stories of the spirits in the cocktails and you’ll get some San Francisco-specific trivia, too.

_Union Square, San Francisco_

## 4\. Visit the “Soundtracks” Exhibit in SF MOMA

[![The Top 10 Things to Do in San Francisco 2017: SF MOMA](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20768'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![The Top 10 Things to Do in San Francisco 2017: SF MOMA](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/34471568634_75edea0c6e_b.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/34471568634_75edea0c6e_b.jpg)

_Soundtracks_ ends on January 1, 2018, so you better visit 2017. The exhibit focuses on “the role of sound in contemporary art”. Expect pieces such as film scores and visualizations of sound and spatial relationships throughout the museum. Of course, while you’re visiting visit the MOMA’s other world-class offerings.

_151 Third Street, San Francisco, CA 94103_

## 5\. See Flying Dinosaurs at California Academy of Sciences

[![Cal Sciences: The Top 10 Things to Do in San Francisco 2017:](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20768'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Cal Sciences: The Top 10 Things to Do in San Francisco 2017:](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/4673766034_ec0f310be6_b.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/4673766034_ec0f310be6_b.jpg)

If you or someone in your life loves dinosaurs, head to the Cal Academy of Sciences to see Pterosaurs: Flight in the Age of Dinosaurs. The exhibit showcases flying reptiles called pterosaurs. Pterosaurs had wingspans up to 33 feet so expect big creatures, but only for a little longer. The exhibit is only on display through early January

 _55 Music Concourse Drive, San Francisco, CA 94118_

 _[www.calacademy.org/pterosaurs](https://www.calacademy.org/pterosaurs)_

## 6\. Go to the Theatre

[![The Top 10 Things to Do in San Francisco 2017: theatre](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20765'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![The Top 10 Things to Do in San Francisco 2017: theatre](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/2772272666_c497f241a1_b.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/2772272666_c497f241a1_b.jpg)

Sure, Hamilton wa the biggest play to visit SF this year, but there is lots more theatre to see before the new year. The Orpheum theatre is hosting [The Waitress](https://www.shnsf.com/Online/default.asp?doWork::WScontent::loadArticle=Load&BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::article_id=9E20BFCD-116B-43C9-BA22-853C4FE31990), [An Evening with David Sedaris](https://www.shnsf.com/Online/default.asp?doWork::WScontent::loadArticle=Load&BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::article_id=42BF9393-AA77-4940-8E9C-1ED43551EAF8), and [Aladdin](https://www.shnsf.com/Online/default.asp?doWork::WScontent::loadArticle=Load&BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::article_id=4DCD751E-9952-495C-9734-1491C7323B5C) during the rest of the year. The[ SF Opera ](https://sfopera.com/)has multiple productions happening throughout 2017. And [theatres around San Francisco](https://www.san-francisco-theater.com/) will be showing everything from 42nd Street to a Christmas Story to Steve Martin’s Bright Star

_Multiple locations_

_[www.san-francisco-theater.com/](https://www.san-francisco-theater.com/)_

## 

## 7\. Watch the Warriors

[![The Top 10 Things to Do in San Francisco 2017:Warriors Game at Oracle ](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%202048%201536'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![The Top 10 Things to Do in San Francisco 2017:Warriors Game at Oracle ](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/8605629282_238c884f27_k.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/8605629282_238c884f27_k.jpg)

You technically have to cross the bridge to Oakland (at least until the new stadium is built) but the games are worth it. The Warriors have kept a strong winning streak the past few seasons and Steph Curry doesn’t look like he’s going anywhere soon. So snag tickets to a game and see the Bay Area team score in person, even if it’s in nosebleed seats.

7000 Coliseum Way, Oakland, CA 94621

## 8\. Visit the Museum of Ice Cream

[![Museum of Ice Cream is on our list of The Top 10 Things to Do in San Francisco 2017](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%202048%201365'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Museum of Ice Cream is on our list of The Top 10 Things to Do in San Francisco 2017](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/34410794424_476020eaa0_k.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/34410794424_476020eaa0_k.jpg)

If you’ve always dreamed of jumping into a pool of sprinkles of being surrounded by life-size ice pops, dream no more. The Museum of Ice Cream, which is in San Francisco for a limited run, is less of a museum of more of a fun house. You’ll get to taste different SF ice creams and see ice cream inspired art in a walk-through experience. Don’t forget your camera and a sweet tooth.

_1 Grant Ave, San Francisco, CA 94108_

## 9\. Watch Movies in Wine Country

[![Napa film fest: The Top 10 Things to Do in San Francisco 2017: ](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201782%20396'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Napa film fest: The Top 10 Things to Do in San Francisco 2017: ](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-05-at-4.09.06-PM.png)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-05-at-4.09.06-PM.png)

Head north to Napa to for the annual Napa Valley Film Festival. The festival lasts from November 8-12 for five days of films, food, and wine. Even if you’re not into the flicks, more than 50 chefs and restaurants will be represented at the festival, so you can focus on meals instead of movies.

## 10\. Alameda Point Antiques Faire

[![The Top 10 Things to Do in San Francisco 2017: Alameda Point Antiques Faire](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20531'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![The Top 10 Things to Do in San Francisco 2017: Alameda Point Antiques Faire](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/4839859207_2d7ea2b5b8_b.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/4839859207_2d7ea2b5b8_b.jpg)

Whether you’re shopping for gifts or just for yourself, there are lots of treasures to be found at the Alameda Antique Faire. The monthly event takes place on the first Sunday of the month. There’s also a separate, but equally well stocked, [Fashion Faire](http://www.alamedapointantiquesfaire.com/test4-fashionFaire-1.php). While you’re in Alameda explore the very cute downtown area.
