#  The 20+ Best 40th Birthday Party Ideas in San Francisco 

August 29, 2016 

Forty is a big year. Some people panic about a “mid-life” crisis, but we’re the kind of people who prefer to celebrate and embrace getting older, instead of panicking about it! To celebrate looking ahead to the next half, we’ve put together a list of our favorite 40th birthday party ideas in San Francisco. From sailing to a real island to drinking on a fake one, these ideas span from active to very relaxing, so you can spend your day however you want to—and hopefully with a drink in hand and some good food nearby.

## Our Top Picks for Birthday Party Ideas for Your 40th Birthday

  * **For Foodies** : We have ideas from [birthday party food tours](https://avitalexperiences.com/birthday-party/) to the coolest dinner experiences.
  * **For Gamers** : Why not try a historical mini golf course or an old-school arcade?
  * **For Entertainment** : Bathe in sound at The Audium or take in John Foley’s Dueling Pianos.
  * **For Him** : Bring the gang to Giants Stadium or drink your way through Oakland’s best breweries.
  * **For Her** : Take the girls to the Korean Bathhouse or enjoy a Paint and Sip experience. 



## Best Party Ideas for a 40th Birthday Party

### 1\. Escape to the Islands…Kind Of

Head to the [Tonga Room and Hurricane Bar](https://www.fairmont-san-francisco.com/dine/tonga-room-hurricane-bar/) for fake thunderstorms and real (and really strong) mai tais and pina coladas. It’s fun to dance alongside the big crowd to the sounds of the live band, which floats on a tiki boat above the pool. And if you want a really memorable party, the Tonga Room can be rented out for private events. It may not be quite the same as renting out a private island for your 40th birthday, but it’s the closest you’ll get in San Francisco proper.

### 1\. Get Pampered with a Spa Experience

And not just any spa experience! If you’ve never been to a Korean Bathhouse, you are missing out. You can always expect to experience the most beautiful and well-maintained facilities and the best treatments. At [Pearl Spa](https://www.pearlspasf.com/blank-1), you can book a massage, scrub, and/or body wrap, but be sure to arrive much earlier. You need time to try out the steam room, dry sauna, hot tub, cold plunge, sitting and standing showers, Himalayan salt room, and red clay ball room. Every toxin and bit of tension in your body will seep out as you go from room to room chatting with your friends and enjoying the facilities. Bring all the girls for a full-day spa experience like no other!

## 2\. Keep it Classy with a Tea Party

Celebrate your 30th year with a tea party. It’s cute, quaint, and unique— if you’ve never done tea at the [Japanese Tea Garden](https://www.japaneseteagardensf.com/vist), it’s worth the experience. Spend the afternoon drinking Japanese tea accompanied by some Japanese sweets in a beautiful garden. It’s one of the more relaxing 30th birthday party ideas in San Francisco, and it’s certainly one of the most lush, as well. If you want a high tea experience, try the Fairmont’s Laurel Court. It’s a bit expensive, but it’s your birthday! Drink some soothing hot tea and enjoy some petit fours, tea sandwiches, scones, and more. Plus, toast to a new year with a glass of bubbly. Check out [this list](https://sf.eater.com/maps/best-afternoon-high-tea-san-francisco-bay-area) for other afternoon tea spots that will make you feel classier than the Queen.

### 3\. Sip some Wine while you Paint your Masterpiece

Paint and Sip classes are a lovely way to spend your birthday. [Paint the Town](https://paintthetown.com/party-packages/?utm_source=google_ads&utm_medium=ppc&utm_campaign=PTT_Onsite&utm_term=in%20person%20paint%20and%20sip&utm_adgroup=In%20Person_Phrase&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=12915136035&gbraid=0AAAAABjTo-ZBqybkRfxVRBUD8AbHlFzXX&gclid=CjwKCAjwtrXFBhBiEiwAEKen10YXEPbKqU0AstVMIWvZ4JtJpCkLkm4INW9i8FR6wUfaA7uDjhN9ghoCvQ8QAvD_BwE) offers private Paint and Sip classes and has many packages that can help you fit this experience into your party budget. They can also bring the supplies and instructor to you if you have a different venue in mind! Classes like these make party planning easy by getting you all the supplies, setting up the easels, and pouring the wine while you sit back and relax. But that doesn’t mean you can’t also DIY it! Head to your local Michaels and buy a few paint sets, packs of brushes, and some small canvases for everyone attending. Pair that with a few bottles of your favorite wine (or maybe more than a few), and a nice charcuterie board, and you have just created a night in that rivals any night out!

## 40th Birthday Party Ideas for Men

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20600'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screenshot-2025-08-31-at-12.29.31-AM-1024x600.png)Photo Credit: https://rusticales.com

### 1\. Take a Trip across the Bay for the Best Breweries

If you and your buds consider yourself beer aficionados (or at the very least, big fans of the drink), a bar crawl through the best breweries in the Bay Area might just be the perfect party idea! SF proper has a few good breweries, and if you want to stay local, we’ll point you right to House of Pizza (by Cellarmaker) in the Mission District. But true hop-heads know the best beer is in the East Bay, and it’s only a train ride away! Start at [Original Pattern Brewing](https://www.originalpatternbeer.com/), then walk to [Sante Adairius Rustic Ales](https://rusticales.com/), which is right next door to [Cellarmaker House of Pizza](https://cellarmakerbrewing.com/). After grabbing a few slices to sober up, pile into an Uber, and start heading towards the beach, hitting [Almanac Adventureland and Brewery](https://almanacbeer.com/) on the way, and ending the night at [Faction Brewing](https://www.factionbrewing.com/) with views of the Bay!

### 2\. Take the Boys Out to the Giants Game

If your birthday takes place between April and October, celebrate with the eight-time World Series champions, the San Francisco Giants! Games take place often, and there are different tiers of seating options. Book a box for you and your friends to hang out in, or get a bunch of bleacher seats and have your buddies meet you out behind center left field. Before the game, sip on beers and nosh on bar snacks at [Public House](http://www.publichousesf.com/) or [21st Amendment](http://21st-amendment.com/). After the game, go to [Momo’s](http://www.sfmomos.com/) to keep the party going.

### 3\. Celebrate with a nostalgic trip to the Arcade

You like games, but you don’t want to choose just one or two? [Emporium Arcade Bar](https://www.emporiumarcadebar.com/) has got you covered! This arcade bar has the largest collection of games in San Francisco. They also have generous drink and token packages for big parties that will keep you sufficiently liquored up and gaming for hours. So, whether you’re looking for classic arcade games, pool, or skeeball, you want it, they’ve got it. They also have a live DJ in case you want to boogie the night away in between games.

## Best Party Themes for an SF 30th Birthday Party

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20683'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/T1-pexels.com-stock-photo-1024x683.jpeg)Photo Credit: Pexel User Andrea Piacquadio

### 1\. Masquerade

All this theme requires is for your guests to don a glamorous or hilarious mask, put on their finest dresses and suits, and bring their dancing shoes! It’s a theme that balances being fancy with being quirky and giving guests room to play. The photo ops at a Masquerade party are countless and will be incredible keepsakes to look back on for years to come. This is a great theme if you are taking your friends to a venue with a dance floor, because looking around at a sea of people getting down to Pitbull while looking 18th-century chic is a highly entertaining experience!

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20585'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screenshot-2025-08-31-at-12.19.09-AM-1024x585.png)Photo Credit: Pexel User Nadin Sh

### 2\. Murder Mystery

This theme takes a little planning, but we promise it’s worth the extra effort! When you send out your birthday party invites, include in each a character description for what role your friends will be playing at your murder mystery theme party. You can keep it basic and assign them whether they’re a guest or the murderer, or you can create elaborate character profiles for everyone. Or it could be fun to base it on the game Clue and assign everyone a familiar character! No matter which route you go, a murder mystery theme is one of the most engrossing interactive party ideas that will keep your guests entertained for hours.

### 3\. Tropical

Bring Island vibes to your birthday party when you choose a Tropical theme! San Francisco has beautiful sunny days and gorgeous beaches, so why not take advantage and throw this party outside? A tiki bar is a great touch, as well as having a few tiki torches scattered about. Set up a blender so you can keep plying guests with icy drinks like piña coladas and daiquiris all night long. Dress code is bathing suits, and Hawaiian shirts—and grab a few packs of Leis from Party City for the finishing touch!

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20644'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/5.-Pexels.com-stock-images-1024x644.jpg)Photo Credit: Pexel User Drew Rae

### 4\. Casino

Turn your Home into a casino for one night only to celebrate your 40th birthday! All you need to do is set up a few fold-out tables, some packs of cards, poker chips, and keep the alcohol flowing. No real money needs to be involved to make this night a hit! You could either play with something like wrapped candy, start everyone out with about 25 pieces, and allow them to take home their winnings at the end of the night. Or give out 100 poker chips per person, and for every 50 each person has won/kept by the end of the party, give them one lottery ticket. End the party with a drawing to see who wins the silly or special items you pick out as prizes!

### 5\. Oscar Party

Embrace Hollywood Glamour with an Oscars-themed birthday party! Turn your home or venue of choice into a VIP Oscars afterparty for one night only. It doesn’t even have to coincide with Oscar’s season. This theme is all about dressing chic, embracing your cinephile side, and sipping your drink of choice out of champagne flutes (which can totally be plastic, we won’t tell). Put your favorite movie posters up on the wall, some old black and white film on the TV as set decoration, and roll out the red carpet for your guests to walk in on. Bonus points if you acquire a few of those life-size cardboard celebrities for hilarious photo ops with your guests!
