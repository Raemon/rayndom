Summary

This post features three Los Angeles group dining case studies from real client events—a team building tour, a client entertainment dinner, and last minute conference event—each hosted by the Avital team. 

Planning the perfect dinner for groups in Los Angeles can be a challenge—whether you’re hosting VIP clients, gathering your team together, or celebrating a birthday. You want something engaging, memorable, and seamlessly executed.

At Avital, we’re experts in [LA private dining](https://avitalexperiences.com/los-angeles/private-dining/) and believe traditional dinners are boring. That’s why we created the [Interactive Meal](https://avitalexperiences.com/experiences/los-angeles-interactive-meal/) and [unique food tours in Los Angles](https://avitalexperiences.com/los-angeles/). Not only are our experiences engaging, memorable, and seamless, but they’re a ton of fun! Below, we’ve highlighted three real-life scenarios where clients were looking for a group dining in Los Angeles, and how our team delivered great food & drink experiences for them.

## Dinner for Groups in Los Angeles, Explained.

### **What types of group dinners are available in Los Angeles**?

Los Angeles offers a huge variety of group dining options, from [private dining rooms at upscale restaurants](https://avitalexperiences.com/resources/restaurants-with-private-rooms-los-angeles/) to chef-led tasting menus and unique food tours. You can book anything from a rooftop dinner in Downtown LA to a guided progressive meal through Koreatown to [beachfront restaurants in Santa Monica](https://avitalexperiences.com/resources/restaurants-in-santa-monica-with-private-rooms/). Whether you’re planning a birthday party, team building event, or client dinner, there’s no shortage of ways to do dinner for groups in Los Angeles.

### **What should I consider when booking group dining in Los Angeles?**

When planning group dining in Los Angeles, consider the size of your group, dietary needs, and the atmosphere you’re going for—casual, celebratory, or professional. Many [restaurants have private or semi-private spaces for large groups](https://avitalexperiences.com/resources/restaurants-in-los-angeles-for-large-groups/), but they often require a group menu or minimum spend. For a smoother experience, look for venues that specialize in group events and offer things like preset menus, interactive elements, or event coordination.

### **Where can I find the best group dining Los Angeles has to offer?**

The best LA group dining options span the city. For trendy and interactive experiences, try West Hollywood or the Arts District. For more intimate, elevated dinners, Santa Monica and Beverly Hills are great bets. And if you’re looking for something fun and memorable, [LA food tours](https://avitalexperiences.com/los-angeles/walking-food-tours/) or our [Interactive Meal](https://avitalexperiences.com/experiences/los-angeles-interactive-meal/) can offer something totally unique. Booking early is key—popular spots fill up fast, especially for groups of 8 or more.

Use Case: Team Building

### **Challenge**

This small team of six initially reached out looking for an interactive private dining experience, but their budget was a bit tight for our Interactive Meal seeing as it was such a small group. 

### **Solution**

We introduced them to our new [Koreatown Food Tour](https://avitalexperiences.com/experiences/los-angeles-koreatown-food-tour/), which not only fit their budget better but offered a great opportunity for the guests to mix and mingle experience. To enhance the team building aspect, we included our signature team building games at no extra cost.

##### Koreatown Food Tour

Our Koreatown Food Tour is our newest tour in Los Angeles and visits the most densely populated and ethnically diverse neighborhood in all of Los Angeles.

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/penny-headshot-150x150.jpg)

##### Expert Host Penny

Penny, an expert Avital host in LA, had a great time at this client's event (Koreatown is one of her favorite neighborhoods in LA)! 

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Corporate-Team-Building-Food-Tours-Games-Upgrade-1-150x150.jpeg)

##### Team Building Games

Guests loved the additional (and complimentary) team building games – they got everyone talking and laughing without forced conversation. 

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Koreatown-Food-Tour-Birdseye-Korean-BBQ-2-150x150.jpg)

##### Menu for All Diets & Preferences

The tour visited three of the best restaurants in Koreatown, featuring dishes like Columbian/Korean arepas, traditional Korean BBQ (a group favorite), and passion fruit custard pie.

### **Results**

The group loved the tour! They were raving about the beef belly and how it was the perfect amount of food. Host Penny and the interactive games sparked laughter and conversation, turning a standard team dinner into a memorable bonding experience. A week later, the organizer told us, “This was _exactly_ what our team needed—fun, different, and just the right amount of structure.”

#### Client Rating: 7/7 – Client blown away, so thrilled! 

### **“Do order the beef belly!”**

I had such a blast with you in K-Town yesterday! Thank you for all your fabulous, #EmbraceQuirky stories — things we learned: Don’t play poker with Tabi. Don’t let Johnny borrow your car. Do order the beef belly!

## ****Case Study 2: Nativo**Client Entertainment Dinner****** , 15 Guests

Use Case: Client Entertainment

### **Challenge**

The client needed a venue close to their clients’ offices in Santa Monica, with private seating and an elevated vibe. Oh, and several guests had complex dietary restrictions to navigate. The event included both clients and sales team members (15 people total), so it had to strike a balance between professional and relaxed.

### **Solution**

We recommended our [Interactive Meal](https://avitalexperiences.com/experiences/los-angeles-interactive-meal/) at [Piccolo](https://www.piccolosantamonica.com/), one of our Classic restaurant partners. It’s a sophisticated spot in Santa Monica that could accommodate the group privately. Our team worked closely with the client to accommodate the range of dietary needs, from gluten-free to pescatarian, ensuring that every guest felt cared for.

##### Piccolo

This event was hosted at Piccolo, a beautiful Italian restaurant in Santa Monica and quick 10 minute walk from the client's office. 

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/penny-headshot-150x150.jpg)

##### Host Penny

Penny expertly facilitated the experience to ensure everything ran smoothly. She rocked the event and allowed the client to focus on their guests.

##### Engaging Activities

The cocktail making and the trivia were standout activities! They allowed our client to engage with their guests in a natural and fun way.

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sf-office-team-building-pasta-making-150x150.jpg)

##### Crowd-Pleasing Menu

Piccolo's menu was a true crowd-pleaser. The homemade pasta and roasted chicken were favorites! The menu also accommodated several guests' dietary restrictions.

### **Results**

The night was a success: intimate, polished, and full of flavor. The food and drinks were all crowd-pleasers and the interactive activities allowed for organic conversation and deeper connections between all guests. 

#### Client Rating: 7/7 – Client blown away, so thrilled!!

#### Host Rating: 6/7 – Great! Super smooth.

### **“I’m going to recommend you to my coworkers for future events in LA.”**

Thank you so much!! I’m going to recommend you to my coworkers for future events in LA and other markets we cover.

Use Case: Conference

### **Challenge**

With just one day’s notice, this team of ophthalmology professionals (visiting LA for a conference) wanted a memorable group dining experience while in town. The organizer reached out from South Dakota and needed something engaging, group-friendly, and within budget… fast.

### **Solution**

We sprang into action 🦸‍♀️ and recommended our [Interactive Meal](https://avitalexperiences.com/experiences/los-angeles-interactive-meal/), with two venue options within hours. The group ultimately chose [La Boheme in West Hollywood](https://avitalexperiences.com/resources/private-dining-west-hollywood/#8) for its warm ambiance and central location. We coordinated dietary needs, customized the menu, and added our signature Interactive Meal format, including fun hosted activities that encouraged connection.

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/la-boheme-private-dining-room-in-la-150x150.jpg)

##### La Boheme

This event was hosted at La Boheme, a romantic French restaurant in West Hollywood. They have a variety of private dining options for both big and small groups.

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/penny-headshot-150x150.jpg)

##### Host Penny

Once again, expert Host Penny facilitated this event and had a blast doing it. She connected with each guest individually as she led the activities. 

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/group-of-people-shaking-cocktails-during-private-dining-event-150x150.jpg)

##### Engaging Activities

The "smoky sips" cocktail making was definitely a highlight for the group. The food was also raved about! 

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/men-laughing-at-table-during-interactive-meal-150x150.jpg)

##### A la Carte Menu

La Boheme's french fusion menu is approachable yet elevated, featuring a fantastic Penne Pomodoro, pan seared salmon, and mushroom arancin. Plus is flexible for all dietary restrictions. 

### **Results**

Not only did we pull it off in 24 hours, but as excitement spread through the office, more guests were added mid-flight—literally! The event was a highlight of their LA trip, and several team members asked if we offer similar experiences in other cities. After the event Penny summarized the experience as “Great event. Warm friendly group. Great service. Amazing food.” What else could you ask for!? 

#### Client Rating: 6/7 – Amazing event, people were so happy!

#### Host Rating: 6/7 – Great! Super smooth. 

### **“Great event. Warm friendly group. Great service. Amazing food.”**
