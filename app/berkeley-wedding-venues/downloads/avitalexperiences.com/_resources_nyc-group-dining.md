## Group Dining Restaurants NYC 

Restaurants are a classic choice for group dining, offering a mix of convenience and atmosphere. It’s what most people think of when they think of group dining, and for good reason. You can choose the restaurant that best fits your group preferences and location, plus the restaurant does most of the heavy lifting. 

  * **Pros** : Wide variety of cuisines, pre-set group menus, professional service.
  * **Cons** : Limited flexibility for group activities, noise levels may vary.



### Restaurant Private Dining Options for Groups

In addition to selecting which restaurant you’d like, you also need to decide what style of dining you’d like, from a fully private room just for your group to a regular group reservation made online. Below is a high-level recap, but to see a full breakdown of the different private dining options, visit our [NYC private dining guide](https://avitalexperiences.com/new-york-city/private-dining/#private-dining-nyc-options).

**Private Dining Rooms NYC** : Fully enclosed spaces for privacy. Great for more formal events and celebrations, like impressing clients or milestone birthdays. 

**Semi-Private Spaces** : Partitioned areas offering some privacy. Great for intimate gatherings and casual events, like a quarterly team building event. 

**Group Reservations** : Regular table reservations for smaller groups. Great for casual dinners and meetups, like a family get-together.

[Avital’s Interactive Meal](https://avitalexperiences.com/experiences/new-york-city-interactive-meal/) takes place at the restaurant venue of your choice, from our vast network of partners (spoiler alert: they’re all fantastic!) You may be wondering why would I book a [NYC private dining room](https://avitalexperiences.com/resources/private-dining-room-nyc/) through Avital when I could just book with the restaurant directly? Great question! 

Booking an Interactive Meal with Avital isn’t just a regular old private dining room. Instead, in addition to a seated, 4-course meal with beverages, your Avital host will lead guests through three interactive foodie activities, like hands-on cocktails, foodie trivia, and flavor experiments. It’s your meal, it’s your activity, and it’s one of the best group dining options in NYC.

In the mood for Chinese food? This is one of our favorite Brooklyn spots and is perfect for groups that like to share because you’ll want to try everything. The menu at [Birds of a Feather](http://birdsofafeatherny.com/) is large enough for anyone in your party to find something they like and probably two to three things. Don’t leave without eating the soup dumplings (Crab Soup Buns) and Dan Dan Noodles which come in portions that are meant for groups.

If you’re in NoMad with no idea where to eat with your group, head to [Her Name is Han](http://www.hernameishan.com/). The “Korean soul food” spot will make you feel like you’re eating a home-cooked meal made by someone’s Korean mom. Despite it’s medium size, the restaurant takes reservations for up to 20 online so you’ll have plenty of mouths to split bulgogi hot pots, octopus fried rice, Kalguksu noodles, and bowls. The menu encourages sharing and reads, “Share a pot, ease your heart.” You’re also going to want to split the kiwi sowuju to please your heart and tastebuds.

Supper, from NYC restaurateur Frank Prisinzano, is Italian private dining at it’s finest. The rustic interior mirrors the rustic but absolutely perfect pastas with rich sauces, fresh selection of anitpasti, and other daily specials. For small groups, you can simply make a reservation in the main dining area. But medium groups looking for a slightly more upscale occasion may consider booking the private dining room.
