#  7 Team Building Icebreakers About Food And Why To Ask Them 

May 4, 2018 

On the thousands of tours we’ve given, we’ve found that everyone has something to share when it comes to food. That’s why we think that using team building icebreakers about food is a great way to get to know each other. Whether this is a group meeting for the first time or a group that already knows each other, these questions will easily prompt conversation. We gathered up our guides for their favorite food-related team building icebreakers.

## Why Ask Team Building Icebreakers About Food?

Food has an uncanny ability to bring people together, transcending cultural and social boundaries. When it comes to team building, using icebreakers centered around food can be a delightful and effective way to foster connections and collaboration. Sharing favorite recipes, culinary experiences, or even a friendly cook-off not only breaks the initial awkwardness but also promotes a sense of camaraderie. These icebreakers encourage colleagues to open up, showcase their creativity, and find common ground, all while savoring the universal pleasure of good food. 

[![10 Team Building Icebreakers About Food And Why To Ask Them: our guides always start with an ice breaker](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%202048%201363'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![10 Team Building Icebreakers About Food And Why To Ask Them: our guides always start with an ice breaker](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/04/Max-fletow.-Williamsburg-Food-Tour.-Avital-speaking-to-group-in-Black-and-white-standing-in-circle-for-introduction-at-Williamsburg-Hotel_preview.jpeg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/04/Max-fletow.-Williamsburg-Food-Tour.-Avital-speaking-to-group-in-Black-and-white-standing-in-circle-for-introduction-at-Williamsburg-Hotel_preview.jpeg)

## 1\. What’s the strangest thing you’ve ever eaten?

This question comes from long-time guide Corrine. It’s a question that gives you insight into someone’s life experiences. For instance, if someone shares that they ate llama in Peru or crickets in Thailand, you are able to gauge they’re adventurous. This also opens up the opportunity to ask about other travel this person has done or to share your own travel experiences. (Maybe you also ate crickets, but in Cambodia!)

## 2\. Share an unusual food pairing that you love.

We #EmbraceQuirky on our experiences, so there’s no shame in sharing your favorite odd food pairings-like popcorn and pickles. We bet there’s someone else in your group who also loves to pair unlikely duos. As C.S. Lewis said, “Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another: ‘What! You too? I thought I was the only one.” Sharing your quirky choices may be one of the fastest ways to break the ice and make a new friend.

## 3\. If you could only eat one food for the rest of your life, what would it be, and why?

This question helps you find out what’s important to someone. If they only eat protein shakes, it’s likely they lead a fit lifestyle. If they can’t live without cheese, they’re probably willing to share their favorite cheese shops in the city. Of course, this question is specific (and not realistic), but it lets you learn something real about a new person.

## 4\. What’s something that you ate regularly as a family growing up?

The answer to this question will help you get some insight into what someone’s childhood was like. Maybe they had working parents and survived on instant Ramen. Maybe their dad was a gourmet chef who made homemade pasta every Sunday. Or maybe they cooked dinner for their whole family from an early age. Whatever the answer is, you’ll be able to learn more about their background.

## 5\. What’s a food that you keep trying to like, but just can’t?

This question comes from our guide, Hana, who wants to like cilantro but can’t. So she asks this question to find out what other people are trying to learn to love. This question helps you learn about someone’s resiliency and dedication, even if it’s for something as small as [cilantro tasting like soap](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-does-cilantro-taste-bad-like-soap_n_7653808). Plus, there’s always easy bonding around foods you can’t stand.

## 6\. What’s your signature dish?

This question gives people permission to brag a little bit about something they’re good at. (And who doesn’t love to talk about something they’re good at?!) People will get to share the story about both what they make and how they learned to make their signature dish, as well as what prompted them to make it. (And maybe if the bonding goes well, they’ll make their signature dish for the group in the future.)

## 7\. If you could go to dinner anywhere tonight, where would you go?

This question lets people use their imagination and (on a small scale) helps people to share their dreams. Maybe they would transport to a pizza spot in Italy, or maybe they want to have their mom’s meatloaf for dinner. This is a low-pressure question because _anything_ can be the “right _”_ answer and the sky is the limit. This is also a great place for follow up questions. Perhaps someone in the group is going to Italy and wants the pizza recommendation, or wants mom’s meatloaf recipe.

## Final Thoughts on Team Building Icebreakers About Food

We’ve served up a delectable selection of steam building icebreakers about food, everyone’s favorite subject. These answers will range from silly to serious, and everyone will be able to share something. Each story will get your group to know each other a little bit better, from sharing personal food memories to swapping recipes, these activities are designed to create strong bonds among team members while indulging in the pleasures of good cuisine. So, if you’re looking to spice up your team-building efforts and ignite the spirit of collaboration, join us as we explore seven delightful ways to unite your team through the magic of food.
