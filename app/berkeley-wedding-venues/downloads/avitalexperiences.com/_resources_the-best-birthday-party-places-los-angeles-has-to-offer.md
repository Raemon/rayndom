#  The Best Birthday Party Places Los Angeles Has To Offer 

May 29, 2019 

Is your birthday coming up? Are you not sure what to do? Then let us help you with a list of the best birthday party places, in Los Angeles! Adulting is necessary, we get it, but having fun should be just as welcome into our lives. Los Angeles is filled with incredible venues, excellent food, and a plethora of things to do and see. After all, we are the entertainment capital of the world. So on your next big day, say goodbye to adulting and reserve a space at one of these awesome birthday party places Los Angeles has to offer!

## **For Active People: Highland Park Bowling[![](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/The-Best-Birthday-Party-Places-Los-Angeles-Has-To-Offer-bowling.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/The-Best-Birthday-Party-Places-Los-Angeles-Has-To-Offer-bowling.jpg) **

Established in 1927, during the prohibition era, [**Highland Park Bowling**](https://www.highlandparkbowl.com) gives bowling a whole new meaning. This vintage bowling alley is lined with comfy couches to relax in while you bowl, a fantastic cocktail bar, and a music room where weekly live shows are performed to accompany your bowling experience. Long gone are the days of bowling alleys with greasy pizza and cheap beer. Treat yourself to the Contadina, a handmade pizza topped with fresh herbs, feta cheese, and eggplant. Pair it with their Belle Of The Bowl, a cocktail made with honeydew-infused gin and cucumber-thyme soda. Call today to reserve a bowling lane and get the full birthday experience at this vintage 21 and up bowling alley. 

## **For Wine Lovers: Malibu Wines Safari**

## **[![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201003%20671'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/The-Best-Birthday-Party-Places-Los-Angeles-Has-To-Offer-wine-safari.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/The-Best-Birthday-Party-Places-Los-Angeles-Has-To-Offer-wine-safari.jpg)**

Thirty minutes outside of Los Angeles sits a beautiful open field with zebras, bison, camels, and a giraffe. Are we in a jungle? No, my friends. You’ve just walked into the [**Malibu Wines Safari**](https://www.lasafaris.com). Choose up to twenty of your closest friends and get ready for an adventure while a local guide takes you around in a custom-built open-air Safari vehicle through the Santa Monica Mountains. You will take frequent stops to visit and pet the exotic animals while enjoying two wine tastings! Choose the brunch tour and enjoy a full brunch spread or opt for the evening tour and end your day with wood-fire pizzas and seasonal salads. Either way, you’re drinking wine in a beautiful setting with exotic animals, you can’t go wrong.

## **For Music Lovers: The Blind Dragon**

## **[![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20970%20649'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/The-Best-Birthday-Party-Places-Los-Angeles-Has-To-Offer-music-.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/The-Best-Birthday-Party-Places-Los-Angeles-Has-To-Offer-music-.jpg)**

If there is one activity that guarantees belly laughs and life-long memories it’s karaoke. Los Angeles is sprawling with intimate, divey, and themed karaoke establishments, but for your big day we suggest [**The Blind Dragon**](http://blinddragon.com/los-angeles/contact-info/).  Located at the end of the Sunset Strip just before entering Beverly Hills, Blind Dragon is an Asian themed lounge with fancy tiki-themed cocktails, an excellent menu, and of course karaoke. Order the shrimp and pineapple fried rice that comes in an actual pineapple! Pair it with the Peary Godmother, a refreshing cocktail intertwined with kiwi, pear, and basil flavors. After dinner, head on over to your own private karaoke suite. Choose from over 25,000 songs and enjoy a complimentary bottle of champagne. Come at 8pm for an early night or embrace the late hours of your private karaoke suite and stay until 2am while you and your friends belt your heart out to some classics. 

## **For Morning People: Champagne Brunch Cruise**

## **[![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20940%20705'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/The-Best-Birthday-Party-Places-Los-Angeles-Has-To-Offer-champagne-cruise.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/The-Best-Birthday-Party-Places-Los-Angeles-Has-To-Offer-champagne-cruise.jpg)**

If you’re under the impression that swimming in the beach is the only water activity in Los Angeles, you have not been to Marina Del Rey. This seaside community is a major hot spot for water recreation, and is the largest man-made marina in North America. There is an abundance of water activities from sailing to paddle boarding and fishing, but for your birthday we suggest you celebrate with a bottomless champagne brunch on the [**Hornblower Cruise**](https://www.hornblower.com/port/overview/mdr+champagnebrunch_mdr). Enjoy a hearty breakfast buffet, dance on the stern to live jazz music and take in the gorgeous views of Southern California. This two-hour cruise is a magical way to celebrate your birthday and one you and your friends will never forget. 

## **For The Food Lovers – Food Tour in LA**

[![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20533'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/the-best-birthday-party-places-LA-Katie-Edwards.-Venice-Beach.-Guests-walking-by-Google-on-Street.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/the-best-birthday-party-places-LA-Katie-Edwards.-Venice-Beach.-Guests-walking-by-Google-on-Street.jpg)

If you are one of the many who classifies themselves as a foodie, then an Avital culinary tour is for you! Choose from one of three neighborhoods: Downtown, Korea Town, or Venice Beach and embark on a three-hour culinary tour of the city. A personal guide will lead you and your friends on a four-course meal through the city of your choice. [**Avital Tours**](http://avitaltours.com/los-angeles/about/) is more than an afternoon with delicious food and drink pairings; it’s a culinary experience. Gather around community tables while you learn the history of the city, the story behind your entrées, and go behind the scenes to meet the chefs and restaurant owners who created the dish in front of you. This storytelling-filled culinary experience will leave you feeling satisfied, educated, and enlightened. 

_Join us for a walking tour of Downtown Los Angeles or another neighborhood for one of the best_ _birthday party places Los Angeles has to offer_ _. We’ll take you on a food tour in_[ _Koreatown_](http://avitaltours.com/los-angeles/koreatown-food-tour) _,_[_Downtown_](http://avitaltours.com/los-angeles/tour/downtown-food-tour/) _, or_[ _Venice_](http://avitaltours.com/los-angeles/tour/venice-beach-food-tour/) _._
