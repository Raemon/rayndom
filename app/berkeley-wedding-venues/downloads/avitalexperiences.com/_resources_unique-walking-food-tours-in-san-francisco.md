[![ferry-building-in-sf](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![ferry-building-in-sf](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/walking-food-tour-sf-ferry-building.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/walking-food-tour-sf-ferry-building.jpg)

The Ferry Building on the waterfront, right next to downtown SF, was built all the way back in 1898 and has served as a hub of the city. Today, it still serves as a place to catch a ferry across the bay, but also houses some of the area’s most delicious eateries including Hog Island Oyster Co, chocolatiers, gourmet mushroom purveyors, the A16 outpost, and more. This tour takes about two hours and in that time you’ll learn about the history of the building and get the chance to taste delicacies from 10 or more businesses in the building. Choose to schedule your tour during the farmers market for more activity, or on a day when the market isn’t active so you have more time to see more establishments.

_Cost:_ $85 per person
