#  I’ve Tried Countless Virtual Team Building Games. Here Are 5 That Teams Like Best! 

August 5, 2020 

Virtual team building games are part of the routine now. I’m Jessica, Culinary Host with [Avital](http://avitaltours.com/virtual-happy-hour/), and I’ve done more Zoom happy hours than I’d like to admit, personally. And with that amount of…experience, comes a lot of knowledge on what works and doesn’t work when it comes to virtual team building games. So here are five games teams like the best based on many virtual events with many different types of teams. 

## **1\. Jackbox Party Games**

No one has ever had a bad time playing [Jackbox](https://www.jackboxgames.com/). It’s a little bit ridiculous, very silly, and super fun. Out of all of the virtual team building games out there, this one is guaranteed for the most laughs and engages everyone. Caution: It can get a little inappropriate at times, so make sure this is part of an after-work team building activity. And with that in mind, enjoy yourselves! There are multiple party packs to choose from for plenty of game options. You won’t run out of games to play with Jackbox! 

## **2\. Trivia Night**

It’s a classic game, and teams love it for a reason: competition and booze. I personally love when the categories are clever themes that combine pop culture and facts. The music round is an absolute must, too. You can opt to host, have different people on your team create categories, or hire a trivia host while you sit back and relax. It’s a low maintenance virtual team building game. All you need are some questions and a Zoom link! 

## **3\. Rose/Thorn Icebreaker**

Not so much a game as much as an icebreaker, the Rose/Thorn prompt is on my list because it gets people talking. Everyone has to go around and share their positives for the week, their rose. And then their thorn, or something negative. You can ask them to share something work-related or personal. It’s nice to hear what’s going on in your colleagues’ lives, especially when you’re calling in from different places. 

## **4\. Escape Room Virtual Adventures**

[Virtual escape rooms](https://theescapegame.com/remote-adventures/?utm_source=snacknation&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=virtual-team-building) are just as fun as the in-person ones. A host guides you over Zoom as you try to escape a virtual room by solving riddles and puzzles. The stakes are just as high as being in an escape room venue. It keeps everyone engaged, involves working together, and most importantly, is a lot of fun. 

## **5\. Photo Challenge**

I love using a photo challenge as one of my go-to virtual team building games. I think it’s one of the most creative ways to get your team to bond. Pick a theme or challenge for your team like “recreate your prom photo” or “take a picture of yourself doing an outdoor activity indoors.” Make sure to give your team enough time to complete the challenge and then marvel in the creativity. It will make people laugh, it will show off some photography skills, and it will keep the conversation flowing. It’s a lot of fun to see what people come up with!
