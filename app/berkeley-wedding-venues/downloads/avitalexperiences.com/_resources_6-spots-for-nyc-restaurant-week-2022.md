#  6 Foodie-Approved Spots to Eat During NYC Restaurant Week 2022 

July 25, 2022 

[NYC Restaurant Week 2022](https://www.nycgo.com/restaurant-week/) is coming up! Don’t get overwhelmed by all the options – we have a curated list of our six favorite restaurants to eat during this delectable time of year. 

But, what is restaurant week? Restaurant week is a period of time every year where restaurants in New York City create special pre-fixe menus to highlight what they do best. And? They usually come at reduced or fixed prices so they’re more accessible to the public! How great is that?

This year, NYC Restaurant Week 2022 lasts for 30 days to celebrate its 30th anniversary. From July 18 to August 21, the city is your oyster. Below we share our six favorite restaurants we think everyone should try during this delectable month. That means you can go to each of these restaurants every five days if you want to fit them all in! What a delicious month that would be… mmmmmm. 

But why pick just one a day? Below our restaurant picks we share a few food tours that allow you to try four different restaurants in one afternoon!

## 1\. The Russian Tea Room

The Russian Tea Room has been a part of New York’s Restaurant Week every year since the beginning in 1994. More impressively, it has been in continual operation for almost 100 years! Don’t miss a piece of this history with its classic Russian dishes and elegant interior.

**On the Menu:** The Russian Tea Room’s NYC Restaurant Week 2022 menu includes…

  * _Appetizer:_ Traditional Tea Room Borscht or Tea Room Salad
  * _Entrée:_ Boeuf à la Stroganoff, Côtelette à la Czar, Salmon, or Vegetable Wellington
  * _Dessert:_ Chocolate Mousse Cake or Traditional Cheesecake



**Price:** $60 per person, weekdays only

**Participating in Restaurant Week:** July 18 – August 21

[![kokomo-island-pasta-at-nyc-restaurant-week-2022](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![kokomo-island-pasta-at-nyc-restaurant-week-2022](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/07/kokomo-nyc-restaurant-week-2022.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/07/kokomo-nyc-restaurant-week-2022.jpg)Source: https://www.kokomonyc.com/

## 2\. Kokomo

Kokomo, in Williamsburg, serves up classic Caribbean favorites with a modern twist (including vegan options). Think flatbreads topped with jerk chicken or oxtail, roasted and stuffed sweet plantains, and don’t forget their intoxicating cocktails that come in every color of the rainbow. Their lively and vibrant atmosphere is reflected in their dishes and wait staff. If you want to e swept away into another world right in the city, we think Kokomo is the one for you. Reservations are highly encouraged – they’re really popular right now! And our favorite kind of bonus – their outdoor patio is puppy friendly.

**On the Menu:** Their NYC Restaurant Week 2022 menu includes…

  * Cocktail pairings for every course (_optional)_
  * _Appetizer:_ Coconut Curry Mussels, Seafood Cake, or Roasted Stuffed Sweet Plantains


  * _Entrée:_ Red Peppa Jerk Chicken, Lentil Meatballs, or Koko’s Island Pasta
  * _Dessert:_ Bread Pudding, Assorted Cheesecakes, or Assorted Ice Cream



**Price:** $45 for dinner; weekdays only

**Participating in Restaurant Week:** July 18 – August 21

### [![fresh-pasta-being-made-by-hand](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![fresh-pasta-being-made-by-hand](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/07/pasta-at-giocanda-nyc-resturant-week-2022.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/07/pasta-at-giocanda-nyc-resturant-week-2022.jpg)

## 3\. La Gioconda

The team at La Giocanda, the Italian name for Da Vinci’s Mona Lisa, likes to think of their establishment as a “Temple to of Renaissance Cuisine.” They’re known for combining incredibly authentic Italian fare while also showing its guests a modern take on what Italian food can be. Dine al fresco at their parklet lining the sidewalk and watch the people walk by. We definitely recommend getting a bottle from their massive wine collection – that we’ve heard is very well priced!

**On the Menu:** Their NYC Restaurant Week 2022 menu includes a wide array of options. Dishes like mozzarella di bufala, veal meatballs, various pastas, saltimbocca, and tantalizing desserts. This is incredibly generous as most restaurants give you limited choices as to what dishes you can choose. Click [here](https://www.lagiocondanyc.com/restaurant-week) to view the full menu.

**Price:** $45 dinner and $30 lunch; weekdays only

**Participating in Restaurant Week:** July 18 – August 21

## 4\. City Cruises by Hornblower

Departing from Pier 15 in New York, this experience is quite different than most restaurant week options. This brunch is hosted on a Hornblower cruise boat that takes you on the East and Hudson Rivers while you see the iconic skyline of the Big Apple. While you enjoy your cruise experience you also get to brunch on a delicious, first class buffet with unlimited non alcoholic beverages and bottomless mimosas too!

  * So much more!

## 5\. Dowling’s at the Carlyle

We think that Dowling’s is one of the more exciting new restaurants to open post-pandemic. Think reinvented and elevated American classics all served by extremely professional staff. When you walk inside it absolutely feels like you’re dining at your fancy, rich aunt’s parlor with roaring fireplaces, eclectic, antique furniture, and art lining the walls. Let Chef Sylvian Delpique sweep you away to a bygone era with long forgotten classics paired with resplendent cocktails and wine selection.

**On the Menu:** Their NYC Restaurant Week 2022 dinner menu includes…

  * _Appetizer:_ Gazpacho, the Wedge, Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail, or Pâté en Croûte 
  * _Main Course_ : Heirloom Quinoa and Zucchini, Murray’s Roasted Half Chicken, Shrimp Scampi, or Steak Frites
  * Ice Cream Sundae or New York Cheesecake



**Price:** $45 lunch; $65 dinner

## 6\. Beauty & Essex

This hip restaurant on the Lower East Side of Manhattan sincerely focuses on the diner’s whole experience, from the floor to the ceiling, from the plate to the belly. As their website reads it all starts when you walk through their entrance, “a well ­curated modern day pawn shop replete with … quirky artifacts, vintage treasures and an eclectic array of “one­off” pieces of jewelry. Continuing past the pawn shop, guests encounter a grand, circular staircase wrapped around a two-­story custom chandelier…” and into the dining rooms to eat. Their food is pioneered by Chef Chris Santos (he’s one of the chefs that made the small share plate trend popular), who you can trust to treat you to a deliciously cool time. 

**On the Menu:** Their NYC Restaurant Week 2022 menu includes…

  * _First Course:_ Tuna Poke Tacos, Avocado Toast, “Chicken” Arepa, or Summer Squash Pizza
  * _Second Course:_ Spaghettini, Peruvian Chicken, Grilled Atlantic Salmon, or Braised Short Ribs
  * _Third Course:_ Brownie Sundae, Selection of Ice Creams and Sorbets, “Les, NYC” Doughnuts



**Price:** $60 per person for dinner

If you don’t want to eat at just one restaurant in one day, we suggest you try a progressive meal tour. This way you can eat at four different restaurants in one afternoon! A progressive meal tour will take you to multiple iconic New York restaurants to eat a different course at each restaurant, so you don’t have to pick just one.

We love this idea because you get a wide array of foods from different iconic New York restaurants in a short amount of time – really savoring what the NYC Restaurant Week 2022 has to offer.

## Michelin Starred Progressive Meal

We suggest the Michelin Star Progressive Meal if you want the most elegant progressive meal possible. You can even upgrade your experience and receive a luxury car to pick you up for your evening with a gift waiting inside for you. On this tour you will eat food created by some of the top chefs in the world while receiving 5 star hospitality from your veteran guide. We especially like this option, not only to try more than one restaurant at a time, but also for the history and stories you’ll hear from your experienced Avital guide. 

Click [here](https://avitalexperiences.com/experiences/new-york-city-michelin-food-tour/) to learn more about how you can try restaurants like Tuome, Junoon, Casa Mono, ZZ’s Clam Bar, Le Coucou, NoMad, Atomix and many more.

## East Village Food Tour

If you like the sound of a progressive meal tour but you’d rather it focus on a particular neighborhood of New York, we suggest trying Avital Tours’ East Village Food Tour. You’ll get to try some more laid back eats compared to our Michelin Star tour, and you’ll get to learn more specifically about the East Village and its artistic, punky, and grungy past. On top of that, you’ll get to try some amazing international cuisines because the East Village is a melting pot of immigrant cultures that create a lively and diverse restaurant scene.

Well, good luck on your food journey you culinary traveler! Whether you choose just one, or all of them, you won’t regret trying any of our picks for NYC Restaurant Week 2022.
