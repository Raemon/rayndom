## Tips for Organizing Team Building Activities 

  * **Come in with a Plan:** A little bit of structure goes a long way! Map out the order of activities you want to accomplish with time estimates beforehand.
  * **Keep it Inclusive:** Pick activities that cater to all skill and ability levels. And don’t forget about dietary restrictions if serving food or drink. This is meant to bring your team closer, not single anyone out.
  * **Don’t Forget the Group Photo:** You’re going to want to remember this day! Make sure to get some pictures.
  * **Pick teams at random** : If the activity involves teams, find a random way to generate them rather than having people pick their own teams. This prevents anyone from being left out or “picked last”.
  * **Plan Opening and Closing Remarks** : It can be helpful to start the activity with an explanation of why it was chosen, and end it with a reflection on what your team members gained from the experience.



## Why Team Building Activities Matter

There are a surprising number of team building activities for adults that are proven to enhance productivity and communication in your workplace. [Group Dynamix](https://groupdynamix.com/about-us/), a team-building experience company whose been innovating the field since 1998, has found that: 

“Recent industry analysis reveals that companies with robust team-building programs can achieve extraordinary returns. One documented case study showed a 7.5x return on investment through a layered program that included nature immersion, somatic learning, and conscious communication activities. The tracked outcomes included 25% improvement in retention, 5.6% increase in productivity, 29.5% reduction in stress, and 9.5% improvement in collaboration.” 

Clearly, incorporating these activities into the work day, week, or at the end of the quarter is worth it!
