### Take a Koreatown Food Tour

Los Angeles is a great city for foodies, and a food tour is the perfect way to explore with your group this holiday season. Our [Koreatown Food Tour](https://avitalexperiences.com/experiences/los-angeles-koreatown-food-tour/) is new, fresh, and incredibly delicious. ‘Tis the season to indulge, and there is no shortage of decadent food on this tour.

### Build Charcuterie Chalets

We’re sure you’ve heard of gingerbread houses, but what about a Charcuterie Chalet? Charcuterie Chalets are grown-up gingerbread houses made from ingredients typically found on a meat and cheese board. Like cracker walls, salami shingles, and parmesan snow! There are a few different ways you can enjoy this experience:

### Take a Private Yacht Tour

What could be more elegant than a gorgeous holiday party taking place on a yacht that sails you and your colleagues around the bay? It’s a perfect venue for a holiday party! Take advantage of this great idea and organize a yacht tour with [City Cruises Luxury Yacht](https://www.cityexperiences.com/blog/host-corporate-holiday-party-los-angeles/).

Plus, City Cruises makes planning easy by providing packages for catering, bar options, entertainment, decor, and meal service, and working with you to build the holiday event of your dreams!

### See a Holiday Lights Show

One of the most remarkable things about the holiday season to a child is the dazzling light displays adorning their neighborhood. DTLA delivers on that nostalgic experience in an elevated way that makes it thrilling for adults as well. A group of LA-based artists and engineers have come together to create the most epic holiday light show of all time! 

If you want a more low-key holiday party for your team, you can choose to attend the Grand Illumination’s Holiday Light Show together in Downtown LA, then join together at a local watering hole or restaurant afterwards for snacks and drinks to finish off the evening. Bonus points if you all wear ugly holiday sweaters to get into the festive spirit! 

**Why we love it:** This is one of our most low-maintenance Los Angeles corporate holiday party ideas _and_ includes festive sights and great photo ops.

![group ice skating in downtown la for corporate holiday party](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20695%201024'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![group ice skating in downtown la for corporate holiday party](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/holidayicerinkdowntownla-695x1024.jpg)Image Credit: holidayicerinkdowntownla.com

### Go Ice Skating

Nothing rings in the holiday season quite like an outdoor ice skating rink. It’s a classic Holiday event for a reason! The Holiday Ice Skating Rink in Pershing Square is a recurring event every holiday season, and, amazingly, they’re available to [rent out for corporate events](https://holidayicerinkdowntownla.com/corporate-events/). So lace up your skates, put on your scarf, get out on the ice, and organize a holiday party your team will never forget. Host your Los Angeles corporate holiday party at The Pershing Square ice skating rink for an unforgettable festive experience! 

**Why we love it:** This is a quintessential holiday excursion that you can share with your team.

![Nuart Theatre in los angeles](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20859'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Nuart Theatre in los angeles](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/@nuarttheatre-1024x859.jpg)Image Credit: @nuarttheatre

### View Holiday Film Screening

If you and your team are located in LA or visiting for the holiday season, we can almost guarantee there are cinephiles in your group who would appreciate a private movie theater experience. The Landmark Nuart Theater is a swanky single-screen theater available to be rented out to play any movie you desire. 

There are many iconic holiday movies to choose from, but to get you started, some of our favorites are: Home Alone, Nightmare Before Christmas, Gremlins, and Elf. We think these screenings are best suited to festive comedies to keep it fun. The Landmark Nuart Theater also sells beer and wine along with all the expected movie theater concessions, so it will still feel like a party!

**Why we love it:** Who doesn’t love the experience of going to the cinema? Bring it to your team and let them sit back, relax, and immerse themselves in the film of your choosing.

![group in front of la food bank, a great corporate holiday party idea in los angeles](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20683'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![group in front of la food bank, a great corporate holiday party idea in los angeles](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/lafoodbank.jpg)Image Credit: lafoodbank.org

### Volunteer at a Food Bank

This holiday season, have your team give back to those who need it most. Before the pandemic, one in five residents were at risk for hunger, and now the need is even greater. The [Los Angeles Regional Food Bank](https://www.lafoodbank.org/volunteer/) is an amazing organization whose vision is that “no one goes hungry in Los Angeles County.” Contact them directly to coordinate how to create the most helpful experience for you and your colleagues.

**Why we love it:** Giving back to the community is what the holidays are all about – this is a great way to team build while helping your neighbors.

### Solve a Murder Mystery Dinner

While a _festive_ murder mystery may sound counterintuitive, it is, in actuality, an awesomely engaging option for a [holiday party for your team](https://www.murdermysteryco.com/murder-mystery-party/). People get really into it, and gameplay can go on for hours depending on your team’s investment in the story! We suggest you encourage your group to dress up according to the theme you choose. The actors and event hosts will be dressed to the nines and will be in character the entire time to help to immerse everyone attending the party. And the best part? They come to any venue of your choosing!

**Why we love it:** Break out of the mold and get your team engaged in a fun role-playing game that will have them entertained for hours.

![the nutcracker performance at los angeles ballet](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20822'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![the nutcracker performance at los angeles ballet](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/losangelesballet-1024x822.jpg)Image Credit: losangelesballet.org

### Watch The Nutcracker

The Nutcracker has been enchanting audiences since its first performance in 1892. Treat your team to an exceptional piece of art and get them all tickets to see the Nutcracker performed by the [Los Angeles Ballet](https://www.losangelesballet.org/2024-2025-season/the-nutcracker). We think it’s the classiest of our Los Angeles corporate holiday party ideas because it immerses your team in the height of culture at one of the most iconic Los Angelian institutions. This ballet is such a classic that it is nearly ubiquitously performed every year during the holiday season by ballet companies.

**Why we love it:** It gives your holiday celebration a more refined edge without the need for constant socializing – perfect for art lovers and introverts!

![gift exchange in the office for work holiday party](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20900%20700'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![gift exchange in the office for work holiday party](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/gift-exchange-in-the-office-for-work-holiday-party.jpg)

### Exchange White Elephant Gifts

The [White Elephant Game](https://www.whiteelephantrules.com/) is such a raucous good time that most people assume it’s a contemporary invention. In actuality, it is a long-storied tradition that has been passed around for over a hundred years now. Something with that kind of staying power has to be a hit! 

For this game, everyone brings a gift to the party (or you can provide them if you wish). This is particularly fun if there are some “great” gifts and some “bad” gifts. One at a time, people will open a gift. As you go along, each subsequent person can choose to open an unopened gift or steal a gift that has already been opened. We may not personally know your team, but we know that with this game, a load of bargaining, light-hearted competition, and fun will commence.

**Why we love it:** This fun and sometimes heated game will bring your team closer together without the need to go off-site.

![two women wearing santa hats and playing holiday trivia](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![two women wearing santa hats and playing holiday trivia](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/corporate-holiday-parties-nyc-movie-and-trivia.jpg)

### Compete with Holiday Movie Trivia

This is a cozy DIY movie screening that won’t break the bank. First, pick a classic festive movie that everyone will enjoy. We suggest you set up a poll and give a couple of options, and see which movie wins! This is a great option for a remote or in-person event, or a mix depending on your team and their needs! 

You can use an online service to set up a watch party so that people watching from home can join in live. Then, you can set up a screening party at the office for those who want to join in person. Provide snacks and drinks, or even do a potluck if you think the crew would be into it! Finally, round it all off with a holiday movie trivia game – we suggest making an intermission in the middle of the movie to create some social time.

**Why we love it:** This is a super flexible event that can accommodate teammates who want to join in person as well as those who are remote!

![avital hosts standing in front of holiday interactive bar](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201013%20788'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![avital hosts standing in front of holiday interactive bar](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/avital-hosts-standing-in-front-of-holiday-interactive-bar.jpg)

### Make Your Own Spiced Holiday Nuts

Your expert hosts will guide your guests through crafting a delicious spiced nut mix in this creative interactive bar experience. Everyone will leave with a cute branded pouch full of their delicious, nutty, sweet, and spicy creation.

**Why we love it:** Festive, unique, and classy with a beautiful take-home gift.

### Roast Savory S’mores

For the ultimate cozy vibes, host a [savory s’smores](https://themodernnonna.com/savory-smores/) station, complete with crackers, cheese, meats, and delicious toppings like hot honey and fig jam. Guests will choose all of their ingredients at the buffet table, then head outside where they’ll find portable, table-top fires to roast their cheese over open flame. Note that the venue must allow open flame either inside or outside to host this event. 

**Why we love it:** A cozy activity that will surprise and delight guests.

## Corporate Holiday Party FAQs

What is a Los Angeles corporate holiday party? 

A [Los Angeles Company Holiday Party](https://avitalexperiences.com/seasonal-experiences/corporate-holiday-party/) is for colleagues who work together in Los Angeles, or who are visiting LA during the holiday season for an event, retreat, or conference, and want to get into the holiday spirit while in town. We happen to think a holiday party doesn’t even have to be holiday-themed, but just has to coincide with the holiday season. It’s a great way to celebrate your peers and provide a merry send-off before heading off to personal holiday gatherings and events. 

We’ve compiled corporate holiday party entertainment ideas that span the breadth of many different budgets, so you can choose to go all out or to rein in the spending! 

What to wear to a corporate holiday party? 

Dressing for a corporate holiday party typically requires finding a balance between festive and professional. The specific dress code can depend on the event’s venue and time of day, so check for any guidelines from the organizers. Here are a few options based on common dress codes:

  * **Business Casual** : Choose something polished but comfortable, like a nice sweater with tailored pants, or a blouse and skirt combo. Stick to festive colors or add a holiday accessory to keep it seasonal without going overboard.
  * **Formal or Semi-Formal** : For evening events at upscale venues, opt for cocktail attire. Men could wear a suit or a jacket and slacks, while women might choose a cocktail dress or a nice jumpsuit. A touch of holiday sparkle in accessories can add a seasonal touch without being too flashy.
  * **Themed Attire** : Some parties may have a specific theme, like “Ugly Sweater” or “Winter Wonderland,” allowing for more creative or casual choices. In this case, embrace the theme to add to the holiday spirit, but remember it’s still a work function, so keep it tasteful.



Ultimately, choose an outfit that aligns with both the event’s setting and your comfort level, while reflecting a bit of holiday cheer.

When to have a corporate holiday party? 

Timing your holiday party can greatly impact attendance and engagement. Here are a few considerations:

  * **During Office Hours vs. After Hours** : For an onsite holiday luncheon or low-key celebration, holding the event during work hours ensures higher participation. For a more social evening event, after-hours on a Friday may be more fitting, allowing employees to fully unwind without workday responsibilities.
  * **Weekday vs. Weekend** : Mid-week events tend to have higher attendance, as weekends are often reserved for family time. Fridays work well for evening events, as people are typically more relaxed heading into the weekend.
  * **Holiday Season Window** : Aim for early to mid-December if possible, before employees start taking time off for personal holiday plans. Avoid the days right before major holidays when attendance might be lower.



Ultimately, select a date and time that allows your team to participate comfortably and enjoyably.

Where to have a corporate holiday party in LA? 

Choosing a venue that aligns with your party goals and fits your team’s size and preferences is essential. Here are popular options:

  * **Onsite at the Office** : Hosting an office party is cost-effective and convenient, particularly for daytime events. With a bit of decoration and a catered meal, you can transform the office into a festive space.
  * **Local Restaurant or Bar** : Reserving a private room or section in a restaurant or bar offers a lively atmosphere without the need for set-up or clean-up. It’s a popular choice for smaller teams or departments.
  * **Special Event Venues** : For a larger team or more formal event, consider event spaces like banquet halls, hotels, or unique venues like art galleries or breweries. These options allow for a customizable experience and often provide catering options as well.
  * **Outdoor Settings** : In LA, you can get away with an outdoor holiday gathering at a patio or rooftop venue. This can offer a unique twist and a festive, open-air experience.



Choosing the right location helps set the tone of the party, whether you want a cozy get-together, a professional dinner, or a lively celebration.
