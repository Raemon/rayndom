#  Food-Themed Team Building Icebreakers 

May 11, 2018 

We don’t know anyone who doesn’t love to talk about food. We’re eating enthusiasts who surround ourselves with other food lovers. On the thousands of tours we’ve given, we’ve found that everyone has something to share when it comes to eating. That’s why we think that food-themed team building icebreakers are a great way to get a group to know each other. Here are some ideas to implement at work, with a new team, in big groups, or even among new friends.

## Food Story Share

[![Get to know eachother with these food-themed Team Building Icebreakers](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Team-Building-Icebreakers-team-bonding.jpeg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Team-Building-Icebreakers-team-bonding.jpeg)

Let’s start with something simple. For a quick get-to-know-you activity, have everyone in the group share a fun food fact. Here are some prompts to get you going:

  * What’s the strangest thing you’ve ever eaten?
  * What’s something that you ate regularly as a family?
  * Share an unusual food pairing that you love-like pickles and peanut butter.
  * If you could only eat one food for the rest of your life, what would it be?



These answers will range from silly to serious, but everyone will be able to share something, and each story will get your group to know each other a little bit better.

## Get-To-Know-You Pot Luck

[![have a pot luck: Team Building Icebreakers](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%202048%201365'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![have a pot luck: Team Building Icebreakers](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/34799409053_392843f188_k.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/34799409053_392843f188_k.jpg)

A great way to break the ice is by eating together. If you have a group of people who like to cook, host a Pot Luck-a meal in which each of the guests contributes a dish. Encourage people to make something that has meaning to them so they can share both their dish and the story behind it. Have people share their stories aloud or have a template for a sign so people can leave it next to their dish. Here are some prompts for your potluck display sign.

  * Cook’s name:
  * I made _______________.
  * Ingredients _____________.
  * The story behind this dish is _______________.



## Food Tour

[![book a food tour for part of Food-Themed Team Building Icebreakers](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%202200%201467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![book a food tour for part of Food-Themed Team Building Icebreakers](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Katie-Edwards.-Venice-Beach.-Guests-cheersing-with-wine-at-Plant-Food-and-Wine.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/04/Katie-Edwards.-Venice-Beach.-Guests-cheersing-with-wine-at-Plant-Food-and-Wine.jpg)

If your group doesn’t want to cook but still wants to eat, a great place to break the ice is on a food tour. During this culinary experience, your group will have a chance to learn about each other during a four-course progressive meal that takes place at four restaurants. Guides are trained to help guests learn new food facts both about restaurants and each other. You’ll engage in some icebreakers while tasting local food, wine, and cocktails.

_Want to join Avital Tours for team building icebreakers and a culinary experience? Whether your group size is as small as 8 people or as large as 350 people, we have a culinary experience for you! Please send us an email to[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) to inquire about culinary hands-on corporate team building activities._
