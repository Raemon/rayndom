#  15 Unusual Office Team Building Activities in NYC 

May 13, 2022 

## What Are Office Team Building Activities?

At Avital: we create innovative and fun office team building activities that foster social connection through food + drink! Our team has worked long and hard to adapt to the social awkwardness COVID has left in its wake, while also keeping our activities fresh and unique.

Each of the experiences below are intended to be done in the office with the help of delivered kits and/or a virtual guide. These additions make organization and operation a breeze!

## Why are Office Team Building Activities Important?

As of 2021, about 64% of companies have planned for a physical return to work. On the one hand, the return to the office looms large for too many employees who have gotten used to the ease and comfort of home. On the other hand, there is an entire web of office workers who are hungry for a return to work; eager to re-establish their office space, and take lunch breaks with their beloved coworkers. And then there are all of the new hires who have never even been to the office!

It is undeniable that company morale relies on the smooth transition of all of these employees back into their shared work environment. And what better way to instill a fun and relaxed ambiance than with a quirky office team building activity to get everyone back to a comfortable groove?

## ![man doing water tasting during unusual office team building](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![man doing water tasting during unusual office team building](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/05/unusual-office-team-building-water-tasting.jpg)

## 1\. Discover How Much There is to Learn About Your Palette with a Water Tasting!

A [Water Tasting](https://avitaltours.com/virtual-water-tasting/)–not dissimilar from a wine tasting–is perhaps a little unheard of, though significantly more appropriate for the office! In this exciting new activity Avital: has created, we are eager to execute an office team building activity that teaches each individual so much about water and by extension, the human palate.

  * Time: 60 minutes (to accommodate the work day)
  * What’s included: 5 Premium Waters in 750ml Glass Bottles (2 Still, 2 Sparkling), 2 Delicious Food Pairings, 1 Water Test Strip
  * What We Do: Through a progressive series of tastings, all would be invited to explore both sensations on their palate, and more about their colleagues who are along for the ride! We have a certified sommelier lead the event so that everyone can sit back, eat, drink, and enjoy!

## 2\. Who’s Up for a Tongue Twister?

Sometimes big words can tie our tongues into a knot, other times it is a taste–typically a sour one!–that can twist our tongues all around! In the Avital: [Tongue Twister Tasting](https://avitaltours.com/virtual-tongue-twister-tasting), we want to invite you to an office team building activity that will not only bring everyone closer, but also take your team on an experience so delightful and delicious, no one will be able to hold back!

This is one of the many office team building activities where employees are given an opportunity to talk with one another and share what they have learned–and it is sure to get some laughs and conversation flowing.
