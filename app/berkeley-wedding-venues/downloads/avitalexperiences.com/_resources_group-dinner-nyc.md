#  Best Group Dinner NYC: 3 Real Client Case Studies 

February 12, 2025 

Summary

This post features three NYC group dinner case studies from real client events—a surprise birthday, a corporate holiday party, and a client entertainment experience—each hosted as an Interactive Meal with Avital in NYC. 

Planning the perfect group dinner NYC can be a challenge—whether you’re celebrating a special occasion, organizing a team building event, or hosting a client dinner. You want something engaging, memorable, and seamlessly executed.

At Avital, we’re experts in [NYC private dining](https://avitalexperiences.com/new-york-city/private-dining/) and believe traditional dinners are boring. That’s why we created the [Interactive Meal](https://avitalexperiences.com/experiences/new-york-city-interactive-meal/). Not only is it engaging, memorable, and seamless, but it’s a ton of fun! Below, we’ve highlighted three real-life scenarios where clients were looking for a group dinner in NYC, and how our Interactive Meal delivered a great experience for them. 

## Table of Contents

## What is an Interactive Meal?

Client: Heather at Google

Use Case: Team Building, Company Holiday Party

### **Challenge**

Since colleagues’ partners were also attending the holiday party and not everyone knew one another, Heather wanted an event that would encourage people to talk to each other, even if they had never met. But she wanted it to be classy and not too structured.

### **Solution**

Our Sales Manager, Noelle, worked with the client to build an incredible holiday party for their team at [Il Fiorista](https://www.ilfioristanyc.com/), one of the best group dinner restaurants NYC has to offer. Il Fiorista is one of our Premium Partners making it a perfect fit for this group—classy for a holiday party but still relaxed for a team gathering.  
  
The event’s expert host, Freddy, led the group through the hands-on activities and kept the conversation flowing naturally. He also facilitated with the restaurant staff to be sure all the food and drink was served on time with all dietary restrictions accommodated.

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Il-Fiorista-NYC-Flatiron-District-Restaurant-interior-150x150.png)

##### Il Fiorista Restaurant Venue

Premium Partner 

The client chose Il Fiorista, a Michelin Plate Recommended Italian restaurant in Flatiron, for their group dinner experience. A fantastic choice for special team gatherings. 

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/freddy-avital-host-150x150.jpg)

##### Expert Host Freddy

Freddy, an expert Avital host in NYC, had a fantastic time at this client's event. He praised the Il Fiorista staff for being so on top of everything and super communicative. 

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/men-eating-prize-money-during-private-dining-team-building-150x150.jpg)

##### Conversation-Starting Activities

Guests loved all of the activities, but had so much fun with the trivia and the edible cash prizes! They also loved bellying up to the bar to craft the "Thorn in My Side" tequila cocktail alongside the expert bartender. 

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/housemade-papardelle-from-il-fiorista-1-150x150.jpg)

##### Menu for All Diets & Preferences

The event featured a delicious, Italian-inspired menu. A few highlight dishes included Lavender Pappardelle, Roasted Salmon, and a NY Strip Steak. There were 12 guests with dietary restrictions and all were accommodated, including vegan, kosher, no dairy, no seeds, and more. 

### **Results**

At the end of all of our events we ask both the client and host to rate the experience on a 7-point scale so we can continuously improve all aspects of our experiences. Overall this was an incredible event with happy guests and a happy client. We’re looking forward to hosting more events for Heather and her team in NYC. 

#### Client Rating: 6/7 – Amazing event! People were so happy! 

#### Host Rating: 6/7 – Great! Super smooth.

### **“I felt like I totally nailed the holiday party this year.”**

I love how much fun everyone had! The organized activities got everyone talking and interacting, but it didn’t feel forced or unnatural. Freddy did a fantastic job keeping the event running smoothly. Everyone had a blast. I felt like I totally nailed the holiday party this year.

## ****Case Study 2: TD**Synnex’s Client Entertainment Dinner****** , 62 Guests

Client: Alaina at TD Synnex

Headcount: 62 Guests

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2040%2040'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/food-icon.svg)

Use Case: Client Entertainment

### **Challenge**

Alaina needed a unique experience for a large group of Synnex’s VIP clients. She wanted something interactive but still elegant, with enough time for networking and conversation even with such a large group. Oh, and it needed to be within walking distance from the Hilton in Midtown. 

### **Solution**

Our team organized an Interactive Meal for Alaina and her large group at [Blue Fin](https://www.bluefinnyc.com/), one of Avital’s Premium restaurant partners. Blue Fin has a sleek, modern interior but still feels very fun and approachable. Their menu features fresh, simple surf and turf making it a crowd-pleaser for large groups.   
  
With such a large group we included two expert Avital hosts to help facilitate. Yasmin and Freddy are two of our best NYC hosts and did a fantastic job facilitating the experience. They handled all of the details so Alaina and Synnex’s staff could simple enjoy the event and connect with their clients.

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2024-05-06-at-3.23.43-PM-150x150.png)

##### Blue Fin Restaurant Venue

Premium Partner 

This event was hosted at Blue Fin, a beautifully designed, nautical restaurant in heart of Midtown and quick 10 minute walk from the Hilton. 

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/freddy-and-yasmin-avital-group-dinner-nyc-hosts-150x150.jpg)

##### Expert Hosts Yasmin & Freddy

Because this was such a large group we had two expert Avital hosts facilitating the experience to ensure everything ran smoothly. Freddy and Yasmin rocked the event and allowed the client to focus on their guests. 

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nyc-clients-making-cocktails-during-entertainment-event-150x150.jpg)

##### Activities for Large Groups

All of our hands-on activities are just as fun with a large group as they are with a small group. The hands-on cocktail making was a hit for Synnex guests, where they got hands-on to craft The Great Escape—winner of the 2022 Margarita Rumble! 

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/plate-of-steak-on-table-150x150.jpg)

##### Crowd-Pleasing Menu

Blue Fin's surf and turf menu was a true crowd-pleaser. The fresh market salmon and the filet mignon were standout dishes. The menu also accommodated several guests' dietary restrictions including a shellfish allergy and gluten free. 

### **Results**

Alaina and her group were so pleased with the event and felt like they were really able to connect with their clients in a new way. The every was seamless and fun was had by all. 

#### Client Rating: 5/7 – Above average event! Very satisfied! 

#### Host Rating: 5/7 – Above average event! Mostly smooth sailing.

### **“I actually got to enjoy the event as a guest.”**

Normally when I book a client event I’m often the one facilitating and making sure everything goes smoothly. In this case I actually got to enjoy the event as a guest. There were so many compliments from both my colleagues and clients. 

Alaina.

## ****Case Study 3:**A Surprise Birthday Dinner****** , 10 Guests

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2040%2040'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/public-vs-private-icon.svg)

Headcount: 10 Guests

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2040%2040'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/food-icon.svg)

Use Case: Birthday Party

### **Challenge**

Luke wanted to surprise his girlfriend with an intimate birthday dinner that was not just another meal but a truly special experience. He opted for a custom Interactive Meal at [The Little Owl](https://www.thelittleowlnyc.com/), a cozy yet upscale restaurant. Since this was an out-of-network venue, we needed to seamlessly integrate the Avital experience while allowing guests to order a la carte.

### **Solution**

We customized the Interactive Meal to fit our client’s group dining goals. Since The Little Owl wasn’t in our network of restaurant partners, we onboarded them specifically for this client’s event. Instead of a prix fixe menu, guests ordered a la carte, but we still ensured Avital’s signature touch with engaging activities. Avital’s host, Sophie, kept guests entertained and fully immersed in the experience. 

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/little-owl-via-opentable-150x150.jpg)

##### The Little Owl Restaurant Venue

Custom Onboard 

This event was hosted at The Little Owl, a small Mediterranean restaurant in the West Village. The Little Owl wasn't in Avital's network of partners, but we custom onboarded them to meet the client's event goals.

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sophie-avital-group-dining-host-150x150.jpg)

##### Expert Hosts Sophie

Our expert NYC host, Sophie, facilitated this event and had a blast doing it. She connected with each guest individually as she led the activities. She also connected with the Little Owl staff who were all absolutely delightful.

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/group-of-people-shaking-cocktails-during-private-dining-event-150x150.jpg)

##### Engaging Activities

The guests talked about how much they loved all of the activities and how it was impossible to choose a favorite! They laughed, engaged, and connected throughout the experience. 

![thumbnail](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![thumbnail](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/men-laughing-at-table-during-interactive-meal-150x150.jpg)

##### A la Carte Menu

Unlike our standard prix fixe menu which comes included with our Interactive Meal, this client chose a different approach and had everyone order a la carte.

### **Results**

Luke and the birthday girl were so delighted! All of their guests were so impressed by the experience and had so much fun. It was such a memorable event and we are so pleased to have been a part of it. 

#### Client Rating: 7/7 – Blown away, so thrilled!!

#### Host Rating: 7/7 – Best event I’ve ever done. Deserves a gold medal! 

### **“The epitome of surprise and delight!”**

The epitome of surprise and delight! We had so much fun and my girlfriend could not have been more surprised. A birthday to truly remember forever.
