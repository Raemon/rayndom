### Cooking Class

Cooking classes can be a fun way to bond with your team. We find that interactive experiences are often the most effective way to encourage conversation and bonding, and good food is something everyone can bond over.

![woman making bruschetta during cooking class in nyc](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20900%20700'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![woman making bruschetta during cooking class in nyc](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/woman-making-bruschetta-during-cooking-class-1.jpg)

### Cooking Competition

If your team enjoys competition a cooking competition in the style of a popular cooking show like Chopped can be a great source of entertainment. Give each team a basket of mystery ingredients and have them work together to whip up a meal on the fly for the judges to try.

![man laughing during avital interactive meal at one of the best private dining room san francisco ca](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20963%20642'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![man laughing during avital interactive meal at one of the best private dining room san francisco ca](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/man-laughing-during-avital-interactive-meal-at-one-of-the-best-private-dining-room-san-francisco-ca.jpg)

### Interactive Meal

If you want gets to enjoy a full meal and get hands-on, but a cooking class feels like a bit too much work (we get it!), then consider and [Interactive Meal](https://avitalexperiences.com/interactive-meals/). The Interactive Meal is a private dining experience featuring a 4-course meal with beverages, plus 3 interactive activities sprinkled throughout. It’s more fun than a standard banquet, but more approachable than a cooking class. 

## Live Music Company Party Entertainment Ideas

Whether it’s the main act or subtle background entertainment, live music can really elevate an experience and make it memorable. But choosing music that everyone loves can feel like a real challenge. Here are a few of our crowd-pleasing recommendations. 

![dj performing at corporate event](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20963%20642'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![dj performing at corporate event](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/dj-performing-at-corporate-event.jpg)

### Get a DJ

If your team likes to dance the night away a live DJ can create the perfect atmosphere for team bonding on the dance floor. DJs can also go from pop to country to rock, making it a crowd-pleasing option for all groups. 

![band performance for corporate event entertainment](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20963%20642'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![band performance for corporate event entertainment](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/band-performance-for-corporate-event-entertainment.jpg)

### Hire a Band

Live music adds a palpable energy to a corporate event that pre-recorded playlists just can’t replicate. Budget tip: source locally! You’d be surprised by the level of talent your hometown band has to offer.

![string quartet playing against black stage](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20963%20642'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![string quartet playing against black stage](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/string-quartet-playing-against-black-stage.jpg)

### Bring in a String Quartet

Add a touch of elegance to your corporate event by sourcing a string quartet. String quartets are no longer for classical music fans only! Check out quartets like [The Vitamin String Quartet](https://www.vitaminstringquartet.com) who play all the pop hits for the best of both worlds. 

### Create an Office Band

Why go outside the company when there’s the possibility of immense talent lurking within? Ask around the office, and if you can get a guitarist, singer, and percussionist together a few nights after work to rehearse you have yourself an office band!

## Trivia & Games Entertainment Options for Corporate Events

Got gamers in your group? Games and trivia can be a great way to get groups to engage with one another naturally. Plus a little competition can lead to more fun and lasting memories. 

### Themed Trivia

If your event already has a theme it can be fun to rope it into your trivia game. For example, if your event has a film theme you might look for fun questions about the film’s characters, actors, and directors.

### Pop Culture

Pop Culture Trivia is a great go-to if you’re unsure what specific theme your guests will all enjoy. This is also an easy category to find pre-made trivia sheets for online and it can lead to fun topical discussions between your guests.

### Company-Specific

If you’re entertaining a fully in-house event it can be fun to do trivia themed around the company, or even different people on your team. You can ask questions about the year the company was founded, who was the first CEO, or how big the team was the first year. Or you can ask your team for fun facts and make a trivia game about matching the facts to the person, which is a fun way to get to know each other better.

### Employee Talent Show

If you’ve got a group of outgoing employees, encourage them to show off their talents. Plan ahead so people have time to practice and prepare. They can even sign up as teams for music, dance, and other performances. Have spectators vote for the winner, but make sure everyone is awarded for their participation. 

### Who’s That Baby?

A classic for a reason! Ask everyone to bring in a photo of themselves as a baby and pin them up on the wall at the event. Each guest can pass by at their leisure and try to match the baby to the name. It’s not only adorable but strikes up friendly discussion and event stories from childhood. 

![man holding up embrace quirky card during corporate entertainment ](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20900%20700'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![man holding up embrace quirky card during corporate entertainment ](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/man-holding-quirky-card-2.jpg)

### Embrace Quirky 

One of our favorite games at Avital Experiences is the “Embrace Quirky Game.” Essentially everyone writes a quirky fact about themselves on a card. Then all of the cards are read and everyone has to try and guess whose quirky fact it is. It’s one of our favorite games for striking up hilarious, meaningful conversation and building connections. 

## Arts & Entertainment Ideas for Corporate Events

For a group that’s looking to sit back and be entertained, here are a few our our favorite entertainment ideas for corporate events. From live art installations to a classic magician, these are sure to please. 

![magician looking at glass ball during corporate talent show](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20963%20642'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![magician looking at glass ball during corporate talent show](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/magician-looking-at-glass-ball-during-corporate-talent-show.jpg)

### Magician

You’re never too old to be impressed and bewildered by a talented magician! Many magicians cater specifically to corporate clientele and can deliver a refined magic act with ample opportunities for audience participation.

![woman live painting mural during corporate event](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20963%20642'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![woman live painting mural during corporate event](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/woman-live-painting-mural-during-corporate-event.jpg)

### Live Visual Artist 

A unique way to add a special and lasting touch to your corporate event is to bring in a [live visual artist](https://pintalis.com/en/live-painting/). Whether they’re painting a mural in your conference room, creating a graffiti graphic for a brand launch, or create a special piece to commemorate the event, the options are endless. 

### Host a Roast 

Got an easy-going CEO or head of HR? Put them in the hot seat for a night of jokes and laughs. A roast can be one of the best ways to bring groups together through comedy and stories, but you have to make sure the person you are roasting is 100% agreeable. 

![two women comedians on stage](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20963%20642'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![two women comedians on stage](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/two-women-comedians-on-stage.jpg)

### Hire a Comedian 

If a roast isn’t quite the vibe, but you want a healthy dose of comedy, hire a comedian! There are corporate comedians who specialize in team and client comedy so you can be sure it will be appropriate, yet still funny for all. 

![man painting cartoon portraits during corporate event](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20963%20642'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![man painting cartoon portraits during corporate event](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/man-painting-cartoon-portraits-during-corporate-event.jpg)

### Cartoon Artist

Did you ever get your caricatures done at the fair as a kid? This is a timeless activity and so much fun. Plus it makes a great take home gift for your guests. You can go with the [classic caricatures](https://goofyfaces.com/) where they emphasize everyone’s features or for a more muted and artistic approach. 

## Other Entertainment Ideas for Corporate Events 

We’re rounding out the list with a few extra ideas that are great for all groups. 

![hands at casino table for corporate event](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20963%20642'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![hands at casino table for corporate event](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hands-at-casino-table-for-corporate-event.jpg)

### Casino Night

Take your event theming to the next level with a Casino Night! Set up tables where your guests can play blackjack and poker and provide everyone with a bunch of free chips. At the end of the night, the three people with the most chips can be awarded a fun and quirky prize.

![escape room neon sign](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20467'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![escape room neon sign](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/go-to-escape-room-for-birthday-in-SF.jpg)
