#  Our Favorite Indian Restaurant in Los Angeles Downtown Culver City 

May 30, 2018 

When it comes to Indian food, we’re big fans. We love it for lazy takeout, a great lunch buffet, or a dinner full of samosas. In LA there are a lot of great restaurants. If you don’t want to make the trek to [Artesia’s Little India](http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/guide/neighborhood-guide-artesias-little-india/), you’ll find a lot of great eats in Culver City. We couldn’t pick just one favorite Indian restaurant in Los Angeles downtown Culver City, so here are a few to choose from.

## **Mayura**

[![Looking for our Our Favorite Indian Restaurant in Los Angeles Downtown Culver City? Head to Mayura](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2018-05-07-at-3.32.48-PM.png)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2018-05-07-at-3.32.48-PM.png)

Perhaps the most popular Indian restaurant in downtown Culver City is [Mayura](http://mayura-indian-restaurant.com/). Like so many great LA restaurants it’s hidden in a strip mall. The food is regionally specific to Kerala, South India. It’s so good that LA Times food editor Jonathan Gold put Mayura on his list of the [101 Best Restaurants ](http://ballots.latimes.com/lists/jonathan-golds-101-best-restaurants-2016/)in LA. Mayura has a separate vegetarian kitchen so your vegetarian friend’s needs and your chicken tikka masala cravings can both be satisfied. They’re not one to be humble; Mayura’s website features a section titled “Why Mayura is the best Indian restaurant in Culver City”.

## **Samosa** **House**

[![Samosa is one of Our Favorite Indian Restaurant in Los Angeles Downtown Culver City](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/Get-Samosas-at-Samosa-House-some-of-The-Best-Indian-Food-in-Los-Angeles.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/Get-Samosas-at-Samosa-House-some-of-The-Best-Indian-Food-in-Los-Angeles.jpg)

Samosa lovers unite! This is your place. Head to [Samosa House East](http://www.samosahouse.com/) in Culver City. Though the westside branch has one of Southern California’s largest Indian supermarket, this location still has all the samosas, curries, chaats, and pakoras you want. They even have vegan mango lassi, because this is LA.

## **Tara’s Himalayan Cuisine**

[![Don't forget the Momos when getting Our Favorite Indian Restaurant in Los Angeles Downtown Culver City](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20640%20424'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Don't forget the Momos when getting Our Favorite Indian Restaurant in Los Angeles Downtown Culver City](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/Momos-like-the-ones-served-at-Tara’s-Himalayan-Cuisine-on-the-list-of-The-Best-Indian-Food-in-Los-Angeles.jpg)](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/Momos-like-the-ones-served-at-Tara’s-Himalayan-Cuisine-on-the-list-of-The-Best-Indian-Food-in-Los-Angeles.jpg)

Folks from Northern India love [Tara’s Himalayan Cuisine](http://tarashimalayancuisine.com/), which serves food a little different than our other favorite spots. Tara’s serves Himalayan cuisine from Nepal and Tibet and their mountain grown herbs and spices come directly from Nepal. Tara, the owner, is a classically trained dancer who wanted to share her love of Nepali culture. The momos (dumplings) are a must as are the curries.
