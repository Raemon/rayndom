### Ferry Plaza Farmers Market

Stop by the Ferry Building Saturday morning to experience a [Farmers’ Market](https://foodwise.org/markets/ferry-plaza-farmers-market/) unlike any other. With over 100 vendors and stalls hawking everything from fresh, local produce to artisan baked goods, and even lunch and brunch made to order. There’s no way anyone is leaving here hungry!

This is also the best area to shop for second-hand books and records.

## Day Trips Near San Francisco for Groups

If you want to show your group even more than just San Francisco proper, consider a day trip to nearby attractions. 

![Redwoods from Muir wood tower over hiking groups](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20835%201024'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Redwoods from Muir wood tower over hiking groups](https://avitalexperiences.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_9115-835x1024.jpeg)@goldengatenps

### Muir Woods

The ancient Coastal Redwood Trees in [Muir Woods](https://www.nps.gov/muwo/index.htm) have to be seen to be believed. They tower over you at heights up to 250 feet, and some have been around for over 1,200 years. You can combine seeing the park with a trip to Sausalito with tours like [this one by Gray Line](https://graylineofsanfrancisco.com/tours/muir-woods-sausalito-tour/).
