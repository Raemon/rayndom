### Reception Room / Library

With rich hues, the wood-paneled Library features a large marble fireplace, Grand Piano, bookcases and graceful French doors that open to a center courtyard. The room’s Gothic bay window catches the light filtered through the oaks on the lawns just beyond providing a warm, intimate setting for your wedding reception. (25′ W x 39′ L)

### Great Hall

The dramatic, architecturally detailed Great Hall, was built with music and entertaining in mind. Its expansive ceilings, oak paneling and walnut floor create a fine acoustical setting for music at your reception. The Great Hall is ideal for sit down receptions because of the dramatic effect from the amazing architectural details. (26′ W x 58′ L)

### Dining Room

A lighter twin of the Library and described as a “dream in Nile” with its pale green and ivory walls, the spacious and airy Dining Room has delicate, pristine-white plaster relief on the walls and a perfect stucco domed ceiling. This marvelous dining environment shares the Library’s view of the oak-studded lawns through its own bay windows. (25′ W x 36′ L)

### Rose Garden

The private English rose garden at the east wing of the mansion includes over 100 hybrid tea rose bushes, of every imaginable color. The rose beds are surrounded by sculpted English boxwood hedges and red brick walkways. It’s the perfect place for beautiful photos, a cocktail reception or a quiet stroll and a chance to smell the roses.
