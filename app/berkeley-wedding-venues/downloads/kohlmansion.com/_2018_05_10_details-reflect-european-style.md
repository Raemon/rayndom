# Details Reflect European Style

The house has many careful architectural details. The ancient oak trees surrounding the house are reflected in the oak leaves and acorns carved into the wood, especially in the entry and the library. The Kohls brought artisans from Europe to do plaster detailing. They created Pompeiian “grotesque” panels in the Library, Robert Adam-style relief work in the dining room, and also ram’s heads in the corners of the billiard room ceiling. The sisters had these shaved off as inappropriate for a convent when they bought the mansion in 1924. Plaster experts restored the ram’s heads after the ’89 earthquake.
