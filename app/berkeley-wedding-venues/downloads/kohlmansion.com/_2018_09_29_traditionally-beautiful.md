# Traditionally beautiful

A flashback to Labor Day weekend at Kohl Mansion! It served as the perfect venue for this couple’s wedding day. Elegant tablescapes created a cohesive ambiance for all guests to enjoy. They had a blast dancing and incorporated many traditional dances. The ceremony took place on the lawn and was a lovely setting for the bride and groom to wed underneath the chuppah!
