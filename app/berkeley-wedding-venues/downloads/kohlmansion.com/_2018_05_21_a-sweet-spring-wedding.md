# A sweet spring wedding

Springtime weddings at Kohl are always fabulous! With a mix of pink and navy, this wedding was stunning! The ceremony took place in the Green Room, followed by dinner and dancing in the majestic Great Hall. Guests gathered for a beautiful night filled with so much happiness and excitement!
