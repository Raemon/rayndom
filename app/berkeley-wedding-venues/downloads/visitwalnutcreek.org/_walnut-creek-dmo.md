# Helpful, Essential

Visit Walnut Creek is a Tourism Business Improvement District (TBID) and Destination Marketing Organization (DMO.)

A Tourism Business Improvement District (TBID) is a collaboration of lodging properties that pay an assessment on individual room night stays. The assessment—a nominal fee (Transient Occupancy Tax/TOT) passed onto each hotel guest —provides funding for destination marketing and development to bring more visitors to the destination.

Visit Walnut Creek is a catalyst for a strong economy. We attract visitors from other areas which bring new dollars to the community. The hotels provide a location for conferences, meetings, and events attendees, thus bringing new visitors to Walnut Creek who dine and shop locally. This spending generates revenue for the hotels, which results in increased Transient Occupancy Taxes (TOT) going to the City and increased sales taxes generated at restaurants and local businesses.

The boundary for the Tourism Business Improvement District (TBID) is the Walnut Creek limit and the two hotels located in unincorporated Walnut Creek.
