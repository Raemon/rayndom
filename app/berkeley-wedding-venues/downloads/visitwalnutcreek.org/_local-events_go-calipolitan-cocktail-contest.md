**_Launches New Website, Slogan and Citywide Cocktail Contest_**

**(MONDAY, June 7, 2021),** As we all get back to going out and about, The Walnut Creek Visitors Bureau is actively creating new ways to promote Walnut Creek as a safe and fun destination for small meetings, conferences, social events, hiking, biking, dining, shopping and more! 

Rebranding our city with a new website and slogan, “Go Calipolitan,” we are differentiating Walnut Creek as a destination offering a unique mix of the laidback California lifestyle and a metropolitan flair. 

To bring our eclectic “mix” to life, Walnut Creek is launching a contest for restaurants, bars, and local caterers to mix a winning signature cocktail and non-alcoholic beverage called The Calipolitan. 

The task? To create a recipe for the “The Calipolitan” that captures the vibrancy and charm of Walnut Creek. The winning cocktail will be featured at every bar and restaurant all over the city for at least one year to continue to give visitors the best California experiences under the sun. 

The steps? From June 8th to June 22nd, contestants will enter the contest by clicking here: [**SUBMISSION FORM**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSff2vrxjCK-UxdTm-TBu13t0nkFWK-EBvZzkkzf9CY30rug6g/viewform). No secret elements of the recipes are required at the point of submission. Once the submissions are narrowed down to a number of chosen contestants, there will be a “Go Calipolitan” tasting event on **Wednesday, July 7th, 2021 at The Renaissance Bay Club in Walnut Creek (Invitation Only).** The winning cocktail will be chosen at the event and announced on social media. The winning contestant will receive bragging rights, have their cocktail served throughout participating Walnut Creek establishments for one year (at least), and a mystery prize. 

“We are so excited to re-introduce ourselves to visitors, event planners, and hotel guests. This is just the beginning of marketing efforts we’ll share to establish Walnut Creek as the perfect place for small meetings in California and eclectic experiences for visitors” says Nicole Hankton, Director of Sales and Marketing for Visit Walnut Creek. “We want everyone to Go Calipolitan!” 

The Visitors Bureau chose Creative:MINT, a marketing agency with locations in San Francisco and Walnut Creek, as the creative force behind the re-branding. “We love our city, Walnut Creek, and all that it has to offer, and our brand collaboration with the Walnut Creek Visitors Bureau comes straight from the heart of our team,” says Calvin Jung, Owner and Creative Director of Creative:MINT. “We want to share the wonderful activities and places of this charismatic city so that visitors can create their own experiences and adventures.”
