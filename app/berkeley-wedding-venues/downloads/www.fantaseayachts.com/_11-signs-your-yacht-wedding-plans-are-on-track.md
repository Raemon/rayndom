You’re dreaming of a luxurious [yacht wedding](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/weddings/)! Best couple decision ever. Exchanging your vows on the sun-kissed waters of Marina del Rey is as romantic as it gets and, really, not that hard to pull off. Sure there’s a lot to do, but with a little planning, your special day will be a memorable celebration. 

Now what? If you’re in the midst of wedding planning, sometimes it helps to skirt potential overwhelm by having a timeline in place. Remember your dedicated yacht wedding specialist will help with many aspects of the planning process and the logistics on the special day. Be as involved or not involved as you wish. 

For some people, peace of mind comes in the form of a glorious list. We get that. To help with planning, we provided some tips to help you gauge whether you are making the right progress for the perfect yacht wedding.

## A Yacht Wedding Timeline

If you can break down your tasks by month, you can keep the process fun rather than stressful. Don’t forget to celebrate your accomplishments after you’ve completed your tasks for the month. 

Every couple’s engagement time is different, even though 12 to 14 months is the ideal length. If your engagement length is shorter, condense the wedding schedule. In case your wedding is in six months, try to complete tasks 1-3 below in the first month, and then you’ll be on schedule. 

Here are the top 11 ways to make sure your yacht wedding planning is on track.

## 1\. You have a realistic budget (12 months out)

Time to crunch some numbers and do some math. To start planning your wedding, you must determine who is paying for what and what your bottom line is. Then you’ll want to break down your budget – what is a priority and what isn’t? – and allocate funds accordingly.

![plan a budget for a yacht wedding](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Plan-a-budget-for-a-yacht-wedding-300x220.png)

It’s a good idea to start a detailed spreadsheet right from the beginning because these numbers will change as you plan. By doing this, you will be able to track your spending and adjust numbers as needed. 

## 2\. You selected the perfect yacht (12 months out)

Choose from our three gorgeous yachts. FantaSea Yachts [boat wedding venues](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/boat-wedding-trends-for-2022/) are in high demand so choose as soon as you can. Arrange a private tour or take a look online to find the perfect yacht for your needs. 

The size of the yacht will depend on the number of guests attending, yacht style, and budget, so it’s best not to miss out by booking at least 12 months ahead – just in case you have a special date in mind.

![a romantic boat wedding](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/romantic-boat-wedding-300x220.png)

Working with a shorter timeline? No worries. We’ll work with you to find something perfect for you.

## 3\. You hired your vendors (11 months out)

Make sure your photographer, DJ, and videographer are available when you need them

These are the people who will make your wedding day memorable. Take some time to research your photographer and ask all the right questions before hiring them. Your engagement portraits may even be a great way to get to know them better. 

The same goes for the DJ. Be sure to see examples of weddings they have provided music for so you can be sure their style matches your expectations. Since [yacht weddings](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/weddings/pricing-and-packages/) are so special, you want to be sure to choose a DJ that has experience managing a boat wedding. We’re happy to share our list of experienced vendors who know how to craft the ultimate wedding experience.

## 4\. You purchased your wedding dress (9 months out)

It’s okay if you don’t know exactly what you want. Wedding dress shopping can be a challenge. The perfect dress can seem impossible to find when there are so many factors to consider, such as price points, styles, silhouettes, fabrics, and much more. When it comes to bridal fashion, most brides wonder: Where do I even begin?

![wedding dress for a boat wedding](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Wedding-dress-for-a-boat-wedding-300x220.png)

For a yacht wedding, anything goes. A good way to narrow down your dress choices is to determine if you’re having a [yacht wedding reception during the day or at night](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/yacht-party-day-or-night/). 

From choosing your dream dress to who to take shopping with you, you’ll be guided through every step of the process in this [ultimate guide to wedding dresses](https://www.brides.com/story/wedding-dress-shopping-guide). You deserve to look and feel your best, no matter what your fashion preference might be.

## 5\. You booked your honeymoon (6 months out)

At the end of a marathon wedding planning process, the honeymoon is a well-earned reward. While it might seem odd to plan your trip around the same time you plan your wedding, that is exactly what you should do, especially if you have no idea where you want to go. 

Make sure you plan your honeymoon at least 6 months ahead. This will give you enough time to settle on a destination, book travel, and accommodations, and, if you plan to work with a travel agent, get on their schedule. If you [establish a few key milestones](https://www.brides.com/story/honeymoon-booking-tips) and determine when and where you should embark, your journey will be infinitely more joyful than stressful. 

## 6\. You ordered your wedding cake (5 months out)

Make sure you and your partner agree on the cake look and flavor profile. It is not necessary to please all your guests. The cake is a personal choice and an expression of how you want to celebrate your nuptials.

![order wedding cake for yacht wedding in advance](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/wedding-cake-for-a-yacht-wedding-300x220.png)

Once you decide on a cake, you will need a baker. Choose a reputable designer who is available on your date and happy to take on your dream design. 

A **unique venue** like a **luxury yacht** calls for a special cake and wedding decor. The best memories will be made when every detail is exactly what you and your partner want.

## 7\. You purchased your rings (4 months out)

Two months before the wedding, couples should pick out their wedding bands. By doing so, you will be able to accommodate any last-minute wedding planning details that might arise, and your rings will already be in production.

When it comes to choosing, designing, or wearing engagement and wedding rings, there’s no right or wrong answer. Wear one, two, three, or even more rings to symbolize your love and marriage—just make sure the ring (or rings) you choose will have enduring meaning to you and your partner for many years to come.

## 8\. You wrote your vows (3 months out)

Do you want to write your wedding vows? You’re summing up your love, dreams, and promises to your partner in just a few minutes. It may seem overwhelming, but it’s worth the effort: you get to tell your story, show guests what makes your relationship tick, and share meaningful words with the one you love. 

If you prepare your vows at least three months ahead, the process is not rushed, and you can find the perfect words for expressing your love for one another, completing your perfect [wedding on a yacht](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/all-inclusive-boat-wedding-packages-include-these-4-things/).

## 9\. You sent your invitations (2 months out)

You need to send the wedding invitations (with RSVPs due one month before the wedding). You have already completed the most difficult part of the selection process. Now all you have to do is print and assemble.

If you wish, you can include rehearsal dinner invitations with the wedding invitations.

Make sure you provide your partner’s family with an accurate list of addresses and feel free to discuss the design and overall aesthetic of the rehearsal dinner. It shouldn’t be a replica of the reception the next night, but you should also ensure you don’t show up in black tie to a BBQ buffet.

When choosing the perfect [yacht for wedding reception](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/celebrations/) success, include an RSVP in your invitation to help make sure you have enough food but not more than necessary. This will help you keep expenses in line and know who is planning to help celebrate your special day.

## 10\. You determined the music list and order of events (1 month out)

Without a quality DJ and killer playlist, a wedding reception would not be complete. However, hiring a DJ requires more than just a phone call. Prepare a DJ checklist with all your requests in advance.

![boat wedding venues in marina del rey](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Boat-wedding-venues-300x220.png)

To be certain that the order of events goes as you and your partner want, be sure to provide [a detailed checklist](https://weddingfrontier.com/dj-wedding-checklist/) to your DJ at least one month out so he or she can be prepared to execute it according to your wishes. 

## 11 – You had your final dress fitting (1 week out)

On the day of your final fitting, invite your maid of honor along so she can learn more about your gown. Is it necessary to bustle it? Let the salesperson show them how. Are the straps or buttons complicated? Make sure they are comfortable using them before the wedding. 

You should also learn how to get rid of last-minute wrinkles now. Is an iron necessary? What setting should I use? Would steaming be a better option? If you spill something on the gown, what should you do? Do you need to use certain products?

## Conclusion

There’s no doubt that wedding planning can be stressful and time-consuming, especially when you don’t know where to start. Keeping to a schedule like we’ve laid out above can help keep you on track and ensure your amazing yacht wedding is perfect for you and your partner.
