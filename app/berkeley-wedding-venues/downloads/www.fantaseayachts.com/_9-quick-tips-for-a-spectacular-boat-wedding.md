Getting married on a yacht is a wow factor in itself. There are many factors that make it unique – nautical charm, one-of-a-kind venue, and a memorable setting for your guests. 

But in a sea of [boat weddings in California](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/weddings/), how do you know which venue to choose? And once you choose your venue, how do you even know where to begin?  


That’s where we come in. 

**FantaSea Yachts** has served the Los Angeles area since 1980. Our fleet of custom yachts is made for parties of every kind. 

But yacht weddings are our specialty. 

With an experienced event staff at the helm, here are nine tips to consider when planning your boat wedding. 

## **1\. Location matters**  


If wedding planning has you California dreaming, there is [no better boat wedding venue than the shimmering waters of Marina del Rey.](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/five-reasons-why-a-yacht-wedding-in-marina-del-rey-is-best/) And chances are if you’re reading this, you have your mind (and heart) set on a dreamy yacht wedding.  
  
It’s no secret that **boat weddings in California** offer expansive ocean views, but a yacht wedding in Marina del Rey ups the ante with one word: location, location, location! (ok, maybe three words).

Marina del Rey boasts a major convenience that your out-of-town guests will appreciate: a quick four-mile ride from LAX.   


If that’s not enough, the Marina also neighbors world-famous Venice Beach and sun-kissed Santa Monica with its resplendent pier and carnival-like atmosphere. These two beach towns are primed for any SoCal bucket visit list. 

Thanks to the influx of tourism in the area, these cities offer a bounty of accommodations, restaurants, and unique shopping to satisfy every friend or family member coming into the Marina from out of town for your event.

That’s a tremendous allure for those not from the Los Angeles area as they can celebrate your nuptials and then create a mini-vacation before and after the last champagne bottle onboard the yacht has popped.

## **2\. A yacht with a view**  


One perk that you don’t have to plan for (if only to keep in mind for that perfect photo opp) is the breathtaking view.   


Our guests are often wowed by fiery sunsets. A glistening ocean. Stunning yachts. The Los Angeles coastline. An occasional dolphin or two.  


A FantaSea Yacht wedding serves up million-dollar views in a romantic setting that’s beyond Instagram-worthy.   


So as you plan your boat wedding, remember to choose your views. 

## **3\. Day or night?****  
**

Brides, take note: The [time of day for your boat wedding](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/yacht-party-day-or-night/) can impact the vibe of your wedding day. And depending on your style, you might say “I do” under sunsets, stars, or sunny skies.  


Do you envision cocktail dresses and sharp suits? Formal gowns and classic tuxedos? Then your wedding is best suited for the evening.

If you’re opting for a more casual feel with a bright, airy vibe and gorgeous brunch display, then daytime is probably best. 

## **4\. Lean into your surroundings**  


Couples often think of the Marina’s gorgeous backdrop as an added bonus to their big day. Because it is!  
  
Brides and grooms look forward to a spectacular sunset for amazing photos and rely on the twinkling lights of the harbor and stars to add to the romance.   
  
Our daytime couples enjoy the sights on the water, like coveted coastline views all the way to Malibu. Daytime is also great for seeing wildlife (always a hit!) and yacht spotting in the harbor.   
  
But the magic can also come alive at night. Think special lighting enhancements (gobos and sparklers) and other fun details. Incorporate your surroundings into the decor to make your wedding a one-of-kind experience. 

## **5\. Picture perfect photography**  


Though loved ones will surround you on your special day, one guest will be just as important: your [wedding photographer](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-photography-getting-started).   
  
This individual is responsible for capturing the most intimate, celebratory moments of this joyous occasion — moments to relive on your anniversary and share with your children.   
  
Yes, it’s important that your photographer has a creative eye and takes stunning pictures, but it’s just as important that they are confident in their environment.   
  
In this case, an experienced yacht photographer knows when to capture that sunset magic, and knows how to prepare for outdoor elements like darker skies or even a light wind from the ocean breeze.   
  
If you’re not sure where to begin, we have a list of vendors to help you get a jump start. And these pros know our yachts like the back of their hands to help you get the best shot.

## **6\. Select your vendors**  


Speaking of vendors, our team is an experienced group of event planning professionals with a deep and trusted vendor list ready to serve.  
  
Need help with a DJ, band, or florist? We can recommend proven crowd-pleasers.   
  
Considering table linens? We’ll arrange for full table mock-ups to help you decide your best look.   
  
If you have your own dream team in mind, no problem! We’re happy to coordinate logistics on your behalf. 

## **7\. Accessibility**  


Nothing is more important than having your loved ones celebrate this momentous occasion with you. Our FantaSea Yachts One yacht is ADA compliant and offers a service elevator, accommodating restrooms, and easy access to main areas. 

## **8\. Set your guest list and budget accordingly****  
**

As you build your guest list, ask yourself if you want a big bash or an intimate affair? Determining a headcount from the beginning will ease the headache of unaccounted space issues and expenses.  
  
A guest list will also determine the best yacht rental for your wedding AND your budget. [Establishing a budget](https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-ideas/6-simple-steps-to-setting-a-wedding-budget) early on will help identify your priorities.   
  
Is it entertainment? Decor? Flowers? WIth monies clearly earmarked, you can confidently set forth wedding planning using your priorities as guideposts. 

## **9\. Choose your yacht**  


Let the fun begin! As you tour our yacht fleet, imagine your wedding day.  
  
Dreaming of open sky decks and ocean views? Planning on a small dance floor?   
  
Looking for space to offer a unique and fun experience like a whiskey tasting or cigar rolling? Considering a lounge area to connect and chat with guests?   
  
We’ve got you covered.  
  
Our yachts are a blank canvas waiting to be dressed in your vision. From the [Dandeana ](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/yachts/dandeana/)to [FantaSea One](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/yachts/fantasea-one/), every nook and cranny transforms to meet your needs.   
  
It’s just up to you to pick “the one.” We recommend scheduling a tour with one of our event professionals to walk you through each yacht, detail by detail.

**People Also Ask:**

**Are boat weddings popular?** Boat weddings are considered an excellent venue choice. They provide a beautiful and all-inclusive experience. There is no moving from one place to another before, during, and after the ceremony as in land-based wedding venues. Everything happens in one place with the ever-changing backdrop of Marina del Rey.
