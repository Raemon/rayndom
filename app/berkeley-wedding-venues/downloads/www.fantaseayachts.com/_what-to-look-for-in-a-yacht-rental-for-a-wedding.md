Planning your [wedding on a yacht](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/weddings/) should be, well, smooth sailing. There are instant benefits to choosing a yacht rental as your wedding venue — exclusivity, breathtaking views, and a pristine wow factor are a few that come to mind.

But, what else should you consider when deciding on the yacht of your wedding daydreams? We’ve got a few tips (and 40+ plus years of experience) to help guide you through the process. 

  1. **Experience**  
There’s no doubt that you’ll want an [experienced team of event professionals](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/about/why-fantasea/) at your side to help with logistics, coordination, creative ideas, and other special touches. At FantaSea Yachts, we’re proud to have served the Los Angeles area since 1980 and have a dedicated team of wedding extraordinnaires who have seen and heard it all (translation: we’re ready for any request and are here to make your dreams come true). 

But planning isn’t our only specialty. We shine in day-of coordination. Event set-up and takedown, vendor coordination, time checks, and any last-minute needs that arise. We handle it all so you don’t have to worry or lift a finger. Our team of professionals thrives on delivering exceptional service from start to finish, from concept to execution, all in the name of love.



  2. **Space  
** Before deciding on your yacht, it’s important to tour the fleet. You’ll want to consider the size of your guest list to see how different layouts can be customized to accommodate your guests (and vision). Speaking of, seeing the yacht IRL will give a good sense of event flow and help you envision the details of your big day. Do you want a grand or intimate vibe? Are you looking for large windows and sparkling chandeliers? Enough room to accommodate a large dance floor? Open sky decks to soak in the sunset? All of these factors will help you decide [which yacht is best](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/yachts/) for your wedding celebration.
  3. **Accessibility**  
Nothing is more important than having your loved ones celebrate this momentous occasion with you. Check with your yacht rental company to ensure that their yachts are ADA compliant and offer accommodating restrooms and easy access to main areas.
  4. **Menu  
** Ah, food. One of the many perks of wedding planning. Appetizers, three-course dinners, full-blown buffets, signature cocktails, post-wedding late-night bites, and other delectable delights (i.e., wedding cake!) are just a few things that might graze your mind as you decide what to serve your guests. Be sure to ask the yacht rental company their plan for meal service. We are pleased to offer an expert culinary team (our head chef hails from the Ritz-Carlton, Laguna Nigel) who dish up seasonal menus and can customize dishes as needed.**  
**
  5. **Location  
** It’s a given that getting married on a yacht comes with shimmering water views. But how easy is it for your guests to get to those shimmering water views? A centralized location is key to convenient travel and it doesn’t get any more convenient than being located near an airport, especially if you have international guests! At FantaSea Yachts, we are a hop, skip, and a jump away from [Los Angeles International Airport (LAX)](https://www.flylax.com/) making it a breeze for travelers to join the festivities. With a four-mile drive from the airport and plentiful hotels to plan your stay (from global brands like the Ritz-Carlton and Marriott to boutique properties), there’s no better destination to make wedding travels a snap. Not to mention we are steps away from world-famous Venice Beach and other popular attractions like the Santa Monica Pier. Easy come, easy go!

**People Also Ask:**

**How do you plan a yacht for a wedding?**

Yacht weddings are simple once you understand what to plan for and who to plan with. Consider your guest list, time of year, and guest accommodations among other considerations.

**Can I get married on a yacht?**

Yes, you can! All of our captains are ordained to perform wedding ceremonies on board any of our yachts.
