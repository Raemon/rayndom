You are not wrong if you think [getting married on a yacht](/weddings/) is one of the most romantic ways to make things official with your significant other. Sparkling waters, a dramatic sunset, a beautiful yacht boat rental, and our positive associations with travel all contribute to making this one of life’s most memorable moments.

There’s a saying that matches are made in heaven, and we agree with that statement. Getting married on a yacht offers a heavenly feeling that no other venue can match. Yes, you read that correctly! A yacht wedding is surreal, classic, fun, and an event that you will never forget.

Here are 3 ways getting married on a yacht is magical and why FantaSea Yachts is your [wedding yacht rental](/celebrations/) solution.

## It’s a stress-free affair handled by professionals

Weddings are fun, but they can quickly turn into stressful affairs if not planned correctly. There is no doubt that unplanned events can create havoc and ruin the fun and excitement.

With a wedding, you will have everything under one roof, such as a designated wedding planner, a private venue, music, decor, coordinator, etc. A [stress-free wedding](https://www.brides.com/story/handling-your-wedding-day-with-anxiety) is possible with professionals handling everything from cooking to photography to serving the guests. To ensure that everything runs smoothly, we assign a dedicated team of professionals to your wedding.

Our team at FantaSea Yachts understands the priorities of our clients and provides them with customized packages based on their preferences. 

No detail is overlooked in our quest to make your wedding a worry-free affair, whether it’s an onboard ceremony with an officiant, the perfect bridal bouquet, or soothing music. Be sure to check out [5 Easy Rules for a Stressless Wedding on a Boat](/5-rules-for-stressless-wedding-on-a-boat/) in addition to all we will share with you here.

**Getting married on a yacht in Southern California** is hassle-free once you make your decision. Our onboard staff is well-trained and experienced in handling events on the water. They anticipate and address any issues leaving you and your partner to relax and enjoy the day. 

It is important to us that you have a magical wedding day. In addition to our strategic brilliance, we show a lot of heart and care in our work. 

Thus, we provide the highest level of hospitality and demonstrate our credibility through our work. We’ve been working our magic for over 40 years! [Just ask our clients](/about/testimonials/).

## It’s cost-effective to have a boat wedding

Yes, you heard correctly! A Marina del Rey [yacht wedding cost](/weddings/pricing-and-packages/) is more affordable than you think. The reason is that when planning a wedding at sea, a lot of event-related decisions are already made. 

The ceremony and reception happen all in one place. You and your guests only need to get to the marina and you’re all set. 

Instant atmosphere: you don’t have to plan for ambiance if you don’t want to. Marina del Rey is famous for its calm waters and magnificent views. A boat wedding puts you closer to nature and away from the hustle and bustle of life on land.

As a result, you can have a more [peaceful](https://www.brides.com/story/what-to-do-the-night-before-your-wedding-day) and private wedding experience than you would with an average in-house wedding at a hotel or other venue. 

The best part about FantaSea Yachts is that all of our packages are custom and pocket-friendly. We customize our packages so that each client can have their ‘dream wedding’ as they imagine it. 

## You’ll make memories to last a lifetime

Getting married on a yacht is an unforgettable experience that you will treasure for a lifetime. A boat wedding provides an incredibly creative backdrop for your wedding photoshoot, one that you will be delighted to look back on for years to come.

If you opt for a boat wedding, you’ll have numerous opportunities to create happy memories, whether it’s the natural beauty of the sea and surroundings or the luxurious interior of the yacht. Many of our yacht interiors are customizable to accommodate whatever theme you have in mind. 

Overall, your wedding ceremony will have all the makings of a dreamlike experience that’s perfect for creating priceless memories. If you choose to tie the knot on a yacht in Marina del Rey, you’re sure to become the “Super Star” among your peers.

![a perfect yacht wedding reception in marina del rey](/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/a-perfect-yacht-wedding-reception-in-marina-del-rey-300x220.png)

What about the reception? A wedding reception on a yacht is more exciting than a traditional indoor reception, which can occasionally become dull. Who hasn’t been to one of those! 

When it comes to the reception, a live band under the stars is pure magic for everyone aboard. For more inspiration, be sure to read [5 Secrets to the Perfect Yacht Wedding Reception](/the-5-secrets-to-the-perfect-yacht-wedding-reception/). 

Invite as few or as many people as you choose because there is “room for everyone” (very literally, of course!). We will help you choose the yacht in our fleet that is best for the number of guests you’re hosting.

And speaking of needs – be sure to take the week before your big day for some [self-care](https://apracticalwedding.com/pre-wedding-self-care-guide/). Taking care of ourselves is vital to enjoying the big day. Not only do we want to look our best but we want to feel our best too.
