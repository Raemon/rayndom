# UNIQUE WEDDINGS SPARKED BY BOUNDLESS IMAGINATION

The most unique weddings are sparked by imagination, not tradition. When you rent a yacht from FantaSea, your guests will be welcomed by the uniformed Captain and Crew and invited onboard the same way that they would board a luxury cruise. From there they can stroll our spacious decks, overlooking the marina with gorgeous 360-degree views. Wedding & Reception Planning is a breeze for you in the hands of true wedding professionals. Nearly four decades in the industry mean smooth sailing ahead for your unforgettable experience.

### AFTERNOON WEDDINGS

Afternoon cruising allows your guests to experience the full beauty of the Marina del Rey harbor. Glide through our tranquil waters and soak in the quaint seaside-inspired docks of colorful Fisherman’s Village and the hundreds of sailboats and luxury yachts cruising the main channel. Also enjoy the beautiful views of Santa Monica Bay and the Los Angeles coastline. Afternoon outings are calm, relaxed and the ideal setting for a brunch buffet or scenic lunch in the Harbor with family and friends.

You might also want to consider an afternoon [Spring wedding](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/spring-wedding-trends-marina-del-rey-yacht-weddings/) for the best weather and scenery.

### EVENING WEDDINGS

The sun has set, the stars are out, the music is soft and the champagne is flowing! Start your new lives together with an evening of elegance and style. There is nothing more romantic than a gorgeous nighttime soiree traveling across serene waters enjoying the twinkling lights from the Marina del Rey shore. Sunset and evening cruises extend an invitation for luxury and elegance. Whether it’s a black-tie affair or the ultimate Southern California experience on the water, we’ll provide the atmosphere for your perfect night.
