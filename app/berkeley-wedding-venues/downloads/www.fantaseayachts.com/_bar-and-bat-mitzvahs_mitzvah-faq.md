# THE BEST YACHTS FOR RENT IN THE MARINA ARE OPERATED BY FANTASEA YACHTS!

Browse the Bar Mitzvah venue FAQs below for answers to all of your bar-mitzvah bash needs:

### WILL I GET SEASICK?

Marina del Rey is a protected body of water in the largest man-made Marina in the United States. Our yachts travel through the tranquil harbor of Marina del Rey amongst 8.5 miles of scenic waterway where the scenic views of the Los Angeles coastline and Santa Monica Bay are breathtaking. There is virtually no risk of seasickness or motion sickness cruising these calm waters.

### WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR TAKING CARE OF ALL THE SET-UP AND DETAILS?

We are! All three of our elegant yachts for rent include comprehensive set-up prior to guest boarding.

### MANY OF OUR GUESTS ARE CHILDREN. ARE THEY SAFE ONBOARD?

We are a Coast Guard Certified Yacht Company, celebrating more than 40 years in the industry with a perfect safety record. We welcome children of all ages.

### IS THERE A SEPARATE AREA FOR ADULTS AND KIDS OR ARE THEY TOGETHER IN ONE ROOM?

Yes, there is ample room for the kids to sit separately or together with the other guests.

### CAN YOU ACCOMMODATE A CEREMONY?

Yes.

### WHAT DO I DO WITH GIFTS BROUGHT TO THE EVENT?

We set up a reception table and have one of your assigned relatives or friends receive your gifts. They are bagged later in the evening and are taken home with you at the end of your party.

### DO YOU PROVIDE KOSHER CATERING OR WORK WITH KOSHER CATERERS?

We work with a number of the top Los Angeles Kosher Caterers.

### WHEN DO WE OFFER OUR GUESTS FAVORS?

As a rule of thumb, on the table if it is edible, on the way out if it is not.

### HOW MANY EVENTS OCCUR AT ONE TIME?

The yacht is all yours for your Simcha. We do not share space.
