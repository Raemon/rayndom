We believe that we have the best yacht rentals Marina del Rey has to offer – but don’t take our word for it. Here is what some of our thousands of satisfied customers have to say about FantaSea Yachts.

  * So pleased with everything!! The views were stunning and Erin made our day run so smoothly. Her attention to detail only reinforced that she is a true professional in hospitality. I wouldn’t change a thing. Thank you for a memorable wedding day!

Ginger K. Sherman Oaks, CA

  * My wife and I got married here in sept 2014. It was amazing. Staff was Great. There is not one thing I could say bad about the experience. I knew as soon as I spoke to John that we had to get married on one of their boats. Everyone was so helpful with planning and setting up the evening. They even provided great vendors for DJ, Flowers, and photo which we used with great success.  
Our wedding was so nice its the bench mark for every wedding we have been to since. Every wedding we go to some will say “this wedding is nice, but it was not as nice as yours” our wedding was over 2 years ago and I still hear the same thing. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

Keep up the good work guys! Sorry it took so long Leroy Jethro Gibbs had to remind me to write a review. LOL.

Thanks again!

Chris M. Lake Balboa, Los Angeles, CA

  * The last 3 Decembers, I’ve fallen in love with FantaSea. I DJ’d a few corporate holiday parties here. I’ve also emceed two weddings here! wge-events.com if you’re inquiring for a DJ :-p

All the events I’ve done here, the venue gave me a hard cut-off time of 10:55pm. My clients knew that so it wasn’t a big deal. I like to keep the energy escalating a little past the end time giving my clients the option of overtime if they would like but It’s not possible at FantaSea. Still, its a 5 star service the crew here has always provided my clients. Not to mention I always get a yummy vendor meal :-p

Will G. Sherman Oaks, CA

  * We held my Mom’s 70th birthday here on 1028 and we had an amazing time. The boat was gorgeous, very clean, modern and elegant. The staff was extremely attentive and helpful. Our planner, Erin, was very helpful. She was flexible and accommodated all of my needs, and gave great advice given her experience. I would absolutely recommend this boat for any of your parties.

  * I have my 50th birthday party on October 27th 2017. Erin was my party planner she made sure everything ran smoothly I had no worries. The decorations were beautiful I had a gatsby-themed party. I wish I could name everyone who helped on the yacht. I had 130 guess on the DANDEANA yacht all my guests were attended to no problems. The food was delicious the drinks were great the service was fabulous. This is my second event what this company and they never seem to fail me. Thank you everyone who helped for me to have a grand 50th birthday even the ones behind the scenes I appreciate you all I’ll see you at my next event thank you everyone. Captain was great thank you Jeffrey for greeting everyone. The casino had on board was perfect my band was great my DJ was great. Thanks again I will never forget this day

Cynthia F. Cypress, CA

  * My aunt and uncle had their 50th wedding anniversary celebration on one of these yachts. it was a three level boat  
Entered on the bottom deck which was set up with couches and appetizers…took the stairs up to the next level which had a full hosted bar… then up to the 3rd deck where it was set up for seated dining. loved the layout! loved the trip around the bay…  
great place to host an event!

Shalini G. San Diego, CA

  * We had a birthday party onboard the Regency tonight. The entire crew were amazing. Francini was our director and made sure everything was set up and all of our needs were met. She was very kind, made sure everyone had a good time. She made herself available to all of our guests through the entire cruise.

I am from VB VA and would strongly recommend FantaSea Yachts  
Thank you to our entire crew for making our night a night to remember.

Jobel D.

  * What can I say except that this company provides excellence in everything that they do! I rarely find such genuine care and comfort from the beginning of the process to the end – I felt very taken care of and valued. In addition, the party was better than I expected! The service was amazing, the food was outstanding – I am still getting comments even months after – my guests are still telling me what a great time they had and asking when are we going to do it again! All of my guests (and me too) loved cruising into the sunset with cocktails and passed hors d’oeuvres on the sky deck, dining at dusk with the great cafe lighting that Asdruval Party Rentals provided and then dancing the night away to awesome music by Brad at Rhythm City!

This company provides the best of both worlds – old school care, like only a family business can provide AND top notch service and yachts – you can’t go wrong – this is definitely the best bang for your buck! Thank you FantaSea Yachts! Thank you Daniel & Stephanie, Jasmine and Erin, Captain Jeff, Mariano our Bartender and Mirsad the Event Manager and especially to Chef’s Eddie, Wilson and Ruben – the food was AMAZING! The party was epic and the memories are still fresh! FantaSea Yachts is a first class operation!

John W. Marina del Rey, CA

  * My cousins rented a Yacht for my Aunt’s 70th birthday party. We launched from Marina Del Ray and the boat did a loop around the marina for 5 hours. It goes by pretty fast especially since you’ll be enjoying dinner, entertainment, and when available, the open bar. The staff were amazing and the bartender kept up with all the orders with no hiccup. Years ago, my other cousin had a reception on another type of Yacht for their wedding reception. Maybe one day I’ll throw something on a Yacht and invite my closest friends. I think this is a better way to throw a special party than the usual land locked location.
