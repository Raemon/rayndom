## OUR CLIENTS SAY IT BEST

> We had a birthday party onboard the Regency tonight. The entire crew were amazing. Francini was our director and made sure everything was set up and all of our needs were met. She was very kind, made sure everyone had a good time. She made herself available to all of our guests through the entire cruise.

**Jobel D.** , Virginia Beach, VA

> What can I say except that this company provides excellence in everything that they do! I rarely find such genuine care and comfort from the beginning of the process to the end – I felt very taken care of and valued. In addition, the party was better than I expected! The service was amazing, the food was outstanding – I am still getting comments even months after – my guests are still telling me what a great time they had and asking when are we going to do it again! All of my guests (and me too) loved cruising into the sunset with cocktails and passed hors d’oeuvres on the sky deck, dining at dusk with the great cafe lighting that Asdruval Party Rentals provided and then dancing the night away to awesome music by Brad at Rhythm City!

**John W.** , Marina del Rey, CA

> My cousins rented a Yacht for my Aunt’s 70th birthday party. We launched from Marina Del Ray and the boat did a loop around the marina for 5 hours. It goes by pretty fast especially since you’ll be enjoying dinner, entertainment, and when available, the open bar. The staff were amazing and the bartender kept up with all the orders with no hiccup. Years ago, my other cousin had a reception on another type of Yacht for their wedding reception. Maybe one day I’ll throw something on a Yacht and invite my closest friends. I think this is a better way to throw a special party than the usual land locked location.

**Wes S.** , Ventura, CA

> I had my 50th birthday party on October 27th 2017. Erin was my party planner she made sure everything ran smoothly I had no worries. The decorations were beautiful I had a gatsby-themed party. I wish I could name everyone who helped on the yacht. I had 130 guess on the DANDEANA yacht all my guests were attended to no problems. The food was delicious the drinks were great the service was fabulous. This is my second yacht charter with this company and they never seem to fail me. Thank you everyone who helped for me to have a grand 50th birthday even the ones behind the scenes, I appreciate you all I’ll see you at my next event thank you everyone. Captain was great; thank you Jeffrey for greeting everyone. The casino on board was perfect, my band was great, my DJ was great. Thanks again I will never forget this day.

**Cynthia F.** , Cypress, CA

> We held my Mom’s 70th birthday here on 1028 and we had an amazing time. The boat was gorgeous, very clean, modern and elegant. The staff was extremely attentive and helpful. Our planner, Erin, was very helpful. She was flexible and accommodated all of my needs, and gave great advice given her experience. I would absolutely recommend this boat for any of your parties.

**Sonny S.** , Sepulveda, CA

> Fantasea hosted my mother’s ash scattering at sea earlier today and I could not have been happier with the results. The food and service were excellent! Kudos to Jasmine, Erin, Capt Luis, Capt Carlos, Mariano, Julio, Wilson and Francini for their wonderful team work! I highly recommend Fantasea!
