You’ve found your soul mate, set the date, and plan to say, “I do”, as you sail into the sunset. 

With the serene backdrop of Marina del Rey and the luxurious setting of a yacht, your **small yacht wedding** will leave a lasting impression on you and your guests.

Not sure how to get started? We’ve got you covered with six tips for planning an intimate yacht wedding.

## **1\. Choose Your Perfect Wedding Yacht Charter**

Let the fun begin! 

Selecting the right yacht is the foundation of planning a successful [wedding on a yacht.](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/weddings/) Consider the size of your guest list, the ambiance you envision, and the amenities you desire.

As you tour our yacht fleet, imagine your wedding day. Dreaming of open sky decks and ocean views? Planning on a small dance floor? Looking for space to offer a unique and fun experience like a whiskey tasting or cigar rolling? Considering a lounge area to connect and chat with guests?

FantaSea Yachts will take of it. 

Our [yachts are a blank canvas ](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/2019/11/05/yacht-party-options-marina-del-rey/)waiting to be painted in your vision. 

![The Dandeana holds up to 100 guests. ](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/FantaSea-Yachts-Dandeana-yacht-300x220.png)

From the [Dandeana](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/yachts/dandeana/) to [FantaSea One](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/yachts/fantasea-one/), every nook and cranny transforms to meet your needs. It’s just up to you to pick “the one.” We suggest scheduling a tour with one of our event professionals to walk you through each yacht, detail by detail. 

## **2\. Organize the Guest List**

You agreed on a [small yacht wedding](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/2019/12/03/yacht-party-planning-tips/), but how small is small? 

It’s essential to be on the same page. While small to you may be 100, your fiance may be thinking more along the lines of 30. Establishing a guest count early on does a few things: First, it sets the tone; second, it helps with your decision-making; and, last, it will influence many of your decisions and help you stay on track with wedding planning.

## **3\. A Picture is Worth a Thousand Memories**

Though loved ones will surround you on your special day, one guest will be just as important: your wedding photographer. 

This individual is responsible for capturing the most intimate, celebratory moments of this joyous occasion — moments to relive on your anniversary, to share with your children. Yes, it’s important that your photographer has a creative eye and takes stunning pictures, but it’s just as important that they are confident in their environment. 

![A small wedding on a yacht in Marina del Rey](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/small-wedding-on-a-yacht--300x220.png)

In this case, knowing how to photograph on a yacht, when to capture that sunset magic, and preparing for outdoor elements like a light wind from the ocean breeze. If you’re not sure where to begin, we have a list of vendors to help you get a jump start (and these pros know our yachts like the back of their hands to help you get the best shot).

Equally as important, discuss your vision and preferences with your photographer in advance to ensure they capture the essence and emotions of the day. Consider taking photos at various locations on the yacht and against the breathtaking backdrop of the California coastline.

## **4\. Money Matters**

It’s important to establish and stick to your budget. We know this can be a dreaded topic, but it’s one of the most important discussions to have as you set forth wedding planning. Establishing your [yacht wedding cost](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/weddings/pricing-and-packages/) early on will help identify your priorities. Is it entertainment? Decor? Flowers? WIth monies earmarked, you can confidently plan for your big day using your priorities as guideposts.

## **5\. Anchoring Love: The Yacht Ceremony and Vows**

The heart of your small yacht wedding lies in the ceremony and vows. Customize the ceremony to reflect your love story and create a meaningful experience for both you and your guests. 

![Wedding vows being performed on a FantaSea Yachts yacht](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wedding-vows-at-a-small-yacht-wedding-300x220.png)

Consider incorporating maritime-themed elements, such as a knot-tying ceremony or a symbolic toast to the sea. Write your own vows or collaborate with an officiant to create a script that truly captures the essence of your relationship.

## **6\. Repress Stress**

When planning a wedding, no matter how big or small, consider your time commitment and your patience level. 

You’re already making one of the biggest commitments of your life. Don’t make the planning of the big day any more stressful than it needs to be. 

That’s where we can help take the pressure down a level – or three. 

Do you have the bandwidth to source vendors or the energy to set up the day of your wedding? Don’t fret; that’s where a dedicated team of event professionals steps in. 

At FantaSea Yachts, we’re ready to serve. 

Need help with a DJ, band, or florist? We can recommend proven crowd-pleasers. Considering table linens? We’ll arrange for full table mock-ups to help you decide your best look. If you have your dream team of event professionals in mind, no problem! We’re happy to coordinate logistics on your behalf.  
  
Your wedding day will be a breeze with a dedicated planner — backed by an entire event team — to deal with the details. 

Translation: You won’t have to lift a finger. We take care of setup, from centerpieces and linens to gifts, cards, and party favors. We’ll even pack up your gifts for easy transport at the end of your yacht party reception.

And here’s one more perk to make your “to-do” list even easier — one of our Captains can officiate your ceremony! All of our Captains are ordained to perform wedding ceremonies by the [Universal Church of Life](https://www.ulc.org/).

## **Conclusion**

Planning a small yacht wedding is an opportunity to create a truly unique and unforgettable celebration. From choosing the perfect yacht to curating a remarkable experience for your guests, every detail contributes to the magic of the day. 

Whether you dream of an intimate ceremony surrounded by loved ones or a lively reception under the open sky, a yacht wedding offers a setting that combines elegance, sophistication, and the beauty of the sea.
