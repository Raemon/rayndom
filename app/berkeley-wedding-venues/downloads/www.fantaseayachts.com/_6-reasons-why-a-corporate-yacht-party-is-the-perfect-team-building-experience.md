A [corporate yacht party](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/corporate-events/) may not be the first thing that comes to mind when planning a team building experience, but it can be a unique and effective way to bring your team together. 

Some [studies](https://www.zippia.com/advice/workplace-collaboration-statistics/#:~:text=About%2075%25%20of%20employees%20rate,top%20reason%20for%20workplace%20failures.) have found that morale improves and employee turnover is reduced when employees do activities together.

This can translate into better working relationships once people return to the office.

## **4 – A LUXURY CORPORATE PARTY YACHT EXPERIENCE**

A yacht event can provide a sense of exclusivity and luxury. After all, they are typically considered the classic vip experience. Treating employees to a luxurious adventure on a yacht can make them feel valued and appreciated.
