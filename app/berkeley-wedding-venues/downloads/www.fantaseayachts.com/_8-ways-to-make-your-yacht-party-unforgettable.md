The guest list is set. Invites are set. RSVPs are rolling in.  
The excitement is buzzing for your next great soiree – and this time, that #yachtlife is calling. 

Yup, that’s right. You’re upping your [party planning game](https://www.hgtv.com/lifestyle/entertaining/our-fave-entertaining-ideas-v2-pictures) by hosting an unforgettable yacht party for your friends. 

But how do you make it an affair to remember? Our party planning experts know [how to throw a yacht party](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/4-reasons-why-a-company-party-on-a-yacht-is-a-genius-idea/). And our home base in Marina del Rey is just the place to do it. 

From [a company yacht party](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/corporate-events/) or [yacht wedding](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/weddings/) to family reunions or milestone birthday bashes, we know what it takes to host a fantastic party. The [yacht party rental venue](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/celebrations/) is only the first step.

What comes next? Read on to find out. 

## **1 – Set Your Theme**  


Hawaiian luau or rockstar punk? Roaring 20s or fiesta fun? Or do you prefer to keep it simple and focus on certain colors and hues? 

![yacht party theme](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/yacht-party-theme-300x220.png)

Whatever you decide, your theme will set the tone for your event. And a theme will help build your accents, decor, and other creative touches. Once you set the course, the fun is in the details.

## **2 – Music, Please**

Do your guests like to heat up the dance floor? Book a DJ that will get your crowd moving.   
  
Or is live music more your style? From large big bands to smaller trios, live entertainment can seamlessly take your event from dinner to dancing.

![yacht party entertainment](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/yacht-party-entertainment-300x220.png)

Also, consider your party’s theme when choosing music. A casual beach-themed party calls for laid-back surf jams while a black tie affair might prompt classic dance hits, 

If you’re building your own playlist, be sure to include crowd-pleasers and recommendations from your guests.

  
Music keeps the party moving – get grooving!

## **3 – Guest List**

Whether you’re hosting a big bash or intimate affair, determining a headcount right from the beginning will help ease the headache of unaccounted space issues and expenses. This will also help determine the best [yacht rental in Marina del Rey](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/yachts/) for your soiree — not to mention your budget!

## **4 – Special Entertainment**

There are so many ways to wow your guests. And nothing does the trick like specialty entertainment.  
  
Think cigar rolling, spirit tasting, poker tables, and lawn games like cornhole (we’ve held games on our FantaSea One skydeck!), all of which are popular ways to keep your guests smiling and buzzing with energy. 

Another extra special touch is to hire a performer like a comedian or a magician.   
  
The possibilities with a yacht party are endless.

## **5 – Say, Cheese!**

Having a professional photographer is one way to up the ante. Even better if they know how to photograph on a yacht. Capture that sunset magic and prepare for outdoor elements like a light wind from the ocean breeze

If you’re not sure where to begin, we have a list of vendors to help you get a jump start (and these pros know our yachts like the back of their hands to help you get the best shot).

## **6 – Signature Cocktails**

Personalize your yacht party with a signature cocktail. Is there an inside joke? A fun play on words that matches your theme? A preferred drink of choice by the host?  
  
Step it up, get creative and have fun with it. Specialty cocktails are a surefire way to get your guests buzzing.

## **7 – Get Social**

It’s so fun to see your guests having a good time – and in this day and age, there is a 99.9% chance your yacht party will end up on social media. So why not join the fun?  
  
Designate a hashtag for your event, [set up a selfie station](https://www.brides.com/gallery/selfie-stations-are-the-new-photo-booths), or host a photo booth to capture those memorable moments.

## **8 – Choose Your Yacht**

Selecting the right venue will set the tone for your yacht party. At FantaSea Yachts, you have the luxury (and flexibility) of choosing a yacht based on your needs and vision. From spacious rooftop decks to customizable spaces, we’re confident our luxury yachts are an unforgettable venue.

The largest of our fleet, [FantaSea One](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/yachts/fantasea-one/) is sure to WOW your guests. Its signature feature is an expansive rooftop which is often eyed for yacht weddings, corporate events, and sunset sails or moonlit cruises.
