Planning a wedding on a yacht is only one component of the complete wedding event. The wedding reception on a yacht is vital for keeping the party engaged and ongoing past sunset and into the night.

_There’s something undeniably romantic about exchanging vows as the sun dips below the horizon, painting the sky in shades of gold and pink while gentle waves lap against the hull of your private yacht. A yacht wedding isn’t just a ceremony—it’s an experience that transforms your special day into an unforgettable voyage._

For couples seeking a wedding venue that breaks free from the ordinary, a[ yacht wedding reception in Marina del Rey](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/yacht-weddings/) offers the perfect blend of elegance, intimacy, and adventure. Whether you’re envisioning an intimate gathering of your closest friends or a grand celebration with hundreds of guests aboard the largest private yacht in the marina, these 15 yacht wedding reception ideas will help you plan a waterfront wedding that your guests will talk about for years to come.

## **Setting the Scene: Ceremony & Timing Ideas**

### **Idea 1: Golden Hour Sunset Ceremonies**

The secret to breathtaking yacht wedding photos? Timing your ceremony to coincide with golden hour. As your yacht glides through Marina del Rey’s protected harbor, the setting sun creates a natural spotlight that bathes everything in warm, romantic light.

**How to make it work:**

  * Schedule your ceremony to begin approximately 30-45 minutes before sunset
  * In Los Angeles, the best sunset months are September and October, when skies are clearest
  * Position your altar facing west to capture the sun behind you as you say your vows
  * Work with your photographer to plan specific moments during the golden hour window



FantaSea’s yachts feature expansive upper decks with west-facing views—perfect for capturing that magical sunset backdrop. Our captains know exactly where to position the yacht for optimal lighting during your ceremony.

### **Idea 2: Starlit Evening Receptions Under the Open Sky**

Why end the magic at sunset? Extend your celebration into the evening and let the stars become part of your décor. There’s something incredibly romantic about dancing with your new spouse under a canopy of twinkling lights with the city skyline glittering in the distance.

**Evening reception advantages:**

  * Cooler temperatures for comfortable dancing
  * Dramatic lighting opportunities
  * Marina del Rey’s illuminated skyline as your backdrop
  * More intimate atmosphere as darkness falls



Marina del Rey’s protected harbor means smooth sailing even after dark, allowing your guests to enjoy the evening without worry. Our yachts feature both covered and open deck areas, giving you flexibility to create different atmospheres throughout the night.

## **Décor & Ambiance: Creating Your Waterfront Wedding Aesthetic**

### **Idea 3: Nautical-Elegant Centerpieces That Complement, Not Compete**

The ocean views from your yacht are stunning enough—your décor should enhance them, not distract from them. The key to nautical wedding décor is sophistication: think “elegant maritime” rather than “beach souvenir shop.”

**Centerpiece ideas that work beautifully on yachts:**

  * Glass hurricane lanterns filled with pillar candles and surrounded by smooth river rocks or white sand
  * Low arrangements of white roses, hydrangeas, and eucalyptus in clear glass vessels
  * Driftwood pieces accented with succulents and air plants
  * Mercury glass votives paired with single stems of garden roses
  * Brass telescopes or antique compasses as conversation-starting table accents



**Pro tip:** Keep centerpieces low. On a yacht, you want guests to see each other across the table and enjoy the views beyond. Tall arrangements block sightlines and can become unstable during cruising.

[![Floral yacht wedding centerpieces](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/FSY-Wedding-2024-FantaSea-One-258-Resized-1024x768.jpg) ](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/FSY-Wedding-2024-FantaSea-One-258-Resized.jpg)

### **Idea 4: Coastal Floral Arrangements Built for the Breeze**

Planning flowers for a yacht wedding requires some special consideration—you’re working with ocean breezes, salt air, and movement. The good news? Many of the most beautiful wedding flowers actually thrive in these conditions.

**Best flowers for yacht weddings:**

  * Roses (all varieties) – sturdy and timeless
  * Ranunculus – delicate-looking but surprisingly resilient
  * Peonies (in season) – romantic and full
  * Orchids – elegant and long-lasting
  * Eucalyptus and olive branches – perfect greenery that handles breeze well
  * Succulents – virtually indestructible and on-trend



**Avoid these on yachts:**

  * Tall, top-heavy arrangements that can tip
  * Delicate blooms like sweet peas that wilt quickly
  * Heavy floral scents that can cause discomfort on the water
  * Loose petals that scatter across decks



Work with a florist experienced in yacht weddings—our preferred vendors understand exactly how to create arrangements that stay beautiful throughout your celebration.

### **Idea 5: Ambient Lighting Magic on the Water**

Lighting transforms a yacht wedding from beautiful to absolutely magical. When the sun sets, your lighting design takes center stage, creating an atmosphere that’s simultaneously romantic, festive, and elegant.

**Yacht-friendly lighting options:**

  * **String lights:** Classic bistro lights crisscrossed across deck areas create instant ambiance
  * **Uplighting:** LED uplights along railings or architectural features add dramatic color
  * **Candles:** Battery-operated candles provide the flicker without fire risk (required on many yachts)
  * **Lanterns:** Hurricane lanterns with LED candles line walkways beautifully
  * **Pinspot lighting:** Highlight centerpieces and cake tables with focused beams



Our yachts come equipped with integrated lighting systems, and your wedding coordinator can help plan additional lighting that enhances without overwhelming. The goal is creating pools of warm light that invite guests to gather while maintaining the romance of the evening sky above.

## **Food & Beverage Excellence: Dining on the Water**

### **Idea 6: Seafood-Forward Menus That Celebrate Your Setting**

What better place to enjoy the ocean’s bounty than aboard a yacht cruising the harbor? A seafood-forward menu honors your setting while impressing guests with fresh, elegant dishes.

**Cocktail hour seafood stations:**

  * Raw bar featuring oysters, shrimp, and crab claws on ice
  * Tuna or salmon poke in individual cups
  * Ceviche shooters with citrus and cilantro
  * Smoked salmon canapés with crème fraîche



**Entrée inspirations:**

  * Pan-seared sea bass with champagne beurre blanc
  * Grilled lobster tails with drawn butter
  * Surf and turf featuring filet mignon and jumbo shrimp
  * Seared scallops with risotto and asparagus



**For non-seafood lovers:** Always include at least one chicken or vegetarian entrée option. A beautiful herb-roasted chicken breast or wild mushroom risotto ensures every guest enjoys their meal.

### **Idea 7: Signature Cocktails with a Nautical Twist**

Custom cocktails add personality to your yacht wedding while giving guests a memorable sipping experience. Create two signature drinks—one for each of you—and give them names that tell your story.

**Yacht-worthy cocktail ideas:**

“Marina Sunset” – Vodka, passion fruit, champagne, and a sugar rim with edible glitter

“The Captain’s Toast” – Premium rum, coconut cream, fresh lime, and a sprig of mint

“Pacific Romance” – Gin, elderflower liqueur, cucumber, and a touch of blue curaçao

“Anchor’s Aweigh” – Bourbon, honey, lemon, and a thyme sprig

Don’t forget mocktails! Offer sophisticated non-alcoholic options like sparkling elderflower lemonade or virgin mojitos so every guest can toast to your happiness.

### **Idea 8: Interactive Food Stations That Become Entertainment**

Food stations do double duty at yacht weddings—they feed your guests and give them something engaging to do between dancing. Watching skilled chefs prepare food to order is both delicious and entertaining.

Popular yacht wedding food stations include sushi rolling stations where a sushi chef creates custom rolls before guests’ eyes, carving stations with prime rib or ham carved fresh with au jus, pasta stations with made-to-order pasta and choice of sauces, slider bars with mini burgers and pulled pork, and dessert stations featuring mini pastries or a chocolate fountain.

Stations encourage mingling and work especially well during cocktail hour while the yacht departs the marina. Guests can sample and socialize while taking in the views from deck.

## **Yacht Entertainment & Guest Experience: Making Memories**

### **Idea 9: Live Music That Enhances the Maritime Atmosphere**

The acoustics on a yacht are unique—you’re working with open air, engine sounds, and conversation. The right music enhances your celebration without overwhelming the space.

For your ceremony, consider a string quartet or acoustic guitar for elegance and intimacy. During cocktail hour, a jazz trio or solo pianist provides sophisticated background music. For the reception, a full band or DJ positioned for optimal sound gets everyone dancing.

Acoustic music carries beautifully over water, while amplified music needs careful positioning. Consider the timing of your sets—upbeat music works when docked, softer sounds while cruising.

[![Dancing at a yacht wedding](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/FSY-Wedding-2024-FantaSea-One-272-Resized-683x1024.jpg) ](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/FSY-Wedding-2024-FantaSea-One-272-Resized.jpg)

### **Idea 10: Dance Floor Under the Stars**

There’s something magical about your first dance aboard a yacht—the city lights twinkling in the distance, the gentle movement of the water, and the knowledge that you’re celebrating in a truly unique venue.

FantaSea’s larger yachts, including[ FantaSea One](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/fantasea-one/), feature dedicated dance floor areas with room for the entire wedding party. LED dance floors can be brought aboard for dramatic effect, and dancing feels best when docked or in calm waters.

Classic first dance songs that work beautifully on yachts include “Beyond the Sea” by Bobby Darin, “At Last” by Etta James, “Can’t Help Falling in Love” by Elvis Presley, and “The Way You Look Tonight” by Frank Sinatra.

### **Idea 11: Photo Opportunities from Bow to Stern**

A yacht wedding gives your photographer locations that no land venue can match. From sunrise getting-ready shots to sunset ceremonies to sparkler exits against the city lights, every moment offers stunning possibilities.

Best photo locations on FantaSea yachts include the bow for romantic shots with open water behind you, upper deck for panoramic views of Marina del Rey, spiral staircases for dramatic bridal portraits, the captain’s wheel for fun playful couple shots, and the stern for sunset and skyline backgrounds.

Drone photography captures your yacht from above—coordinate with your captain for timing. Work with a photographer experienced in yacht weddings who knows how to use natural light, handle the movement, and capture moments unique to your waterfront celebration.

## **Unique Yacht Wedding Touches**

### **Idea 12: Champagne Toast as You Set Sail**

Time your champagne toast to coincide with departure for a moment your guests will never forget. As the yacht pulls away from the dock and Marina del Rey opens up before you, raise your glasses to the adventure ahead.

Have servers ready with filled glasses as departure time approaches. The best man or maid of honor can begin the toast as the yacht moves. Position yourselves where guests can see both you and the departing shoreline.

Sparkling wine options range from true French Champagne for ultimate luxury, to California sparkling wine for excellent quality at lower cost, Italian Prosecco for a lighter option, or sparkling rosé for a romantic pink-hued toast.

[![Eating at a yacht wedding reception](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/FSY-Wedding-2024-FantaSea-One-254-Resized-1024x688.jpg) ](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/FSY-Wedding-2024-FantaSea-One-254-Resized.jpg)

### **Idea 13: Private Deck Moments for the Happy Couple**

Even at your own wedding, sometimes you need a moment alone together. Yacht weddings offer unique opportunities for private interludes that land venues simply can’t provide.

Reserve a private deck area for a “sweetheart moment” between ceremony and reception. Schedule a 15-minute break where you and your new spouse can watch the sunset together. Use the yacht’s multiple levels to slip away for a quiet breath before cake cutting.

For your sweetheart table setup, position it facing outward for best views, drape with luxe linens and extra florals, add personal touches like photos from your relationship, and ensure comfortable seating—you’ll want to linger.

### **Idea 14: Send-Off Spectacular That’s Yacht-Safe**

The send-off moment deserves something special—but traditional sparklers and open flames may not be permitted on every yacht. Fortunately, there are plenty of dramatic alternatives.

Yacht-approved send-off ideas include glow sticks that guests wave as you depart, LED sparklers with all the shimmer and none of the fire risk, ribbon wands streaming in your wedding colors, bubbles that look elegant lit by deck lights, and biodegradable confetti cannons (check with yacht coordinator first).

Coordinate with your captain for exact docking time, have your coordinator distribute send-off items 10 minutes before departure, and position your photographer for optimal angles.

## **Planning Your Yacht Wedding: Choosing the Perfect Vessel**

### **Idea 15: Selecting the Right Yacht for Your Guest Count**

The most important decision for your yacht wedding is choosing a vessel that fits your guest count comfortably. Too small, and guests feel crowded; too large, and the atmosphere feels empty.

**FantaSea Yachts Fleet for Weddings:**

[**FantaSea One**](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/fantasea-one/) accommodates 250-300 guests—best for grand celebrations and large wedding parties. Features multiple decks, spacious dance floor, and several bars. This is the largest private charter yacht in Marina del Rey.

[**Regent Sea**](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/regentsea/) hosts up to 135 guests—best for medium-sized weddings with room to spread out. Features elegant interior and open upper deck. Perfect balance of intimacy and space.

[**Dandeana**](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/dandeana/) accommodates 100-130 guests—best for intimate celebrations with close family and friends. Features classic yacht feel and cozy atmosphere. Ideal for couples who want everyone close.

When choosing the right fit, plan for 80% of invited guests (standard RSVP rate), consider standing cocktail hour vs. seated dinner needs, think about dance floor space requirements, and factor in vendor staff who will also be aboard.

## **FAQs About Yacht Weddings**

### **How much does a yacht wedding cost in Los Angeles?**

Yacht wedding costs in Los Angeles typically range from $5,000 to $25,000+ depending on guest count, yacht size, and package inclusions. FantaSea Yachts offers customizable wedding packages starting with smaller intimate gatherings on the Dandeana (100-130 guests) to grand celebrations on FantaSea One accommodating up to 300 guests. Pricing includes the yacht charter, captain, and crew, with catering, décor, and entertainment available as add-ons. Contact our wedding specialists for a personalized quote based on your vision.

### **How many guests can fit on a yacht for a wedding?**

Guest capacity varies by yacht. FantaSea Yachts offers options for every wedding size: the Dandeana accommodates 100-130 guests, the Regent Sea hosts up to 135 guests, and FantaSea One—the largest private yacht in Marina del Rey—welcomes 250-300 guests. We recommend choosing a yacht that allows comfortable movement for dining, dancing, and mingling throughout your reception.

### **What is the best time of year for a yacht wedding in California?**

Southern California offers year-round yacht wedding possibilities, but the most popular months are April through October when weather is warmest and most predictable. September and October offer beautiful sunset lighting and comfortable temperatures without peak summer crowds. Winter months (November-March) can offer dramatic skies and more competitive pricing, though some events may stay dockside due to weather conditions. According to[ The Knot’s wedding planning guide](https://www.theknot.com/content/best-time-to-get-married), fall weddings have become increasingly popular nationwide.

### **Can you have a wedding ceremony on a yacht?**

Yes! You can have both your ceremony and reception aboard a yacht. FantaSea Yachts regularly hosts complete weddings with ceremonies performed on the upper deck as the yacht cruises Marina del Rey. The captain can perform the ceremony, or you can bring your own officiant. Many couples choose a sunset ceremony timing for golden-hour photography before transitioning into their reception celebration.

### **What happens if the weather is bad on my yacht wedding day?**

FantaSea Yachts operates in Marina del Rey’s protected harbor, which offers calmer waters than open ocean venues. Our yachts feature enclosed climate-controlled interior spaces as backup in case of inclement weather. In rare cases of severe weather, we work with couples to reschedule or modify the experience. We recommend discussing weather contingency plans with our wedding coordinators during the planning process.

### **What should guests wear to a yacht wedding?**

Yacht wedding attire typically falls between cocktail and formal, often described as “nautical chic” or “elegant resort.” Women commonly wear flowing dresses or dressy jumpsuits, while men opt for dress shirts with slacks or suits without ties. We recommend guests bring a light jacket or wrap since evening ocean breezes can be cool. Flat or wedge shoes are preferable to stilettos for easier movement on deck.

### **Is seasickness a concern for yacht wedding guests?**

Marina del Rey’s protected harbor provides calm cruising conditions, making seasickness rare for most guests. Our yachts feature stabilization systems and remain in smooth harbor waters rather than venturing into open ocean. For guests with sensitivity, we recommend they avoid heavy meals before boarding and stay on upper decks where fresh air is readily available. Over-the-counter remedies can also provide peace of mind. Learn more about[ Marina del Rey’s protected harbor](https://visitmarinadelrey.com/).

### **Can we bring our own vendors for a yacht wedding?**

FantaSea Yachts welcomes couples to bring their own photographers, DJs, florists, and other vendors aboard. We have a preferred vendor list of professionals experienced with yacht events, but you’re not required to use them. Your wedding coordinator can help ensure outside vendors understand yacht logistics, load-in procedures, and any equipment requirements specific to maritime venues.

### **How long does a typical yacht wedding reception last?**

Most yacht wedding charters are 4-5 hours, which allows ample time for the ceremony (if held aboard), cocktail hour, dinner service, toasts, dancing, and special moments. The yacht departs from the dock, cruises Marina del Rey during dinner, and returns for final dancing and farewells. Longer charters can be arranged for couples wanting extended celebrations or additional harbor touring time.

### **What’s included in a yacht wedding package?**

FantaSea Yacht wedding packages typically include the private yacht charter, experienced captain and crew, event coordination assistance, basic setup, and use of the yacht’s sound system. Catering can be arranged through our preferred caterers or brought aboard from approved outside vendors. Décor, flowers, photography, entertainment, and other services are available as add-ons or through your own vendors. Each wedding is customized to the couple’s specific vision and budget.[ View our yacht wedding packages](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/yacht-weddings/) for more details.
