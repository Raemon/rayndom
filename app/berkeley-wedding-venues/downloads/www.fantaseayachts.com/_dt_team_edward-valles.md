# Edward Valles

![](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/eddie-valles-242x300.jpg) Captain of the kitchen, Chef Edward Valles, joined FantaSea Yachts in 2000 as a Sous Chef, but quickly climbed the culinary ladder to the Executive Chef position. Chef Edward’s natural inclination to make every guest happy and at ease with their menu, makes his simple and comfortable approach to fine dining the perfect accompaniment to every FantaSea event.

As Executive Chef for sea venues, “Chef Eddie” is often faced with challenges not typical for a restaurant chef. Chef Eddie rises to the challenges and among his many accomplishments are a sit-down dinner for 700 guests, aboard three boats, off the coast of Catalina and a dinner for 500 guests in FantaSea’s land and sea facilities simultaneously. With FantaSea’s diverse clientele, he is frequently asked to develop customized menus for events reflecting the cultural heritage of his guests. This has allowed him to prepare and showcase the exotic cuisines of Egypt, Cuba, Morocco, Armenia, Russia, and Spain. Items on Chef Eddie’s eclectic and extensive menu changes annually and reflect these influences.

Chef Eddie developed an appreciation for the culinary arts at an early age in his hometown of San Pedro, California, a community where the local fare is heavily influenced by the Italians, Hispanics, and Croatians who reside there. His godfather, also a chef, and his grandmother, an excellent cook, recognized his natural talent in the kitchen and encouraged him to pursue his passion at Los Angeles Trade Technical College; where he received his degree in culinary arts in 1996.

Prior to joining FantaSea, Chef Eddie trained under acclaimed Chef Rasinouz at the Ritz Carlton in Laguna Nigel and he continued to hone his skills as the Senior Sous Chef at Chez Melange, a critically-acclaimed, upscale bistro in Redondo Beach, California.

Chef Eddie, who catered his own wedding reception at FantaSea’s Yacht in 2008, knows firsthand the quality of service that FantaSea provides and proudly intends to continue to provide this level of service for many years to come.
