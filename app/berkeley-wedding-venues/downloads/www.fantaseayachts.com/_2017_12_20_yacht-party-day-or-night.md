Having a yacht party is a great way to make your bash stand out from the rest. From the breathtaking views and first-class service to the simple fact that you’re aboard a yacht, there are many unique characteristics.

One of the stark differences from a typical event venue is that, once aboard, you’ll enjoy a beautiful cruise on the water–an exciting feature for our clients and their guests. Depending on the time of day, your celebration can bask in the famous Southern California sunshine or sparkle under the night stars. [Yacht parties offer a lot of flexibility](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/celebrations/) making them an ideal choice for almost any occasion.

This leads to a question we often hear from our clients: Should we hold our event during the day or at night?

While both have their advantages, there are a few questions to consider first.

### **How formal is it?**

Evaluate the scope of your event. Do you envision [cocktail dresses](https://www.miabellacouture.com/collections/evening-dresses) and sharp suits? Formal gowns and classic tuxedos? Then your event is best suited for the evening.

If you’re opting for a more casual feel with a bright, airy vibe then daytime is probably best.

A general rule of thumb is that formal events (e.g. weddings, Bar/Bat Mitzvahs, proms, [corporate galas](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/corporate-events/), etc.) are planned in the evening while lighter celebrations (e.g. family reunions, baby and bridal showers, engagement and graduation parties, etc.) occur during the day.

### **Who’s invited?**

Scan your guest list and get a sense of the invitees.

Are they early birds? Night owls? Are their weekends filled with work shifts and kid’s soccer games? If you answered “yes,” then a night yacht party will most likely be preferred.

If the group is a little more flexible (i.e. not tied to a specific schedule) then a midday jaunt will probably work just fine.

### **What’s on the menu?**

Decide what you plan to serve your guests. If you’re feeling a three-course sit down dinner complete with bread service and passed hors d’oeuvres, the evening is more appropriate.

Daytime events are a little more comfortable and often call for a more casual setting featuring a fantastic buffet or a gorgeous brunch spread. Either way, food is a MUST for any event and should be served accordingly.

### **Sunset, stars or sunny skies?**

Many clients consider the gorgeous backdrop of the Marina del Rey harbor as an enhanced feature of their event. In this case, clients look forward to a spectacular sunset for amazing photos while others rely on the twinkling lights of the harbor and stars to add a romantic feel.

Our daytime clients really emphasize the sights on the water and enjoy the incomparable views of the Los Angeles coastline–from Catalina Island and the Palos Verdes peninsula all the way to Malibu. Daytime events are also fun for spotting wildlife and seeing other yachts in the harbor.

A nighttime yacht party will have a different vibe. Depending on the nature of your celebration, dancing and socializing might be more like dancing at a nightclub. Alternatively, for smaller celebrations, the night sky is the perfect backdrop for a luxurious and intimate experience.

Your choices depend on what your goal is. What do you want to experience with your guests?

## Frequently Asked Questions: Day vs Night Yacht Parties

### Q: What are the main differences between day and night yacht parties?

A: Day parties offer bright, airy vibes with stunning coastal views, while night parties provide a more formal atmosphere with twinkling lights and starry skies. The choice often depends on the event type, guest preferences, and desired ambiance.

### Q: Which types of events are better suited for daytime yacht parties?

A: Daytime yacht parties are often ideal for more casual events such as family reunions, baby showers, bridal showers, engagement parties, and graduation celebrations. These events benefit from natural lighting and scenic daytime views.

### Q: What kinds of events work best for evening yacht parties?

A: Evening yacht parties are typically better for formal events like weddings, Bar/Bat Mitzvahs, proms, corporate galas, and other celebrations that call for a more sophisticated atmosphere. The nighttime setting lends itself well to elegant attire and romantic lighting.

### Q: How does the menu differ between day and night yacht parties?

A: Daytime events often feature more casual dining options like buffets or brunch spreads. Evening events are more suited to formal dining experiences, such as three-course sit-down dinners with bread service and passed hors d’oeuvres.

### Q: Can I have a party that spans both day and night?

A: Yes, depending on the duration of your event, you could potentially experience both day and night on your cruise. This could allow you to enjoy the best of both worlds – daytime views and nighttime ambiance. Discuss this option with our event planners.

### **Still Not Sure?**

Consider how you want your event to look. For example, enchancements like lighting will produce different looks depending on the time of day. Did you want to do special uplighting? A gobo on the dance floor or on the side of the yacht? If yes, then maybe an evening event is best.

If you have specific colors or a theme you want to feature, then consider whether or not a daylight or an evening yacht party will complement your color palette. Did you want to use glow sticks on the dance floor or have sparklers for your grand exit once the yacht docks? Or did you want to keep it simple with natural lighting? These are all questions that will help determine when to hold your event.

Remember, you can customize every aspect of your **yacht party** to create the exact experience you’re looking for. Our expert planners are here to make the process effortless.

We hope this information helped guide you in the right direction with your event planning. For additional details, please call 310-827-2220 or click [here](/contact/) to submit an event query form.
