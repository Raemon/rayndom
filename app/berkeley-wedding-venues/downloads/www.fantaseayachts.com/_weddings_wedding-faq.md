# Questions?

Need more details about hosting your wedding on a FantaSea Yacht? Browse the questions and answers below. If you have a question that isn’t answered below, [**contact us**](/contact/)!

### WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR TAKING CARE OF ALL THE SET-UP AND DETAILS?

We are! We take care of all the yacht party set-up prior to guest boarding.

### ARE CHILDREN ALLOWED?

We welcome children of all ages.

### CAN WE BE MARRIED BY THE CAPTAIN?

All of our Captains are ordained to perform wedding ceremonies by the Universal Church of Life.

### WHAT SHOULD I KNOW ABOUT GETTING A MARRIAGE LICENSE?

You will need to bring your license with you on the day of your wedding for the officiant to sign before you send it in to be recorded.

### CAN MY GUESTS THROW RICE OR ROSE PETALS DURING THE RECESSIONAL?

Unfortunately, no. We work hard to leave a minimal footprint on the environment, so we have a few alternative ideas for you, just ask!

### WHAT DO I DO WITH GIFTS BROUGHT TO THE WEDDING?

We set-up a reception table and have one of your assistants receive your gifts. They are bagged later in the evening and are taken home with you at the end of your [yacht party reception.](/2019/12/03/yacht-party-planning-tips/)

### WHEN DO WE OFFER OUR GUESTS FAVORS?

As a rule of thumb – on the table if it is edible, on the way out if it is not.

### WHAT IS NEEDED TO SECURE A YACHT FOR MY WEDDING?

We just need a signed contract and deposit.

### HOW FAR IN ADVANCE SHOULD I BOOK MY DESIRED YACHT?

Some of our [yacht weddings](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/weddings/wedding-planning/) book more than a year in advance, others book 3-6 months in advance. The sooner you book, the greater the chance of getting your favored date selection.

### IS PARKING AVAILABLE FOR OUR GUESTS?

Yes, there is easy public parking close to the yachts.

### DOES EACH YACHT HAVE A BRIDAL SUITE?
