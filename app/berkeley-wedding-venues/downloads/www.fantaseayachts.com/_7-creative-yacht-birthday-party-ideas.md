Birthdays come once a year… but the memories can last a lifetime. Celebrate your next trip around the sun with a [yacht birthday party](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/celebrations/birthdays/) at FantaSea Yachts.  
  
We’ve been doing [yacht rentals for birthdays](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/plan-a-sensational-yacht-birthday-party-in-5-easy-steps/) and other events for over 42+ years. With beautiful Marina del Rey as our home base, our cruises offer exceptional service, a one-of-a-kind experience, and gorgeous views of the Southern California coastline.  
  
We’ve got you covered! If phrases like “[yacht party rentals Los Angeles](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/celebrations/),” or “yachts for birthday parties” ring a bell then look no further. Our luxury yacht fleet is ready to host your [birthday party on a yacht](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/corporate-events/holiday-parties/) with friends and family members from near or far away from home. 

Our experienced team of event planning professionals will be at your side to plan the birthday bash of the year.   
  
One tip our event planners often share is to consider a theme for your party. From cakes and decor to signature cocktails and party favors, themes are an excellent way to customize your party.   
  
Get inspired with these seven **yacht birthday party ideas**. 

## 1\. Roaring 20s

Break out the flappers, crank up the jazz, and don your best Gatsby attire. The [roaring 20s](https://www.automobiledrivingmuseum.org/1920s-theme-party/) is always a crowd pleaser!   
  
Travel back in time with your friends – don’t forget the feathered headdress, pearls, and pinstripes – and pay homage to one of the most buzzed-about decades of the 20th century.

![20s themed yacht birthday party](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/roaring-20s-yacht-birthday-party-300x220.png)

Enjoy sipping on gimlets or perhaps set up a speakeasy-inspired bar. Work with our staff to craft your signature drink. There are so many fun ways to bring back the 20s.

## 2\. Fiesta Fun

Everybody loves a fiesta. Even better when it’s yours!  
  
One of the perks of having a fiesta-themed [yacht party](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/8-ways-to-make-your-yacht-party-unforgettable/) is the decor. From [papel picado ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papel_picado)and maracas to vibrant colors, talavera, and bold accents, there are so many ways to play up the fiesta theme.   
  
Take it up a level by serving delicious fiesta fare. Quesadillas, taquitos, shots of tortilla soup, and elote are delectable dishes that also make great appetizers. 

Be serenaded by mariachis as you dance under the stars.

![Mexican themed yacht party](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Mexican-themed-yacht-party-300x220.png)

At the end of the night, surprise your guests with a taco service for the post-party treat they didn’t know they needed. Fiesta, fiesta, fiesta!

## 3\. Disco Fever

Cue Staying Alive. Channel your inner Donna Summer. Break out the disco ball. The [70s are back!](https://asubtlerevelry.com/70s-theme-party/)

Partygoers can dance the night away to the biggest hits from the grooviest decade. All while sporting their best 70s attire. Time to break out those flared pants, feathered hair extensions and some high-stepping platform shoes!

![disco themed yacht party](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/disco-themed-yacht-party-300x220.png)

Whether retro, flashy, or funky, 70s costumes are sure to be righteous.

Lava lamps, beaded curtains, smoke machines, and strobe lighting are great additions to your party decor.  
  
Throw in a dash of the most popular colors of the decade – purple, orange, brown – to top off that 70s flair.

## 4\. White Party

There’s something about a white party that presents an irresistible lure. Perhaps it’s the ease of outfit planning. The pristine photo ops. Or that VIP feeling comes with being dressed head to toe in such an elegant color.   
  
Guests LOVE a white party.  
  
And we love planning them.  
  
From linens and flowers to decor and other creative twists, our luxury yachts are the perfect setting to customize your event.

![White party on a yacht](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/White-party-on-a-yacht-300x220.png)

Trust us when we say that a white party never goes out of style. 

## 5\. Yacht Rock

Get ready to rock.  
  
Get ready to rock to chart-topping hits from the late 70s and early 80s as you cruise to the sounds of Hall & Oats, The Doobie Brothers, Chicago, Steely Dan, Toto… and that’s just the first half hour.   
  
Guests will have fun with their attire. Anything goes, from flipped-out polo collars, boat shoes, and white shorts to Captain’s hats and their favorite pair of shades. For a flashier ensemble, channel your inner Miami Vice vibes. 

Yacht Rock. It’s one of our favorite combos.

## 6\. Masquerade Ball

Add a little mystery to your party with a masquerade ball.   
  
Feathered masks, jewel tones, and elaborate make-up will up the ante.

![mas](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/masquerade-party-on-a-yacht-300x220.png)

Dress the yacht with candelabras, chandeliers, drapes, and lanterns to add some sparkle.

A masquerade ball is also the perfect setting for a murder mystery game or scavenger hunt. And the perfect activity for your guests to lean into the theme.

Don’t forget the photo booth to capture the glamorous costumes and dazzling allure. Along with a professional photographer on board, opt for a shimmering backdrop with streamers and props.   
  
Come one, come all!  


**Nautical Charm in a Yacht Birthday Party**

When throwing a yacht party, a nautical theme tops the list for many reasons. It’s fitting, charming, and makes the most of your [party yacht rental](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/celebrations/) experience – ahoy!

Think navy stripes, captain hats, and gold accents. Guests will enjoy a nautical-themed adventure as they take in glimmering ocean views and a cool, coastal breeze.   


### Welcome aboard, mate!
