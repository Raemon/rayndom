A party yacht is a unique and impressive venue that can help you make a lasting impression on your guests. Whether you’re hosting a client appreciation event or the [perfect team-building experience](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/6-reasons-why-a-corporate-yacht-party-is-the-perfect-team-building-experience/), a [corporate event on a party yacht](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/corporate-events/) can help you create a unique experience that your guests won’t soon forget. 

### **What is a corporate party?**

Typically held in a traditional office setting, hotel or conference center, corporate events are meant to evoke collaboration and team bonding. Unfortunately, these types of events can become cliche or disingenuous when the event lacks imagination or effort. Don’t put your corporate event on autopilot.

At FantaSea Yachts, we’ve hosted thousands of corporate events including business mixers, luncheons, sunset cocktail cruises, incentive programs and organizational celebrations. There is no better place than Marina del Rey to book a yacht party rental and to sit back, relax, and toast your teammates.

Still not sure if your company will be impressed? Here are 8 reasons why your next corporate event should be on the water.

## 1\. Unforgettable Corporate Event Experiences on the Water

Party yachts offer a unique setting for corporate events. Unlike traditional venues, yachts provide stunning views of the surrounding water and a unique sense of adventure that is sure to impress your guests. 

Marina del Rey is known for its calm waters and natural beauty. It is also home to plenty of marine wildlife including dolphins!

## 2\. Exclusive and Private Setting

One of the biggest advantages of hosting a corporate event on a party yacht is the exclusive and private setting it provides. 

From the moment you step onto the yacht, the entire space is yours. No sharing the wall with another event; no confusion with the meeting down the hall and no risk of a stranger (aka crasher) disrupting your event. 

Our yachts are not only private and secure, but offer ample space and the flexibility to customize the area to fit your needs — no matter if it’s a full-scale corporate bash or a smaller, more intimate affair.

This means that you can focus on your event and ensure that your guests have a comfortable and enjoyable experience. Plus, the privacy of a party yacht also allows for confidential conversations and meetings to take place in a secure environment.

Incorporate the yacht experience into your creative process.**

## 3\. Flexible Event Spaces

Our yachts are designed to accommodate a wide range of events, from intimate gatherings to large-scale corporate events. 

We have three yachts in our fleet: the [Dandeana](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/yachts/dandeana/), [FantaSea One](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/yachts/fantasea-one/) and the [Admiral XL](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/yachts/admiral-xl/). Depending on which yacht you choose, we offer a variety of event spaces, including indoor and outdoor areas, that can be customized to meet your specific needs. 

Whether you’re hosting a cocktail party, a team-building exercise, or a formal dinner, a party yacht can provide the flexibility and versatility you need to create a successful event space.

## **4\. Dedicated Event Planner and Service**

Booking your yacht party with FantaSea Yachts means that you’ll have a dedicated event planner every step of the way AND a five-star hospitality crew experienced in private **LA yacht charters**. 

True story: we’re experts at turning your ideas into reality. 

A couple of years back, one of our clients was intrigued by the notion of hosting a promotional event on the water. However, our client was also apprehensive and likely a little overwhelmed. Fortunately, after an in depth brainstorming session with the client, we were able to alleviate their concerns and provide a comprehensive breakdown of how the event would unfold.

Dreaming up a themed party? We can help with that, too. We’ve seen and done it all from beach-themed bashes and masquerade balls to winter wonderland holiday parties and tech-focused events — not to mention popular activities like whiskey tastings, cigar stations and cornhole.

## 5\. Professional Catering and Service

Another advantage of hosting a **corporate event on a party yacht** is the professional catering and service that is available. At FantaSea Yachts we have experienced chefs and service staff on board who can provide high-quality food and drinks that are tailored to your event. This means that you can focus on your guests and the event itself, while the yacht’s staff takes care of the rest.

Memorable and Impressive Impressions; you’ll be showing your guests that you value their experience and are willing to go the extra mile to create an unforgettable event.

## 6\. Budget Flexibility with a Party Yacht Rental

Having a firm handle on your budget will help to successfully achieve your event goals. We’re by your side to solidify your budget, determine the scope of your event, and discuss options, from entertainment to menu. [Yacht party prices](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/corporate-events/cost/) are customized based on your event parameter.

## 7\. Unwind and Relax on a Party Yacht

For many people, being on a party yacht can be a welcome break from the stress and routine of the office. The sound of the waves, the sea breeze, and the beautiful scenery can create a sense of calm and relaxation that can help to reduce anxiety and improve mental wellbeing.

Hosting a corporate event on a yacht can provide a unique opportunity for attendees to enjoy these benefits. It can be a chance for them to take a break from their work and other responsibilities, and to focus on themselves for a while. 

This can have a positive impact on their overall job satisfaction and productivity, as people return to work feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. Additionally, it can help to create a positive association between your company and the experience of relaxation and wellbeing, which can be beneficial for your brand image and reputation.

Make impressing your team part of your employee retention strategy.

## 8\. The Location for Los Angeles Team Building Events

We’re located four miles north of [LAX](https://www.flylax.com/), making it easy for satellite employees to hop on a plane, jump in a cab and participate with the rest of the team. Who needs Skype or Zoom when you have a direct line to an accessible international airport?
