We love a good party. But then again, who doesn’t!

At FantaSea Yachts, we’ve had the privilege to host some pretty amazing parties aboard our Marina del Rey yacht fleet. After all, we’ve been in the party planning business for 42 years; it’s safe to say that our yachts (and event team) have seen (and done) it all.

From splashy soirees and decked-out theme parties to intimate celebrations and milestone moments, there’s nothing like [hosting your party on a yacht](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/celebrations/).

But party planners beware—there are some questions you should ask before renting a party yacht to make sure it’s the right fit for your party (and vice versa). From party size to location, here are five questions to consider (and answer) before stepping onto our luxury party yachts.

## **1 – How many people do I want to invite?**

It’s always a good idea to tour the yacht (yes, we offer virtual appointments!) to get a sense of space. The size of your guest list will determine your options. It will also help you plan your event flow and envision all those picture-perfect details that will showcase your signature flair. 

A smaller yacht is perfect for family gatherings, a group of friends, or any type of intimate event. Mid-sized yachts and mega-yachts are great for accommodating corporate parties, weddings, dinner cruises, and other larger events.

You should also get a sense of whether there are any specific dietary needs of your guests. Let your event planner know if there are allergy restrictions to be aware of or if a large part of your guests are vegan or have some specific foods that they either must have or avoid.

Fantasea Yachts is unique in that there are three, five-star yachts to choose from to accommodate events of almost every size.

  * Admiral XL – Our most intimate luxury yacht accommodating up to 12 guests.
  * Dandeana – Our spectacular mid-sized yacht that holds up to 130 guests.
  * Fantasea One – Our flagship yacht housing up to 300 guests with space to spread out and truly enjoy the majesty of sailing the open seas.



Once you have an idea of **yacht accommodations** , you’re one step closer to smooth sailing. 

## **2 – What is included with my party yacht rental?**

It’s important to know what you’re signing up for. Does the rental include a dedicated event team? (hint: it’s one of our signature offerings) Catering? Harbor or ocean cruise? What is the general time block – two, four, six hours? 

Be sure to get the breakdown so you can optimize your event!

The level of intimacy will be determined by what type of event you’re hosting. A birthday, anniversary, or retirement party will most likely include personalized touches geared to the person or persons of honor. 

If the event is a birthday party and the guest of honor is a baseball fanatic, you may consider choosing ballpark-themed cuisine like hot dogs and pizza.

On the other hand, if celebrating a 50-year wedding anniversary and the couple’s first date was at a steakhouse, you may work with the event planner to have high-end, steak house-themed cuisine with overflowing fine red wine.

The beauty of [planning a yacht party](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/yacht-party-planning-tips/) is that you have a blank slate to create the exact vibe that will best appeal to your guests. From the food to the beverages to the music and even video presentations, our staff will work with you and your hosts to create the ideal atmosphere.

And, of course, all of the ambiance is set against a million-dollar backdrop of the sparkling Pacific Ocean. Sunsets and swimming dolphins only add to the majesty of the event at no extra cost!

The goal should be creating a once-in-a-lifetime few hours where every guest upon disembarking feels as if they’ve just enjoyed a mini-vacation with memories that will last forever.

## **3 – How can I make sure my party will be memorable?**

Having a **yacht party on the water** presents you with endless possibilities for fun! A memorable party needs expert coordination; be sure you’re working with an experienced company like FantaSea Yachts with over four decades of [hosting yacht weddings](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/weddings/pricing-and-packages/) and providing a yacht rental in Marina del Rey. 

From views to amenities, our party planners have the knowledge and experience to help you envision your party from start to finish—and from inside to out.

Party planners will take care of all the details so you can sit back and relax rather than stress over last-minute logistics. A party planner makes your event unforgettable by helping you create an itinerary with music, entertainment, and catering while keeping in mind the unique experience you want to create.

And did we mention the Ocean? 

Your event is guaranteed to be memorable just by having the Pacific Ocean and the [Malibu coastline](https://www.californiabeaches.com/southern/los-angeles-county/malibu/) as your ultimate, priceless backdrop.

## **4 – When is the best time to hold a party?**

There are many factors to consider when determining whether to have a [day or night yacht party.](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/yacht-party-day-or-night/)

For example, if it’s your child’s birthday party then Saturday or Sunday early afternoon would be preferable to ensure that parents have no work commitments to attend. Alternatively, an evening cruise might be more appropriate for a black-tie event like a fundraiser or a formal wedding. 

Consider also your guest list. If it is an anniversary yacht party and the guests skew older, then perhaps a brunch or afternoon affair would be most appropriate. 

If the event is a graduation and the party-goers are most likely young adults, then a night cruise would likely be the party that will have their peers talking about for years after the ship has docked. 

If the party will include alcoholic beverage options, it might be wise to pre-arrange Ubers or Lyfts to converge in Marina del Rey at the noted docking time, so guests won’t have to worry about driving home.

Additionally, consider how long the yacht will be rented. On average, our rentals usually last about 4 hours. However, depending on your event needs or budget, we can adjust for more or less time on the water. 

Regardless, you choose the time that’s best for you and with the consistent beauty of the weather in Southern California – day or night or winter or summer – anytime is the right time for a memorable yacht celebration.

**5 – What other questions do you have for your yacht rental?**

The beauty of a party on a yacht is you enjoy the benefit of an event-planning crew who have been orchestrating the perfect Pacific parties for over 42 years. Like the insurance, the commercial says, “We know a thing or two because we’ve seen a thing or two” or three or more.

Our goal is for you to enjoy the event without the stress of learning every detail on your own. Let us help shape the event and take all the planning headaches off your plate.

You handle the invites, and we’ll do the rest!

With so many options to consider, it can be hard to narrow down your preferences. Contact Fantasea Yachts today and let one of our agents help you plan the perfect event – no matter how big or small!
