## TYPES OF YACHT PARTIES

When you party on a yacht, you party in style. Ocean breezes and sun-kissed moments will make any occasion special. Renting a yacht adds an element of exclusivity to your party.

Parties that happen on land are even better on a yacht. Do you host a yearly corporate event? Hosting your party on a yacht can revive annual events by adding a new surprising twist.

Over the years we’ve hosted a variety of parties and yacht weddings including:

  * [Anniversary party](/celebrations/anniversaries/)
  * Bachelor/Bachelorette party
  * [Birthday party](/celebrations/birthdays/)
  * [Prom party](/celebrations/prom-night/)
  * [Company party ](/corporate-events/)
  * [Retirement party](/celebrations/retirement-parties/)
  * [Graduation party](/celebrations/grad-night/)
  * [Quinceañeras](/celebrations/quinceaneras-and-debuts/)

## MAKE MARINA DEL REY YOUR PLAYGROUND

Located in [Marina del Rey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina_del_Rey,_California), FantaSea Yachts offers a premier yachting experience in one of the most beautiful places in the world.

The Marina del Rey area in Los Angeles is a haven for those who want to enjoy scenic beauty, wildlife, and world-class boating. The calm waters make yachting peaceful, as there are plenty of boats that can be seen from land or water! Not only do you get amazing views while out on our yachts but if you’re lucky you may spot one of the many types of wildlife that frequent Marina del Rey – such as California sea lions, harbor seals, migratory birds, and, during the right time of year, whales and dolphins. Night-time parties are special, too – moderate temperatures and evening views of the Los Angeles coastline are magical under the stars.
