## CELEBRATE YOUR BAR OR BAT MITZVAH WITH A PARTY ON ONE OF OUR THREE LUXURIOUS PRIVATE YACHTS

Near Los Angeles’ Westside in beautiful Marina del Rey, and a short drive from Orange County and surrounding areas, our three charter yachts are perfect for your special day, whether you’re inviting only a few special guests or up to 300 of your most cherished friends and family!

At FantaSea, we own and operate our three vessels, each offering something different and unique for your experience. Our yachts cruise inside the tranquil harbor of Marina del Rey amongst 8.5 miles of scenic waterway.

Unique, fun and first class! Is there any other way to get the party started? Whether you opt for an all young-adult party or a family-oriented Simcha, the folks at FantaSea are experienced in all aspects of creating the best Bar Mitzvah reception. Let us help make you shine like the star you have worked so hard to become.
