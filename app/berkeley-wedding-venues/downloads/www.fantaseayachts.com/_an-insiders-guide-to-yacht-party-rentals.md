[Yacht party rentals](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/celebrations/) are fun territory to charter. Whether you’re looking to plan an [epic corporate yacht party](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/plan-an-epic-corporate-yacht-party/), host a [birthday party on a yacht](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/plan-a-sensational-yacht-birthday-party-in-5-easy-steps/), rent a boat for a wedding, or [throw a retirement party on a yacht](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/retirement-party-idea-rent-a-yacht-for-a-party/), yachts are unique and exciting event venues. 

With more than 43 years in the yacht party business, our experienced team of event professionals is ready to walk you through the process every step of the way.

Party planning has never been so easy – especially with our insider tips and an expert team to help ensure yacht party success. 

## **Set your budget (and stick to it)**

Whether a grand soiree or an intimate celebration, your budget is at the core of your master plan. [Establishing a budget](https://in.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/how-to-create-event-budget) early on will help you decide what you want to prioritize – and that will help guide your decision-making. Need help planning? [Contact our team](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/contact/). 

Budgeting is not a sexy topic, but evaluating what matters most to you can be fun. Are you more focused on food? Music? Decor? An exclusive guest experience?

Budgeting helps you stay on track. For example, when tempted to splurge for a ten-piece band or a five-tiered cake, you can always reference your budget and see if that’s in the cards. If it falls outside your allocated costs, there’s your answer (and scapegoat!). 

## **Evaluate entertainment**

One of the best parts of hosting an event is delighting your guests. Thanks to Pinterest, Instagram, TikTok and a plethora of event publications, the possibilities to entertain your guests are endless.

– A DJ or band will keep your guests moving.   
– A magician or comedian will offer laughter.   
– Signature tastings create an exclusive experience  
– Games like cornhole and life-size Jenga keep the mood light and fun.   
– Photo booths with props act as social stations. 

Whatever you decide, consider the demographic of your guests and the vibe you want to evoke. You’ll want to be sure it hits all the right notes.   


## **Theme, decor, and rentals**

Consider whether you want a theme for your event. It’s not necessary but can be a fun attribute. And when it comes to [choosing a theme](https://www.npr.org/2022/10/26/1131622796/theme-holiday-party-planning-tips), there are so many to choose from!

If not opting for a theme, decide on the tone of your event. Formal? Casual? Cocktail? Your dress code will set the tone and help temper your guests’ expectations.  
  
Theme or no theme, you’ll need to decide on event decor (e.g., centerpieces, balloons, floral arrangements, color scheme) and determine what rentals you might need to fill your needs.   
  
Consider this a reminder that your yacht rental might not come equipped with furniture, linens, dinnerware, and other necessities. To make it easy, we have a list of trusted vendors and partners that we’ve worked with over the years for no-muss no-fuss logistical (and creative) planning.

## **Party Favors**

Show your guests how much you appreciate them with creative party favors! 

From yummy treats to personalized elements, the possibilities are endless – why not explore Pinterest for inspirational ideas and make sure all of your special touches reflect the colors, theme and atmosphere of your celebration.

Hosting a company party? Favors in the form of corporate swag are an opportunity to make a lasting impression with guests.

## **Menu**

It’s no secret that food plays a crucial role in any event and can greatly impact your guests’ overall experience. 

At FantaSea Yachts, we understand the importance of a well-crafted menu that caters to a variety of preferences and dietary restrictions.
