So, start here for valuable guidance on selecting the perfect elements for your event.

## **1 – Choose the right Marina de Rey yacht charter**

Planning a yacht party can be a lot of fun, but it’s important to choose [the right yacht rental for the event](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/yachts/fantasea-one/). 

### **A. Yacht Size**

The size of the yacht is one of the most important factors to consider. 

Yachts come in different sizes, accommodating various group sizes and preferences. Use these tips to make a decision about the type of yacht to rent. 

  * Consider the number of guests you plan to have onboard and ensure that the yacht has ample space to accommodate everyone comfortably.
  * If you have specific requirements for cabin configurations or private quarters, take those into account during your selection process

  * When deciding on a [party yacht rental](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/celebrations/), think about which amenities would be most important for your party. Planning on having a lot of dancing? You’ll want to make sure that there’s plenty of space on deck.



### **B. Crew and Services**

The crew plays a vital role in delivering an exceptional yacht charter experience.

  * Decide on the level of service you desire and ensure that the yacht you choose provides a professional and experienced crew. From skilled captains and attentive stewards to talented chefs, a well-trained and friendly crew can elevate your journey and cater to your every need.
  * Determine if the yacht company you choose has dedicated planners to guide you. An experienced planner who is familiar with luxury yacht events is key. Fortunately, at FantaSea Yachts, [dedicated **event planners** are here to help](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/contact/) every step of the way.



### **C. Check out Reviews and Recommendations**

Before finalizing your decision, take the time to read reviews and seek recommendations from previous charterers. Reviews can provide valuable insights into the quality of service, yacht condition, crew professionalism, and overall customer satisfaction. 

Look for testimonials that align with your expectations and consider them as part of your evaluation process.

FantaSea Yachts clients give us rave reviews. See our reviews on [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/biz/fantasea-yachts-marina-del-rey) and [Google Business Profile](https://goo.gl/maps/p8QmXcFktz9fCpBq7). 

Whether you’re hosting a big blowout on the [FantaSea One](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/yachts/fantasea-one/) or an intimate get-together on the [Admiral XL](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/yachts/admiral-xl/), we’ll help you select one of our **party yachts** that will be the right size and style to meet your unique needs.

## **2- Plan the menu – and let caterers do the rest**

A yacht party is a great opportunity to impress your guests with an amazing spread. Whether you’re serving breakfast, lunch, or dinner, there are a few things to keep in mind when planning your menu. 

First, think about the [time of day your party](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/yacht-party-day-or-night/) will be taking place. If it’s a brunch affair, you’ll want to serve lighter fare like charcuterie or a hardy salad; if it’s dinner, you’ll want to have more substantial options featuring multiple courses. 

Second, consider the type of party you’re throwing. An elegant yacht wedding might have a full sit-down dinner while a birthday celebration might have an informal menu served as a buffet.

Finally, don’t forget about dessert! A yacht party isn’t complete without something sweet to finish things off. Whether you opt for an elaborate cake or simple bowls of ice cream, your guests are sure to appreciate your attention to detail. By following these tips, you can easily plan a menu that will wow your yacht party guests.
