A [celebration of life party on a yacht](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/celebrations/scattering-of-ashes-celebration-of-life/) is a special, intimate service that families and friends hold to honor loved ones who have passed. 

At FantaSea Yachts, we help families plan beautiful celebrations during their time of grief. 

Whether it’s a lively jovial gathering or the [scattering of ashes,](https://cremationinstitute.com/scattering-ashes-at-sea/) we understand the importance of such an occasion and are committed to delivering exceptional service to our clients who entrust us to honor their loved one’s memory. .

**[Our yachts in Marina del Rey](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/celebrations/) are ideal venues to bring family and friends together. From open sky decks to exclusivity, here are five compelling reasons to have a celebration of life party on a yacht.**

## **Five Reasons to Have a C****elebration of Life Party on a Yacht**

### **The Ocean is Peaceful**

There’s no denying it. There’s something about the ocean. Especially during moments of grief.   
  
We’ve found that many of our guests find peace in being on the water. It’s one of the reasons the ocean is a fitting farewell tribute; the natural serene environment often evokes a sense of meaning and calmness. 

And because our cruises take you to the end of the Marina del Rey harbor (right to the edge of the open sea), guests find solace in the environment. 

The open decks of our yachts allow guests to move around, take in the wonder of the setting and just simply breathe and be with Mother Nature. 

### **Customizable Space**

Each of our yachts is an open floor plan that’s customized to meet the needs of your service. The elements that contribute to a meaningful farewell are entirely up to you. 

We’ve seen clients designate areas for [photos and various displays](https://www.joincake.com/blog/funeral-photo-display-ideas/) while others wanted to create a comfortable space for guests to sit and talk. 

Others have set up special entertainment or have found ways to incorporate the hobbies of their loved one throughout the space. 

With ample space for a band or DJ, music can be incorporated in the celebration.

Whatever you decide, the yacht is 100% yours and ready to be molded as needed. 

### **Exclusivity**

Perhaps the biggest value of FantaSea Yachts is that the charter of our yachts ensures the absolute privacy of your event. 

Though a joyous celebration, this is also a time for healing, and such a moment is often preferred to be private. 

Our exclusive [yacht charters Marina del Rey](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/3-steps-amazing-marina-del-rey-yacht-charter/) guarantee the privacy and dedicated space for your needs.

### **Dedicated Staff**

We’re committed to ensuring that your time is spent exactly how you want: Visiting with your loved ones.

We understand that your time together is cherished. Our highly experienced team handles the logistics and details so you don’t have to worry about a thing and can focus on the experience being shared. 

That’s what matters. 

Additionally, we offer full-service catering that can be tailored to your event. From favorite foods and signature dishes to religious accommodations and special diets, we can work with you to customize your menu

### **We’re a Family**

FantaSea Yachts is family-owned and operated and has been serving greater Los Angeles for more than 42 years. 

Much of our staff has been with us for 10, 15, and 20 years. Put simply, we care about your family because we ARE family. 

From the first consultation and planning to the day of execution, we are at your side to ensure thoughtful detail, listen to your needs, and empathize with you during this time of hardship.

We treat you like family because that is who we are. It’s our nature, our calling, our hallmark. 

And it’s our privilege to do so. Life is meant to be celebrated. Life is meant to be honored. Life is meant to be cherished. To learn more or to inquire about our services, [contact us](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/contact/).
