# Daniel Ginzburg

### ![](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/daniel-ginzburg-242x300.jpg) Owner

Daniel Ginzburg is the Co-Owner of FantaSea Yachts alongside his father, Uri Ginzburg, who founded their family business 38 years ago. Daniel is also the Chief Executive Officer and actively oversees all business management, development, and human resources. Daniel began working at FantaSea and learning the business at the age of fifteen. Learning how to run the company, he worked in every role available to learn the family business including boat cleaner, crew member, bartender, waiter, and event coordinator.

Daniel went on to attend Brandeis University in Massachusetts, earning a B.A. in political science. With an interest in law, Daniel returned to Los Angeles to attend Southwestern School of Law. After graduating, Daniel practiced law for three years. He returned to FantaSea in 1996 to take over and begin running the company, realizing it was more fun planning parties instead of lawsuits.

Daniel’s #1 goal is to meet the needs of FantaSea’s constantly changing and diverse clientele. His ability to do this, he attributes to his unique upbringing. Born to an Israeli father and an English mother, he spent part of his childhood living abroad in both England and Israel and was fortunate to visit many other countries while living overseas. This exposure gave him an appreciation and interest for different people and cultures at an early age.

Daniel’s choice to no longer practice law and head FantaSea Yachts has proven to be the best career move he could have made. In addition to working alongside his wife and creative director, Stephanie every day, he also finds great fulfillment in working with guests and leading the staff. Just like Daniel, most of his staff grew up working there. He has had the privilege of watching busboys become bartenders, interns become event planners, dishwashers become chefs and crew become captains. There are now three generations of families working together at FantaSea Yachts.

It is his passion, pride and dedication that drives Daniel to be successful and his personal experiences that he enjoys each day on the job that validates his hard work. He continues to be inspired to grow FantaSea Yachts and continue in the family tradition.
