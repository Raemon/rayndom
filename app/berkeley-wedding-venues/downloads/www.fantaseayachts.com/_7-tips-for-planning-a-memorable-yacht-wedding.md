Planning a [yacht wedding](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/weddings/) is an extraordinary journey, filled with anticipation and enchantment. And here at FantaSea Yachts, it’s our passion and purpose. 

Since 1980, we have been proudly serving the vibrant Los Angeles area, with our cherished home nestled in the breathtaking Marina del Rey. But what truly sets us apart is our deep-rooted love for yacht weddings and wedding planning.

It’s not just what we do; it’s what we absolutely adore doing. Our team of seasoned wedding planners is brimming with excitement to share their wealth of knowledge, insider tips, and clever tricks, all to help turn your dream into reality. 

Whether you’ve already chosen us as your venue or are considering making us a part of your special day, we are thrilled to present you with seven indispensable tips for orchestrating the perfect yacht wedding.

## **1\. Location, Location, Location!**

When planning a wedding, there are three words that never go out of style: location, location, location! 

If your dream venue consists of breathtaking ocean views, spectacular sunsets and a cool coastal breeze, then [Marina del Rey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina_del_Rey,_California) just might be the destination for you. What makes this dream location even more enticing is its convenient proximity, just four miles away from LAX, ensuring a hassle-free journey for your out-of-town guests who wish to be part of your joyous celebration.

But that’s not all. 

Marina del Rey is surrounded by two renowned beach cities that perfectly complement the Southern California experience – the world-famous Venice Beach and the sun-kissed Santa Monica. With these gems within minutes of your wedding venue, your guests can truly embrace the essence of Southern California and complete their must-see bucket list.

And don’t forget that with the right location comes remarkable views. Our guests are often wowed by fiery sunsets perched upon a shimmering ocean and viewed aboard [a yacht party rental](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/celebrations/). 

Not only will you enjoy unparalleled views of the picturesque Los Angeles coastline, but you might even be blessed with unexpected appearances from friendly dolphins, making your yacht wedding an even more enchanting experience.

If you’re seeking a location that seamlessly blends natural beauty, accessibility, and a touch of magic, Marina del Rey and FantaSea Yachts are here to make your dream yacht wedding come true.

## **2\. Set The Stage For Your Wedding Yacht Charter**

When it comes to planning a memorable yacht wedding, tip number 2 is all about setting the tone and embracing the power of details.

Grand or intimate? Traditional or themed? This decision will serve as the foundation for your entire celebration, guiding your choices for accents, decor, and creative touches that will make your special day truly unforgettable. 

Once you’ve set your course, the real fun begins—it’s time to dive into the intricacies.

This is your chance to infuse your wedding with personal touches that will delight your guests and create lasting memories. 

Whether it’s using an inside joke as the name of your signature cocktail, a customized dessert table or family heirlooms and photos at your celebration, the magic — as they say — is in the details. 

By investing effort into personalizing your wedding, you’ll leave a lasting impression and create an experience that reflects your unique love story.

## **3\. A Yacht Wedding Day Or Night?**

Leverage the unique experience of having your [wedding on a yacht](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/weddings/pricing-and-packages/).

From the breathtaking views and impeccable service to the mere fact that you’re on a yacht, every element contributes to an extraordinary experience. As you embark on this journey, one decision you’ll need to make is whether to have your celebration during the daytime or evening, each offering its own charm and ambiance.

Imagine an evening affair adorned with cocktail dresses and sharp suits, exuding elegance and sophistication. The night sky becomes your enchanting canopy as you revel in the beauty of twinkling stars and the harbor’s mesmerizing lights.  
  
On the other hand, if you envision a more relaxed and vibrant atmosphere, with a bright and airy vibe, a daytime wedding is the perfect choice. Picture your guests enjoying the Southern California sunshine as you exchange vows against the backdrop of the stunning coastline, stretching all the way to Malibu.

Whether you opt for the magical allure of sunset, the twinkling stars, or the sun-filled skies, rest assured that we have your back.

Our experienced team is here to assist you in creating the perfect ambiance, whether it’s through special lighting enhancements like gobos and sparklers or other delightful details that make your yacht wedding an unforgettable experience.

## **4\. Menu Delights**

When it comes to planning a memorable yacht wedding, tip number 4 revolves around the crucial task of choosing the perfect menu. It’s no secret that the culinary experience plays a significant role in shaping the overall enjoyment of your guests. However, at FantaSea Yachts, we believe in keeping things simple and stress-free.

There’s no need for off-site catering with our talented culinary team at the helm. Our chef (trained at the Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel) has served FantaSea Yachts for more than 20 years. From the moment your cocktail hour begins to the final bite of dessert, [Chef Eddie](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/about/our-staff/) and our dedicated staff are committed to providing an exceptional dining experience.

## **5\. Select Your Vendors**

Surround yourself with professionals. It’ll make things that much easier. Our team is an experienced group of event planning professionals with a deep and trusted vendor list ready to serve.

## **6\. Set Your Budget And Guest List  
**

The guest list and budget go hand in hand and play a crucial role in shaping your wedding experience.

  * ### Guest list




As you build your guest list, ask yourself if you want a big bash or intimate affair?

Determining the size of your guest list from the outset will not only help you envision the atmosphere you desire but also alleviate potential issues related to space and expenses. By having a clear headcount, you can ensure that you choose the perfect yacht rental that comfortably accommodates your guests while staying within your budget.

  * ### **Wedding budget**




Establishing a budget early-on will help identify your priorities. Is entertainment a top consideration? Or maybe you wish to create a magical ambiance through exquisite decor and stunning floral arrangements. 

By clearly earmarking your budget for each aspect, you can confidently navigate the wedding planning process and make informed decisions that align with your vision. Note that we provide custom [yacht wedding packages](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/weddings/pricing-and-packages/). 

## **7\. Choose Your Yacht**

Selecting the right venue will set the tone for your [luxury yacht wedding](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/luxury-yacht-weddings-the-ultimate-guide-to-your-dream-day/). At FantaSea Yachts, you have the luxury (and flexibility) of selecting a yacht based on your needs and vision. From spacious rooftop decks to elegant chandeliers, we’re confident our luxury yachts are an unforgettable wedding venue.

### FantaSea One

The largest of our fleet, [FantaSea One](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/yachts/fantasea-one/) is sure to WOW your guests. Its signature feature is an expansive rooftop which is often eyed for yacht weddings, corporate events and sunset sails or moonlit cruises. She can accommodate up to 250 guests so don’t be afraid to pack that dance floor! Other unique features include its modern Captain’s Lounge, formal (but customizable) seating area and beautiful marble bar that will quickly become a fixture of the evening.

### **Dandeana**

Our Flagship yacht, [Dandeana](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/yachts/dandeana/) is a popular choice for a reason: She’s a beaut. Clients love its sleek design and modern touches while guests marvel at its glass windows and sparkling views. Its deck (though smaller than FantaSea One), offers guests the opportunity to experience rooftop views of ocean sunsets and moonlit skies. 

Perhaps you’re looking for a beach wedding without the muss and fuss of sand. Dandeana is the perfect alternative to a beach wedding. She can accommodate up to 100 guests and is often recognized for appearances in popular movies and TV shows.
