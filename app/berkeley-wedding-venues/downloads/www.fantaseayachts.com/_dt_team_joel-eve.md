Joel Eve has been Senior Captain for FantaSea Yachts since August 1988 when he saw the Dandeana featured in a full-page ad. Captain Joel knew immediately that he was destined to be her captain. Twenty years later, Captain Joel is still her captain and also acts as FantaSea Yachts’ liaison to the U.S. Coast Guard; writing plans for specific safety and operational requirements, as well as, leading crew orientations and training.

Captain Joel was born and raised in the San Fernando Valley, but spent many of his formative years on the water learning boating and navigation from his father. At age twenty, while earning his BA in psychology from UCLA, he secured his first maritime job and never looked back. In 1976 he earned his Coast Guard Masters license and continues his education through courses at the Maritime Institute in San Diego.

Captain Joel’s career highlights include everything from managing Marina del Rey Hotel’s five charter vessels, to marrying Snoop Dog and his wife, to bringing Sir Anthony Hopkins to Catalina. What Captain Joel enjoys most about his job is getting to know his passengers personally and watching crewmembers become co-captains as a result of his coaching and teaching. Captain Joel is also dedicated to fundraising for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society in honor of his father and takes every opportunity to do so. He also enjoys biking and one of his proudest moments was completing the Solvang Century Bike ride fundraiser.

Captain Joel enjoys giving presentations at yacht clubs throughout Southern California and recently became a Contributing Editor to The Mariner, Marina del Rey’s local newspaper. In the future, he plans to combine his areas of expertise and develop his own show featuring the funniest moments in boating.
