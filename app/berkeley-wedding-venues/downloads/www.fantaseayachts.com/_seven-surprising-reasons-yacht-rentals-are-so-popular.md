To borrow from a famous phrase – some like it yacht. 

There are plenty of good reasons why [yacht rentals](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/yachts/) continue to be premier event venues. Some are drawn to the luxury of it all – that exclusive VIP feeling – while others marvel at the sheer beauty of their craftsmanship. Others soak in the ocean views and nautical charm. 

Apart from the luxury, grandeur, and beauty yachts offer, here are seven other reasons why people love to rent yachts for [special occasions](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/celebrations/).

## 1\. Unbelievable Value

This is always the biggest takeaway – and something we’re quite proud of. Many people assume that yacht rentals are out of reach, but that couldn’t be further from the truth.   
  
At Fantasea Yachts, we offer so much more than an event space. Our dedicated team helps you plan (and celebrate) life’s biggest moments. That includes unlimited counsel, creative brainstorming (for every idea or detail that pops in your head), and an experienced planner assigned to your special event at no extra cost (hello, savings).   
  
We also set up the day of your event AND takedown. You don’t lift a finger nor do you have to hire a special crew (more cost savings).   
  
We help you source vendors, coordinate day-of logistics, plan your menu, dream up your decor, and help anticipate your every need as part of our event planning services. 

Our goal is to make your dream event come true. You will have an exclusive event planner at your disposal to discuss every detail and nuance of your event. Whether you have a specific theme or need to uphold certain dietary restrictions, we have you covered.

  
And when it comes to your budget, it’s up to you to decide how simple or elaborate your celebration will be, keeping your finances in check and wallet happy. 

Affordability on a yacht? It’s not an oxymoron. It’s a very real option.   
  
Again… unbelievable value.

## 2\. Culinary Delights

From boat weddings in California to sunset cocktail cruises with your teammates, our yachts are meant for parties. And [no good party on a yacht is complete without a crowd-pleasing spread](https://www.theknot.com/content/reception-food-ideas-entree).

A common misconception for party yacht rentals is that an outside catering company must be hired. Not at FantaSea Yachts!

Our culinary team is at the helm, ready to delight your guests with delectable bites. From seasonal fare and customized menus to tasty appetizers and signature drinks, we are fully equipped to prep, cook, and serve up to 250 guests.

We love it when we surprise our guests and deliver on something unexpected. Food is often that unexpected highlight. We hear frequently from partygoers that our generous portions and delicious eats surpassed their expectations – and we are more than happy to hear it.

## 3\. Picture Perfect

Ocean views and luxury yachts go hand-in-hand. Many of our clients squeal with delight when they realize their [yacht wedding](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/weddings/) or party will likely be accompanied by a Southern California sunset spectacular and sweeping views of the Pacific Ocean.

Is there anything more romantic than taking your wedding pictures as the sun dips into the sea? We didn’t think so.

That’s what makes a [party yacht rental in Los Angeles](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/yacht-party-day-or-night/) the picture-postcard event that your group will remember for a lifetime. You will also become the envy of friends and family who couldn’t join, yet feel like they were part of something special when you share coveted images and videos of your magnificent day on Instagram and Facebook.

It’s so fun for us to see guests snap that perfect selfie or gather together for that group photo to make sure they are getting that million-dollar backdrop. Say cheese!

## 

## 4\. Guestlist Battles

It’s no secret that guest lists can cause so much wedding planning stress. With yacht parties, you know the maximum guest count right from the get-go. For example, our [Dandena Yacht](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/yachts/dandeana/) can hold up to 100 guests while our [FantaSea One Yacht](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/yachts/fantasea-one/) can hold up to 250. This means that you stay in control of those invites based on the available space (not personal preference).

Having a maximum count as the end game is a real game-changer. This means no excuses as to why so-and-so didn’t make the cut. It’s a matter of practicality and logic. And if you need a buffer when it comes to trimming your guest list, space is always a safe option.

## 

## 5\. The WOW Factor

We’ve been in the event planning business for 42+ years and one theme has remained constant since we opened our doors in 1980… hosts want to dazzle their guests. And that’s one of the biggest appeals to hosting your event on a yacht.

When you host an event on a yacht, you are giving your guests a luxurious experience that will be remembered long after the night is over. It’s not every day that people are on a yacht. Let alone, sip champagne on a yacht. Take pictures on a yacht. Catch the sunset from a yacht.

Yachts are fun and hip yet luxurious and totally VIP. And who doesn’t want their guests feeling like a million bucks? Roll out the red carpet!

## 6\. Motion Sickness – What’s That?

People often ask if people get motion sickness on our yachts. Our answer is no.

The great thing about our cruises is that we stay in the Marina del Rey harbor and don’t go past the breakwater. This eliminates any wave activity (there are NO waves), which makes for an easy, smooth ride. There is virtually no risk of seasickness or motion sickness cruising these calm waters. Another win!

## 7\. One Venue, One Place

Another [surprising perk to yacht rentals](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/weddings/pricing-and-packages/) is that once you board the yacht, your destination is set for the event’s duration. No awkward time gaps between a wedding ceremony and reception. No shuffling back and forth. No wasted time.

Once guests are greeted upon arrival, the fun begins, with no intermissions. Whether you’re [celebrating a wedding in Marina del Rey](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/five-reasons-why-a-yacht-wedding-in-marina-del-rey-is-best/), hosting an office party, or getting the fam bam together for a family reunion, your guests will love the fact that they don’t have to worry about getting to the next spot.

It’s time to unwind and enjoy the moment. After all, isn’t that what it’s all about?
