## BAR AND BAT MITZVAHS ON THE WATER

Celebrate your special day with friends and family on a luxurious yacht. Near Los Angeles’ Westside in beautiful Marina del Rey, and a short drive from Beverly Hills, The Valley and Orange County, our three largest private yachts are perfect Los Angeles Bar Mitzvah venues, whether you’re inviting only a few special guests or up to 250 of your most cherished friends and family. Let your imagination be the creative director!

### UNFORGETTABLE CELEBRATIONS

Marina del Rey offers no better bar mitzvah location than our two fabulous yachts: DANDEANA and FANTASEA ONE. As Members of the Tribe ourselves (and Family Owned and Operated since 1980), we will help you take care of all the planning; catering, bar, entertainment and decorations; and especially the location! Make this special day the one your friends and family will remember  _for the rest of their lives_ … with a little help from the dedicated team of professionals at FantaSea Yachts.

### KOSHER MEALS

We have worked side-by-side with most Kosher Caterers in Los Angeles and welcome the opportunity to have them back onboard. This is just one of the several detailed services that we offer to make our yachts an ideal bar mitzvah location.

### ALWAYS SMOOTH SAILING

The yachts we have for rent will travel through the tranquil harbor of Marina del Rey amongst 8.5 miles of scenic waterway where the views of the Los Angeles coastline and Santa Monica Bay are breathtaking. There is virtually no risk of seasickness or motion sickness cruising these calm waters.
