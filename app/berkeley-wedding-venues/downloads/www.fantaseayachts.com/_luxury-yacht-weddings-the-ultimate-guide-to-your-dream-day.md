If [luxury yacht weddings](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/weddings/) are on your mind, then you might have already started imagining the kind of celebration you want to have with your significant other. From elegant wedding dresses on boats to elaborate decorations, the possibilities are endless.

While some couples prefer to have the sea as their witness to their ceremony, others opt to have the ceremony elsewhere and hold the reception on the water. Planning is crucial when it comes to a yacht wedding. 

Wedding budgets, styles, guest counts and yacht capacity are some of the elements to consider when planning your boat wedding. 

Here’s what you need to consider when planning your important day.

## **Choose your luxury yacht**

At Fantasea Yachts, we offer top-of-the-line yacht rentals and unparalleled service to help you plan your perfect day. From the ceremony to the reception, we’ll work with you to create a magical experience that you and your guests will never forget.

Our [fleet of yachts](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/yachts/) offers a range of sizes and styles, so you can choose the perfect vessel for your celebration. Yacht capacity will determine the size of your wedding. 

Imagine saying your vows against the stunning backdrop of the ocean, surrounded by your loved ones and the gentle lull of the waves. Our yachts are equipped with everything you need to make the day special, from elegant dining areas to spacious lounges and fully stocked bars.

## **How much does it cost to have a boat wedding?**

A traditional event hall normally costs more to rent than a boat. When [renting a yacht for a wedding](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/weddings/pricing-and-packages/), all charges are included within the wedding package including the gratuity. 

So what does a typical yacht[ wedding in Marina del Rey](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/five-reasons-why-a-yacht-wedding-in-marina-del-rey-is-best/) cost? [Get an estimate](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/contact/) from one of our wedding event specialists. 

## **Onboard ceremony and reception**

Of course, everything will depend on your budget and taste, but once you commit to a yacht wedding, many decisions are easier to make.

## **How do you plan a private yacht wedding?**

The following practical advice for planning a wedding at sea is a must-read if you envision having your wedding on a yacht. Like all important events, you want to be sure you are covering all your bases and keeping your wits about you in the process.

There are numerous benefits to getting married on a yacht, including the ability to rent a yacht that offers accommodations for all guests and the convenience of having the ceremony and celebration in the same location. 

This following will help you organize your big day with the best tips and ideas.

## **Decide on a destination**

If you’re getting married in Marina del Rey on one of our yachts, then you’ve already arrived at your destination. Marina del Rey, California is a hidden gem for those seeking a picturesque and unique wedding destination. Located just a few miles from Los Angeles, Marina del Rey boasts stunning waterfront views and a relaxed, coastal atmosphere.

With year-round sunshine and endless opportunities for adventure, Marina del Rey is a dream destination for couples seeking a wedding experience that’s both unforgettable and effortlessly chic.

## **The decor**

When it comes to planning your yacht wedding, the aesthetics and ambiance are just as important as the logistics. The decor sets the tone for the entire event and creates a memorable experience for you and your guests. While a [nautical theme](https://www.theknot.com/content/nautical-wedding-ideas) may seem like an obvious choice for a yacht wedding, there are countless other themes that can be executed to perfection.

From a classic romantic setting with soft lighting and floral accents to a modern and minimalist design with sleek, sophisticated furnishings, the options are endless. You can choose a bohemian theme with a rustic, earthy feel or go for a glamorous, black-tie event with dramatic lighting and lavish decor. Whatever your preference, FantaSea Yachts can help you bring your vision to life.

## **Choosing menus for luxury yacht weddings**

When it comes to selecting catering for your yacht wedding, there are a few things to consider. 

If you’re looking to create a menu that’s in keeping with a marine theme, seafood can be a great addition to your offerings. Whether it’s fresh oysters, sushi rolls, or a seafood paella, there are countless ways to incorporate delicious, ocean-inspired dishes into your menu.

![Menu for a luxury yacht wedding](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Menu-for-a-luxury-yacht-wedding-300x220.png)

You can also explore local delicacies and specialties from the area where you’ll be celebrating your wedding, giving your guests a taste of the local culture and cuisine.

Another option is to work with a catering company that specializes in creating custom menus for yacht weddings. At FantaSea Yachts, our expert culinary team can help you design a menu that perfectly complements your theme and style. We offer a range of options, from hors d’oeuvres and canapes to multi-course dinners and dessert buffets, all crafted with the freshest, locally-sourced ingredients.

In addition to food, beverages are also an important aspect of any yacht wedding. From signature cocktails to fine wines and craft beers, there are plenty of options to choose from to complement your menu and enhance your guests’ experience. Whatever your preferences, we can help you create a catering plan that’s both delicious and memorable.

## **Providing entertainment for a luxury yacht wedding**

During weddings, entertainment is an essential component of the celebration. The good news is, there are a thousand ways to ensure fun: hire a talented DJ, live music, and dancers. Lastly, don’t forget to [utilize our wedding specialists](https://www.wedinspire.com/articles/guide/7-benefits-of-hiring-a-wedding-planner/) who will help you plan a successful wedding without stress.
