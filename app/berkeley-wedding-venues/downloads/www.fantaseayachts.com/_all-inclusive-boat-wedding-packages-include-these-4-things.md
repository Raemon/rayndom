There are many [reasons to get married on a yacht.](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/seven-surprising-reasons-yacht-rentals-are-so-popular/) Ocean views. Unique event space. Pristine glamor and the VIP experience that comes with it. And at FantaSea Yachts, a [wedding aboard our luxury yacht fleet ](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/weddings/)offers all that and more.  


As you’re searching for yacht wedding venues along the California coast, consider the different [all-inclusive boat wedding packages](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/weddings/) that are offered with each venue. 

Since we launched our first yacht in Marina del Rey 42 years ago, we’ve taken great pride in knowing that our yacht weddings offer terrific value – thanks to our customized wedding packages

## **Look for These Top Selling Points in an All Inclusive Boat Wedding Package**

## **1\. Unlimited expertise**  


At FantaSea Yachts, we mean it when we say that we are by your side every step of the way. We understand that weddings require planning and that creative brainstorming is part of the territory. If you’re looking for someone to bounce ideas off from, we’re here to listen.

Want to play around with table arrangements? We’ll mock up a few tables for you. We believe that the right table arrangements can transform your wedding reception into a breathtaking spectacle. Whether you envision an intimate gathering or a grand celebration, we’re here to bring your ideas to life.

Can’t decide on a linen color? We get it. Choosing the perfect linen color can be challenging. We’ll order a few samples for you to review. Touch and compare colors, so you can make an informed choice.

Need help choosing a [wedding theme](https://www.weddingforward.com/wedding-themes/)? We’ll talk you through different ideas and share what worked (and what didn’t) based on our experience. (spoiler alert: we’ve seen and done just about every theme imaginable, from the roaring 20s to winter wonderland, so we have lots to share!)

![boat wedding package](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/yacht-wedding-theme-300x200.jpg)

Our advice comes from experience. And we provide unlimited counsel to help ensure a smooth sailing, stress-free, and, dare we say, FUN wedding planning experience. It’s the FantaSea way.   


## **2\. Set-up/take down service**  


One of the recurring compliments we receive from our clients is that they don’t have to lift a finger – and we mean that literally.

The last thing a bride or groom should worry about on their wedding day is setting up tables and chairs or packing up their gifts at the end of the reception.

That’s where we step in! We shine in day-of coordination. Event set-up and takedown, vendor coordination, time checks, and any last-minute needs that arise.

### **Detail focus**

Our event professionals start the day early to set up your celebration just as you planned. We take care of every last detail – down to the napkin rings – so you don’t have to worry.

Escort cards, favors, custom drink menus…check, check, check! 

Centerpieces, seating chart, welcome sign…no problem!

Floral arrangements, photo booth, guest book…consider it handled!

### **Time** **checks** : 

We keep a close eye on the schedule making sure everything runs on time. From the ceremony through to the reception, we’ve got it covered. 

### **Last** **minute needs**

Unexpected issues can come up but, rest assured, we’re prepared to handle them swiftly and discreetly. Your confidence in us is our top priority.

At the end of the night, we take down the venue, pack up your gifts, and decorations and load them into your car (bubble wrap, included!). And since we’re pros, we do it all at lightning speed (and before you even realize it’s happening!). 

How’s that for VIP service (and peace of mind)!

## **3\. Trusted vendors of yacht rentals for weddings**  


It’s no secret that every good wedding planning business has a strong vendor list. So it shouldn’t be a surprise that we’ve procured partnerships with some of the best wedding vendors in Los Angeles.   


Need help with a DJ, band, or florist? We can recommend proven crowd-pleasers.   


Considering wedding photography? We can refer you to a list of photographers who know our yachts, the sunlight, and the Marina like the back of their hands (it’s that kind of inside knowledge that makes for amazing photos)

![Boat wedding cost](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/yacht-wedding-FantaSea-Yachts-300x200.jpg)

If you have your own dream team in mind, no problem! We’re happy to coordinate logistics on your behalf. 

  
Our clients rest assured knowing that our vendors are vetted, trusted, and five-star approved.   
  
The bottom line is don’t get caught up in the swirl of [vendor management](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/vendor-booking-timeline). We can help ease you through the planning of [getting married on a yacht](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/how-do-i-plan-a-small-yacht-wedding/). It’s what we’re here for. And what we LOVE to do.

## **4\. Dedicated event team**  


There’s no question that you’ll want an experienced team of event professionals at your side to help with logistics, coordination, creative ideas, and other special touches.  
  
At FantaSea Yachts, we’re proud to have [served the Los Angeles area since 1980](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/about/) and have a dedicated team of wedding extraordinaires who have seen and heard it all (translation: we’re ready for any request and are here to make your dreams come true).  
  
Our team of professionals thrives on delivering exceptional service from start to finish, from concept to execution, all in the name of love.  
  
By the end of the event planning process, our team will know which family member has the food allergies, the inside joke behind your signature cocktail, and what song the DJ shouldn’t play. 

  
And at your reception, our team is in sync and ready to rock. We manage the timeline, event flow, and hit all the milestones to keep your wedding seamless and on track.

We’ve also been known to bustle a wedding dress (or two or thousands) in our wedding planning lifetime. So, brides, don’t fret. We’ve got you.

It’s that type of dedication that stands the test of time and serves as one of our signature hallmarks. And is a service in which we take great pride.

## **5\. BONUS! Wedding officiant included**  


Get married by the boat captain! At **FantaSea Yachts** , many of our boat captains are registered wedding officiants – a perk that many of our couples use.  
  
That’s one less item on your to-do list. One less budget constraint. One more check for peace of mind.   
  
It’s such a unique feature – why not embrace the nautical charm?
