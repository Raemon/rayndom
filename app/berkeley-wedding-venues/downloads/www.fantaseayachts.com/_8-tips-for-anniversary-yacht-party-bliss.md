Anniversaries are special – and certainly worth celebrating! At FantaSea Yachts, we’ve been honored to plan some incredible anniversary [yacht parties](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/celebrations/) aboard our luxury fleet.   


From golden anniversaries to silver celebrations, our yachts are perfectly outfitted to host up to 250 of your closest family, friends, and loved ones as you toast to your sweetheart.   


And with our ideal Southern California location, there is no better place to plan your [Marina del Rey yacht charter](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/seven-surprising-reasons-yacht-rentals-are-so-popular/). Think glowing sunsets, ocean views, and a cool coastal breeze for the ultimate cruising experience. 

Ready to plan your [anniversary yacht party](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/celebrations/anniversaries/)? Here are eight tips that will have your guests buzzing for years. 

### 1\. Renew Your Vows

The vows are the most sacred part of your wedding ceremony. Whether you write your own or recite tradition, your vows symbolize the love and commitment of your union. 

Consider a vow renewal ceremony during your anniversary yacht party. It doesn’t have to be long; an easy twenty minutes should be ample to reaffirm your commitment to one another.

![yacht party for anniversaries](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/marina-del-yacht-party-300x220.png)

It will likely be a special and intimate moment that your guests will feel honored to have witnessed. Kind of like having a [wedding on a yacht](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/weddings/) all over again.

### 2\. Recreate the First Dance

There’s nothing like the magic of a couple’s first dance. So why not recreate that moment at your anniversary party?

![anniversary party celebration on a yacht](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/FSY-yacht-party-for-an-anniversary-300x220.png)

Step onto the dance floor with your honey, gaze into each other’s eyes and [move to the song](https://www.theknot.com/content/classic-first-dance-songs) you first danced to as a newly married couple. 

We can almost guarantee there won’t be a dry eye in the house…err yacht!

### 3\. Display Original Wedding Pictures

Relive the moment by featuring some photos from your wedding day. Think wedding party, family formals, reception favorites, and portraits of the (then) newlyweds.   
  
Pictures can be [beautifully printed](https://www.womangettingmarried.com/unique-way-print-wedding-photos-online/) and displayed throughout the yacht or in a dedicated area of your choice.

![FSY anniversary photos](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/FSY-anniversary-photos-300x220.png)

Additionally, take a meme-like approach by showing a few before and after pictures. Contrast that newly minted couple shot with the family photo of the two of you, kids, dog, and the goldfish.   
  
Bonus points if you share a picture that no one has seen!

### 4\. Have a Champagne Toast

Nothing says celebration like a champagne toast. So, let’s pop the bubbly!  
  
A toast is a perfect time to express heartfelt sentiment to your partner. It’s also a great opportunity to thank your guests for celebrating with you.

![champagne toast on yacht](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/champagne-toast-on-a-yacht-300x220.png)

And don’t be surprised if your loved ones grab the mic to share some kind words about you. After all, they’re there to celebrate your love and commitment!

  
Thinking about toasting? Here are a [few tips to help make it a smash hit.](https://www.fastcompany.com/3063094/5-tips-for-giving-the-perfect-toast-no-matter-the-occasion)

### 5\. Break Out the Dance Floor

Do your guests like to swarm the dance floor? Book a DJ that will get your crowd moving. Or do you like to move to live beats? Live entertainment can seamlessly take your event from dinner to dancing, from large big bands to smaller trios. 

Whatever you decide, music matters. You can even crowdsource the playlist by asking your guests what songs they want to groove to!

![yacht party dancing](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/yacht-party-dancing-300x220.png)

### 6\. Incorporate Details from Your Wedding

Find ways to recreate that wedding magic by incorporating details from your wedding. 

For example, if you still have your wedding veil, can it be weaved in with your bouquet? Or perhaps your wedding party can throw back to the colors of their dresses and cumberbund somewhere in their attire. Or ask the DJ to play the song of your garter or bouquet toss.

![wedding party on a yacht](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/wedding-photos-from-a-yacht-300x220.png)

It’s those fun little touches that will have your guests smiling and make them feel like they’re actually attending a [glorious yacht wedding](https://www.fantaseayachts.com/weddings/pricing-and-packages/).
