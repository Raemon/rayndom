# Aldea Weddings Phoenix, Arizona

“Aldea is a unique and stunning indoor/outdoor wedding &amp; reception center. Our year-round facility offers stained glass windows, towering ceilings, arches, and beautiful courtyards for up to 300 guests. Aldea offers everything a dream wedding location should, from our location within the walls of Tlaquepaque (pronounced Tla-keh-pah-keh) in Phoenix.  
  
Tlaquepaque is a word from the Nahuatl Native Indian language – the ancient language of the Aztecs, meaning “the best of everything”. Built by Bob McIntyre and modeled after Sedona’s favorite village, just walking around the village is an adventure in discovery. Your senses will be delighted by the splashing sounds from the courtyard fountains. Its vine-covered stucco walls, brick walkways and magnificent arched entryways give you the feeling that Tlaquepaque has been here for centuries.  
  
“Aldea”, meaning “village” in the same native language, was incorporated to reaffirm the unique opportunity we have to create special events in the only true old world village atmosphere in the greater Phoenix area. Aldea Weddings has been hosting weddings at Tlaquepaque for over 8 years, and On Occasions has been in the wedding industry for over 11. We are a family owned business that strives to create the most memorable weddings as our brides and grooms dream them to be.”
