# The Charles Fort Wayne Fort Wayne, Indiana

It is not as hard as you imagine to have fun and have a stress-free event. They are not mutually exclusive with the experienced professionals at The Charles Fort Wayne. We take the stress of event-planning off your shoulders so you can truly live in the moment.  
  
Surround yourselves with the best and your event will be the best!   
  
In 2016, The Charles Fort Wayne (at the former location of The Shiloh) made it the easiest thing in the world to find a venue that does the planning for you when Marry Me In Fort Wayne, the award-winning Event Planners, purchased the venue. Immediately, the experienced staff of both The Charles and Marry Me In Fort Wayne began hosting dazzling affairs in the North West area of Fort Wayne.  
  
Gather from 25 to 700 of your nearest and dearest to celebrate in a brand-new Charles Event Center with more than 45 years of history behind it. Your best events await!
