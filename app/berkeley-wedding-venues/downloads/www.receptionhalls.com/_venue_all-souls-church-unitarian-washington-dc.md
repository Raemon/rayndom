# All Souls Church, Unitarian Washington, DC

All Souls Church, built in the 1920s, is a faithful copy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields of London. Our historic house of worship features a bell cast in 1822 by Paul Revere's son and a Sanctuary that seats up to 700 guests amidst Corinthian columns and the resonant strains of the famous Reiger Organ. Described as a "wedding cake of a church," it offers a spectacular setting for celebrating your union.  
  
Couples of all religious backgrounds and orientations are warmly welcomed at All Souls Church, where the first publicized service of same-sex union in history was held.  
  
We understand that this is a special day for you, one of the most important in your life, and we're committed to ensuring that your ceremony is as meaningful and smoothly realized as it is beautiful.
