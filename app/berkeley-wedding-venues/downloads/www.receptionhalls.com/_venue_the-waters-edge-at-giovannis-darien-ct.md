# The Waters Edge at Giovanni's Darien, Connecticut

Whether a wedding of 350, a kosher bar/bat mitzvah of 200, or a rehearsal dinner of 20, your magical day will be planned and executed by our seasoned team with the care and professionalism that only JoAnn and Sal Latorraca—and of course, Giovanni himself—can provide. In fact, our entire family is dedicated to making every dream come true—focusing on one wedding or bar/bat mitzvah at a time...yours, and even accommodating onsite ceremonies.
