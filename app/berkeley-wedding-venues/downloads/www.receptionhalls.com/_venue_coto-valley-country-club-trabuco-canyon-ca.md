# Coto Valley Country Club Trabuco Canyon, California

Coto Valley Country Club is the original club in Coto de Caza, in south Orange County. John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, Kenny Rogers to name but a few of old Hollywood who used to visit - come and look at the original bar with the name plates of some of our more famous guests.  
Imagine your ceremony on the lush, green lawns at the romantic gazebo or under your favorite tree or even on the front patio near the gorgeous fountain and pond. So many possibilities! Then after cocktail hour come inside to the elegantly rustic ballroom with crystal chandeliers and barn doors. At night, you can view through the large windows the patio lights and tree lights.   
We can seat up to 300 in our main ballroom with space for the dance floor or buffet in our Canyon Room.  
Coto Valley Country Club is one of the few venues in Orange County to offer outside catering and bar. You bring in a caterer of your choice and all of your own alcohol with no corkage fee. You can also have a live band or DJ of your own choice. We do, of course, have many recommendations for you for any vendor you may need.   
We supply all of the tables and chairs - our Chivari chairs are standard with the rental. We have 60” rounds, 48” rounds and 6ft buffet tables as well as cocktail tables. We have a large prep station as well as fridge, freezer and ice maker for your use. We also allow candlelight and you are welcome to either bring in your own decorations or use some of ours that previous brides have kindly left for your use.   
We have a beautiful bridal suite as well as a grooms room along with ping pong tables and fusball tables to help calm those nerves!  
We have so many photo opportunities around the grounds. Many mature trees and flowers as well as a 1950 GMC truck!
