# Catskill Weddings at The Natural Gardens East Meredith, New York

A kind of eden tucked into the Northeast, Catskill Weddings at Natural Gardens provides couples with a natural getaway that is ideal for a whimsical wilderness wedding. Everything about this location gently whispers peace and serenity. Envision walking through a lush green field as your wedding aisle and saying your vows at the glittering pond-side beneath an archway of tree branches, with the ambient music of tweeting birds and fish leaping from the water creating the soundtrack for one of the most important moments of your life. A nearby stone waterfall and flourishing flowers adds character to this already uniquely beautiful outdoor space!   
  
The quaint wooden gazebo, beautifully cultivated land, dense woods, and glittering pond waters all serve as the perfect backdrops for singular wedding photos. Host a rustic reception in the nearby pavilion, a bare bones venue that begs for your personal touches. The cedar floors, vaulted ceilings, and exposed beams define the space, offering the perfect vibe to match your laid back ceremony. Enjoy one-of-a-kind views of the ponds and surrounding forest out of the structure’s wide windows, allowing your guests to breathe in the fresh air of the scenic Catskills while celebrating your union! Ultimately, Catskill Weddings at Natural Gardens is the perfect match for the couple that wants to enjoy a wilderness retreat for their big day!
