# The Ameswell Hotel Mountain View, California

Born in Silicon Valley  
We are all about location – walking distance from downtown Mountain View, moments from Google, Apple and Facebook headquarters, as well as offices for Microsoft, Intuit and LinkedIn, close to Shoreline Amphitheatre, Levi’s Stadium, Stanford University and Stanford Shopping Center, and the nearby beach towns of Santa Cruz and Half Moon Bay.  
  
The Ameswell Hotel is the perfect business and social hub in Silicon Valley.
