# Headwaters Arts and Conference Center Dubois, Wyoming

The Headwaters Arts and Conference Center  
is a year-round conference facility for weddings and receptions,  
national conferences, educational meetings, art and music workshops,  
and corporate retreats. We are proud to host the Susan K. Black  
Foundation (SKB) annual rendezvous and workshop every September!  
Headwaters is also the home to the Wind River Valley Arts Guild and  
the Dubois Visitors Center. Come see the Warm Springs Art Gallery,  
spend some quiet time in the Joe and Mary Back library (and the soon  
to be opened Joe and Mary Back museum) or just get tons of local  
information about the area.  
  
Our grand, rustic, building crafted from timber and stone opened in 1996. It is  
the heart of Dubois, Wyoming! Dubois is nestled in the Wind River  
Valley between the dramatic beauty of the Wind River Mountains and the  
volcanic Absarokas Mountains. The Wind River runs right through town and right  
next to our Headwaters Arts and Conference Center building. In Dubois,  
you will discover a place where the West still lives.  
  
Our venue offers space for both business and private  
functions. Outdoor weddings are beautiful next to the Wind River and  
with our affordable all-in-one packages, we take some of the stress  
out of planning your special day! Our indoor spaces are where many  
businesses, clubs, and organizations choose  
to hold their training and retreats.  
  
The Headwaters Arts and Conference Center can  
accommodate large and small groups, with a list of amenities designed  
to make your next event easy to plan and very memorable. We are proud  
of the state-of-the-art acoustics in our Wind River room and the  
audio-visual equipment complements the amazing clarity of sound. Our  
commercial kitchen is fully equipped with everything you need, from  
spoons to professional refrigerators, to cater your event.  
  
Our staff is waiting to make your experience as easy  
and enjoyable as we can. We look forward to meeting you soon!
