# The Seawell Ballroom Denver, Colorado

Located in the heart of downtown’s Theatre District, the Denver Center for the Performing Arts features two full-service rental venues that host some of the city’s most spectacular events. As part of the region’s leading theatre organization, the Seawell Ballroom and Directors Room have been setting the stage for inspired events since 1998.   
  
As a turn-key venue, the DCPA’s Event Services team helps with every step of the planning process, from theatrically inspired design to Broadway-caliber lighting and concert-quality sound. And our eight catering partners provide food and beverage options sure to “wow” a crowd.   
  
The Seawell Ballroom is a 10,000-square-foot venue complete with HD broadcast capabilities, LED crystal ceiling lighting, and a full team to manage each event. Transform the space into an intimate cocktail party or host a black-tie gala. No vision is too extravagant. Groups of 200-1,000. Rates start at $6,000.
