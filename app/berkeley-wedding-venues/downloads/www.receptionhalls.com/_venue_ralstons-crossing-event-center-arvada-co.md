# Ralston's Crossing Event Center Arvada, Colorado

Happily Ever Afters begin at Ralston's Crossing Event Center!   
  
This one-of-a-kind setting includes a 1910 brick chapel accented by a 40x80 covered pavilion and gardens throughout its 1.5-acre grounds. It is a unique combination of historic and modern. It boasts ample room for family and friends, while retaining an intimate feel. Ralston’s Crossing features both indoor and outdoor facilities for any wedding, all in the shadows of the Rocky Mountains.  
  
Ralston’s Crossing allows a bride to create her dream wedding, with our entire facility at her disposal. She can decide whether the ceremony will be located within the chapel or out in the gardens, under the vine covered trellis, on the brick patio or the pavilion, or any combination. She can create a Cinderella feeling by using a horse and carriage, which is the perfect accent for this property. She can truly create a lifetime memory with us.
