# Ely Manor Event Center Linn, Missouri

Originally built as the Osage County Poor Farm in 1893, this nationally registered historic home, is a premier events estate, featuring both an elegant manor and manicured landscape. Whether you are looking to establish your own historic memories at an indoor or outdoor venue, we know you will love Ely Manor. The three-story manor features old-world craftsmanship throughout—high ceilings, wood floors, crown molding, and ask about interesting historic events taking place on the property. The spacious first level showcases a luxurious formal dining room, sun room, guest quarters and much more.
