# Heavenly Doves By JERRY GARCIA Oxnard, California

~ A White Dove Release is Joyous, Inspiring, and Uplifting ~  
  
Our white dove release will turn your dream wedding, into reality. Your wedding should be as beautiful, inspirational and meaningful, as the depth of love and devotion between each of you.   
  
A tradition that was once considered worthy only of royalty; as of Kings and Queens, our expert white dove handlers will assist you with any number of meaningful and memorable releases. Traditional or custom, we will assure that all displayed will be tastefully decorated to coordinate with   
  
Our White Doves will draw all eyes to the clear blue sky, with the fluttering grace of their wings, carrying hope and promise toward the heavens.   
  
The two white doves flying off together is another reminder of the new couple beginning their new life together.
