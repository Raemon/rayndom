# The Valley Oak Room Lincoln, Nebraska

The Valley Oak Room is a romantic countryside wedding ceremony and reception venue nestled in valleys of the rolling Nebraska countryside, with a beautiful 18-hole golf course surrounding the venue. The ballroom has seating at rounds for 140, dance floor, and a warm fireplace that creates a romantic ambiance for the evening. The Valley Oak Room includes an outdoor covered balcony overlooking the beautiful golf course which is great for a cocktail hour, alternate ceremony location or additional seating to accommodate a larger wedding.
