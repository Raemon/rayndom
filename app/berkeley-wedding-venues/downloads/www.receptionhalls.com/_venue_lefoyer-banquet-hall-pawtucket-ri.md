# LeFoyer Banquet Hall Pawtucket, Rhode Island

For generations, the LeFoyer Club has been providing a unique setting for countless special events. Our prized achievement of our recent makeover is our brand new Special Events Menu, a well thought out, locally sourced work of art, that a team of our most experienced executive chefs created. On it you will find classic entrees such as our Grilled New York Strip and beautifully prepared Cedar Plank Alaskan King Crab Legs along with some new ethnic dishes including a braised Cilantro Chicken Thigh.  
  
We invite you to come in, experience for yourself the amenities, the friendly staff, and the modern classic feel of this historic venue.
