# Jackson Street Cottages Charleston, South Carolina

This historic grouping of four Charleston Freedman’s Cottages share one large gated parcel of land. This closed campus configuration encircles the central courtyard creating a private open air space perfectly suited to host all manner of events.  
  
The two main event buildings are centered on the property and feature brick fireplaces, high ceilings, gorgeous hardwood floors, service areas, facilities, expanded side and rear porches, and a full bar. Outside, a charming oasis that feels far from the hustle and bustle of downtown life awaits, replete with fairy lights, greenery, cabana lounge areas and the capacity for live music – it is truly the perfect venue for outdoor gatherings ranging from receptions, rehearsal dinners and brunches to corporate events and pop-ups.  
  
Our intimate and historic venue is a unique and beautiful backdrop for any event, one that showcases its historical roots in a romantic setting. We are looking forward to scheduling time to show you around our gorgeous and one of a kind space today.
