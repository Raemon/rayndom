# Northwest Arena - Jamestown Mattress Arena Club Jamestown, New York

The Jamestown Mattress Arena Club underwent a complete renovation in 2020. This Jamestown, New York venue is fresh and modern, with an inviting urban atmosphere and stunning city backdrop. Neutral, clean finishes and décor in addition to a unique two-tier open floor plan give this space an appealing industrial aesthetic while maintaining warmth and intimacy. It is suitable for nearly every event, from intimate to extravagant, corporate meetings to dream weddings, and more.  
  
Floor-to-ceiling windows comprise the entire eastern wall, creating great natural light and offering guests an impressive view of Downtown Jamestown. Interior windows overlook the Northwest Arena's primary ice rink. Shades cover both sets of windows to control the ambient light and atmosphere. Sliding panels and screens on the ice-facing windows allow sound from the rink to enter the Jamestown Mattress Arena Club when in the open position.
