# Bridgewood Events Galt, California

About Bridgewood Events  
A tranquil setting, nestled upon seventeen secluded acres of beautiful open farmland. Bridgewood Events is bordered by scenic vineyards and lovely almond orchards. The focal point of the venue is a breathtaking pond surrounded by mature trees and plush green lawns, highlighted by a picturesque arched wooden bridge. Offering a rustic 4380 square foot pavilion style barn that proudly boasts an americana painting of the American flag waving gently on a breeze. The barn displays open beams with dimmable bistro lighting. Your guests will also adore the scenic views of the waterfront ceremony area. This intimate setting is perfect for an elegant country wedding, reception, family reunion or celebration of life. Even though we are conveniently found just a couple of miles off Highway 99 and ten minutes from I-5, at Bridgewood you’ll feel like you’re many miles away- situated on a quiet, dead end country road. Our mission is to provide you with a stunning backdrop for your event that will wow your friends and family and create amazing memories that will last a lifetime.
