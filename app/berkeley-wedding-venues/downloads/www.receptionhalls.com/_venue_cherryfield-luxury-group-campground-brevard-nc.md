# Cherryfield Luxury Group Campground Brevard, North Carolina

Cherryfield Luxury Group Campground is a very unique wedding and event venue. The Campground offers the perfect collision of adventure and luxury. Our four tent pavilions (Hellbender, Ridgeline, Blue Ghost and Wild Turkey) are the perfect way to camp comfortably; built in the woods on 250 private acres right along Cherryfield Creek, you are surrounded by the sounds and sights of nature...on a sturdy, well-built campsite platform with a roof overhead (that’s right, not even rain can ruin your getaway!).  
  
Each of our four tent platforms comfortably fit four full size tents, our Airstream & GMC camper can sleep 10 people total (for those who might not be as wild about sleeping in tents!), and the property itself can comfortably accommodate 100 guests.  
  
All four of our spacious tent pavilions are side-by-side, making for easy gathering with parking right out front (making for easy loading and unloading). But that’s not all you have access to -- far from it! A quick walk across the road will lead you to your own personal luxury bathroom suites; one for folks staying at Blue Ghost and Wild Turkey and another separate, private bathroom suite for folks staying at Hellbender and Ridgeline. Each bathroom suite includes: two full bathrooms , two half baths, a luxury indoor steam shower (all with coded entry for your privacy) and two outdoor showers. Just outside of each bathroom suite are more amenities for your group to enjoy: covered meeting areas, large outdoor sinks, a large communal grill, our signature swings, multiple power outlets, bear proof food boxes, two fire pits, two Keurig coffee makers, and assorted coffees. We’ve also got plenty of beautiful wooden chairs and picnic tables dotted around this communal area to make your outdoor hangouts even cozier.  
  
See? We really meant it when we said that Cherryfield Campgrounds is where the Great Outdoors meets luxury.
