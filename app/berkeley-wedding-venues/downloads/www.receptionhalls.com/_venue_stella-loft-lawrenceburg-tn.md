Stella Loft is a unique historical building that was constructed in the 1930's just 30 minutes outside of Columbia, TN. In the quaint town of Lawrenceburg you'll find yourself conveniently located in the charming town square filled with local businesses, restaurants and the lovely town gazebo.  
  
The building was originally occupied by Massey Motor Company. Through the 1940's it was owned by Pioneer Motor Company selling Plymouth and Dodge autos and offering sales and service. Many locals today, remember this building as the original Parkes-Belk Clothing store who occupied this location for many many years.  
  
Inside our charming property you will find the original brick facade, extraordinary steel bow trusses and 4 magnificent chandeliers. The grand foyer has old Hollywood vibes with a subtle warehouse feel throughout.  
  
Your caterer will also have plenty of room to prepare in the venue's catering prep area featuring a double refrigerator, sink, freezer and prep tables. Stella Loft can accommodate up to 200 guests. Our venue provides 175 white padded chairs which can be used for ceremony or reception, 18 round tables and 4 rectangular tables. Most importantly the venue is climate controlled year around for your comfort.  
  
We would love to show you our extraordinary and charming place. There's really no other venue alike. We schedule tours by appointment only. We're looking forward to your call or email. Come visit Stella Loft, one of Nashville's most unique pieces of history.
