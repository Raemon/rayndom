The Riviera is the only completely private Wedding Facility featuring only One Wedding at a time...  
  
The Riviera takes pride in not only being a commercial wedding factory. We feel your wedding day, the most special day of your life, should be your day exclusively. At the Riviera, you will not have to share the facility, gardens, staff, and and valets with any other bride and groom or their guest.  
  
Mr. Zack Jr. sees to every detail of your wedding, and personally conducts your entire wedding reception from beginning to end. On your wedding day, the Riviera is not open to the general public. The staff at the Riviera is personally trained by Zack Jr., and they devote their entire energy to pleasing your family and guest exclusively.  
  
At the Riviera, we pride ourselves in being completely private because we want your guest to celebrate and remember you on your wedding day, not another bride and grooms on theirs...
