# National Park Seminary Ballroom Silver Spring, Maryland

The National Park Seminary Ballroom has been given new life. Restored historic character meets modern finishes in this grand venue. Built in the 1920s, this breathtaking space features high vaulted ceilings with heavy oak beams in true English Gothic style, with the curved bays exhibiting French influence. The original Auditorium Victrola and decorative busts were restored and can still be found in the ballroom today. The Ballroom is a uniquely beautiful interior space that is available for rental for both public and private events.  
  
Interested in renting this space? The Ballroom is perfect for wedding ceremonies, company events, services, recitals, concerts, graduations, and more!
