# ASC Greenway Venues Fort Mill, South Carolina

The Dairy Barn: The two story venue located just minutes from Charlotte, NC is perfect for events of all sizes and designs. We've recently upgraded the Dairy Barn outdoor event space by enlarging the back patio and completely re-landscaping the front of the barn making it possible to host both indoor and outdoor events of all sizes. The Dairy Barn also offers two spaces for both parties to relax and get ready for their special occasion. This venue is perfect for weddings, corporate events, birthday parties and all special occasions!  
  
The Field Trial Barn: This rustic red barn located on our gorgeous greenway is perfect for a breezy spring or crisp fall event. Enjoy an outdoor patio and fire pit and our indoor area with sliding doors and windows. This is the perfect place to let nature surround you as you celebrate your special occasion.   
  
Rush Pavilion: This open-air shelter surrounded by our greenway features a beautiful hardwood ceiling with a stone fireplace overlooking Lake Haigler. The Rush Pavilion is ideal for team-building activities, company picnics, birthday parties and intimate wedding ceremonies and receptions.
