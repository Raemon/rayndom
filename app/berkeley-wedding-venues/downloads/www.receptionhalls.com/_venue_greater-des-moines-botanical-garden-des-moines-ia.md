# Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden Des Moines, Iowa

Let the Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden be your destination for an upcoming event! As a progressive new cultural institution, the Botanical Garden provides a seasonally inviting backdrop for celebrations, receptions, and business meetings. In 2013, our 34-year old building received a facelift, transforming the visitor experience. The newly renovated spaces—including the expansive DuPont Room and two smaller spaces in the North Gallery—are perfect for guests to enjoy the tropics during Iowa’s weather extremes. Whether attending a business meeting or a formal celebration, guests can wander the gardens during breaks, enjoying the serenity of a lush tropical landscape. Iowa’s first living wall makes an impression as your guests enter the newly revitalized lobby. From your initial visit through the day of the event, your needs will be catered to by our skilled team of event coordinating professionals. For rates, details or to book the facility, please contact Chase Clausen or Jen Robbins, Guest Services and Events Coordinators at 515.323.6290. We look forward to working with you.
