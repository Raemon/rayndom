Host your special event at this unique setting with historic ambiance in a handsome modern facility and an exceptional courtyard garden. The design of the Sandy Spring Museum captures the architectural style and charm of the early 18th century Sandy Spring farm homes and barns. The museum and its architect, Miche Booz, received the Excellence in Design award for 1997 from the Potomac Valley Chapter of the American Institute of Architects.
