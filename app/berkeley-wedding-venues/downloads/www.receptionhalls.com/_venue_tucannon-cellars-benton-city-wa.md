# Tucannon Cellars Benton City, Washington

Sugar Pine Barn is truly one of a kind. Nestled between the skirt of the prestigious Red Mountain AVA and the Yakima River, surrounded by cherry orchards and vineyards, Sugar Pine Barn offers much more than just a facility, it offers an unforgettable experience.   
  
From the moment you walk inside you are immediately intoxicated with the aroma of incense cedar and sugar pine. The floors sparkle with quartz, sanded glass and polished stone. The walls and ceiling are comprised of blue knotted pine, each plank it's own piece of art.   
  
To make your experience more enjoyable, we supply all tables, chairs, linens, ample facilities, a catering kitchen and a sound system, all at no additional charge.
