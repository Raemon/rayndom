# Poplar Hall Appleton, Wisconsin

Poplar Hall can host anything from a seated event for 190 people to an intimate birthday for a dozen. We have two levels, a mezzanine and main floor. One idea would be a reception on the mezzanine and seated dinner on the main floor. Or if you’d like to have a smaller event, we could seat 40 on the mezzanine. In-house catering is available, but please reach out for a list of our approved caterers. We have a full video and audio system, so just bring your phone, plug in, and get ready for the funk. Or watch slides of next year’s sales projections. Your call.
