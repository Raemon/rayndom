# Galapagos Art Space Brooklyn, New York

Galapagos Art Space - about to become NYC’s first LEED certified 'green' cultural venue - has a 1600 square foot lake inside its building, complete with island seating and a beautiful wrap around mezzanine. Galapagos' dramatic elegance is enhanced by 200 candles attached to the walls and floating on the lake. Only half a block from the Brooklyn Bridge Park (think ceremony in the park with the Brooklyn Bridge and lower Manhattan as your backdrop!) Galapagos is nestled in the sunken cobblestone streets and beautiful vertical geography of DUMBO, Brooklyn – NYC’s most exciting neighborhood.  
  
Whether your wedding is 100 guests, or up to 250, Galapagos' ‘one price’ approach makes planning easy and covers everything you need including catering options. Galapagos offers a full bar, a full staff including in-house technicians operating a state of the art lighting and sound system, multiple seating layouts and all the production and planning taken care of by Galapagos' in-house wedding planners.
