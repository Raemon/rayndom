Our venue location-  
Elegant Assets Historical Event Center is a renovated 1932 schoolhouse venue  
blending vintage charm with the cutting edge services our clients have grown to love.   
The venue boasts a bridal suite with salon stations for getting ready, groom suite with corn hole and televisions, a lounge,   
rehearsal dinner suite, two patios and five acres of land complete with trails for photos!   
  
Whether it be just a reception, training event or a whole day suite and ceremony package,  
we are able to meet your every event need!   
With packages as low as $20pp and the ability to stock your own liquor  
we are able to blend your wants with your budget  
and create a package that checks all of your boxes -   
at a price you CAN afford!  
  
Whats even better is not only are we family owned and operated,  
but we also only accept one event per day, so the entire venue- including all 5 acres- is dedicated just to you!   
This means all of our staff, all of the property and all of the attention is all YOURS and your day isnt shared with anyone else at any time!
