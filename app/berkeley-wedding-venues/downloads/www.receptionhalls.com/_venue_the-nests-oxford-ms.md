# The Nests Oxford, Mississippi

Surrounded by lush gardens and peaceful countryside, our beautiful property is one of the most romantic and unique wedding venues in Mississippi. The Nests B&amp;B offers a variety of options for your ceremony, including a charmingly rustic red barn which can be utilized in the event of rain. Our rear terraced yard is the ideal setting for your Southern wedding, with a picturesque backdrop of gardens, forest, and green pastures. Brides love walking over our Fairy Bridge during their wedding procession!  
  
Farm weddings can be dressed up or down to match your unique sense of style and the scale of your wedding. Our property hosts exceptionally beautiful wedding receptions, with a built-in dance floor available for use and many options for tent placement. The farm kitchen can be made available as a catering staging room. Our B&amp;B spaces make the perfect preparation area for the wedding party with lovely rooms and a chic, vintage atmosphere.   
  
It would be our privilege to host your wedding! Prices vary based on the season, wedding size, and requested amenities.
