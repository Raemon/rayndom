About the Mansion  
  
Originally built in 1904, for the C.H. Alexander family, this dignified home is an exceptionally well-proportioned design of English inspired architecture with neo-classic influence. Acquired in 1930 by the Dallas Woman’s Forum, it was restored and redecorated in 1967. The front columns are constructed of Vermont granite and reach two stories high. The columns support the portal roof while surrounding the roof is a simple entablature. Wide steps lead up to the porch with built-in seats flanking each side. The huge double doors of patterned beveled glass are impressively beautiful.
