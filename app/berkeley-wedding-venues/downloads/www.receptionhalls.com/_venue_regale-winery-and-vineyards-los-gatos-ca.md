# Regale Winery and Vineyards Los Gatos, California

Inspired by Italian landscapes and Old-World villas, Regale Winery and Vineyards provides an opportunity to share the relaxed and sophisticated lifestyle that surrounds the production of wine in celebration of your wedding. Imagine saying your “I Dos” in the formal gardens, surrounded by lush greenery with fountains, an olive orchard, open lawn space and a bocce ball court complete with a view of the mountains. This space is perfect for an outdoor ceremony under the clear Californian sky. For your reception, you can utilize the gardens, in conjunction with the Outdoor Bar and Courtyard, which includes a covered portico with large granite tasting bar and a neighboring wood-fired pizza oven. The Vineyard patio offers another gorgeous outdoor space surrounded by Chardonnay vines and complete with market lights and a luxurious fountain perfect for an outdoor reception. For a romantic and welcoming indoor affair, the second floor dining room features a vaulted travertine ceiling, Italian fresco paintings, Venetian plaster, and ornate fireplaces to create an old-world Tuscan atmosphere. The room opens onto a heated, open-air terrace with breathtaking views of the coastal range and our formal gardens.
