# The Gressiwick Loveland, Colorado

The Gressiwick is The Sweetheart City’s newest and most modern old-world-charm event and concert space. Named for the married co-owners, Christina Gressianu and Vi Wickam, the 1905 building has been updated to modern-day event codes and expectations, while showcasing all of the vintage charm: oversized windows, exposed brick, and 12’ ceilings.
