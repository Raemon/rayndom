# At The Shire Huntsville, Texas

Located in the heart of the Sam Houston National Forest in Huntsville, TX, At the Shire is a unique outdoor wedding venue. Nestled in a secluded and enchanted woodland, this venue is perfect for boho weddings, engagement parties, and elopements. Exchange your vows on the leaf-strewn grounds and then retire to three chic and expansive tipis for a dreamy and one-of-a-kind celebration of love.   
  
Situated along a tranquil lagoon under a canopy of trees, At the Shire’s get-ready cottage is one of many picturesque spots at this breathtaking venue. The cozy house where you will prepare for the wedding is characterized by a sloped roof and quirky windows in varying shapes trimmed with green. The inside of this charming cabin features beautiful wooden walls, glittering chandeliers, and a spiral staircase to the second floor. Out on the steps leading up to the front door, you can take photos with loved ones with the adorable rustic exterior as your backdrop.   
  
Ceremonies take place in front of a “naked” tipi, whose poles rise into a conical shape and can be draped with florals or fabrics. This wooded glen is an atmospheric and romantic location to take the next step forward in your partnership. Afterward, you and your guests will follow a wooden path lit with bistro lights through the forest to the grand reception tipis. These magnificent open-air canvas structures boast large dance floors, twinkling string lights, sound systems, and plenty of room to set up tables for dinner. In the daytime, natural light will stream in through the sides, while at night, the stars will swirl above.
