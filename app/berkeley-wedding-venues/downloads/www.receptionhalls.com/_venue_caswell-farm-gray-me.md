# Caswell Farm Gray, Maine

Tucked away in Gray is the charming and rustic Caswell Farm. It is perfect for couples who dream of bunting, fairy lights, and dancing under the stars. This privately owned, 50-acre farm is nestled on a quiet country road. There are three grassy fields surrounded by beautiful hedgerows, which stretch out beyond our 300-year-old barn. Beautiful flower gardens provide unlimited photo opportunities!
