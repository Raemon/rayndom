# Rixey Manor Rixeyville, Virginia

Rixey Manor is a custom built Wedding Venue and Inn, within easy reach of couples in Virginia, Washington D.C and Maryland. Decorated with a relaxed elegance, it is one of the most romantic historic homes in the area, and the panoramic Blue Ridge Mountain views make it unique.   
  
  
  
  
The house has been a much loved family home for the last two hundred years - but it is currently undergoing some major rem. We aim to be open to guests by Summer/Fall 2014.  
  
  
  
In the house we will have four beautiful bedroom suites - all with clawfoot vintage tubs, roman faucets and luxurious bed linen.  
  
  
  
Two of the bedrooms will offer queen-size beds, and two will have king-sized, four poster accommodation.   
  
  
  
We have a elegant sitting-room where we will be serving high-tea at 4pm, including wine, cake and finger food. For breakfast (and other meals by arrangement) the dining room seats 16.  
  
  
  
  
We understand that when it comes to looking for a wedding venue you have many options. We are proud to say we are the only custom built wedding venue with spectacular views of the Blue Ridge Mountains and a roof top ceremony space to take advantage of them from.  
  
  
  
We are also one of the few exclusive use wedding venues in the USA. Which means everything that we have to offer is yours – and only yours. You will not be interrupted by other visitors, such as you would at a winery, hotel, or bed and breakfast that’s open to the public. Rixey Manor will be yours from Friday through Sunday, with everything we have to offer available to you. We also offer extra services such as vineyard tours, historical tours, or just fun games for the whole family to enjoy at the property. All you have to do is ask.  
  
While we are in the construction phase we ask that you please call Isadora (434) 996-4281 or email RixeyManor@gmail.com for pricing and more information. The first 5 weddings we book for the 2014/2015 wedding season will be discounted as a thanks.
