Mama Cozza's Italian Restaurant is one of a kind! We have been dedicated to serving fine Italian food for over 45 years, thanks to you, our special guests!  
  
You can enjoy an intimate dinner for two, a large family feast, a party in our Banquet Room or just come to watch a game in our lounge. We boast a full bar, a diverse wine list and special Italian desserts. Mama Cozza's provides not only outstanding food served by our friendly staff, but the atmosphere of a family owned and operated establishment.  
  
The family cooking secrets have been handed down over the generations. The freshness shows in every preparation, whether Northern, Southern, or in between ... It's just Italian! Everyone leaves satisfied… No one leaves hungry!
