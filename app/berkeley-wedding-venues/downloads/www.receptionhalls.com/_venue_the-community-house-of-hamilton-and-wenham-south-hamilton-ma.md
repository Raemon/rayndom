# The Community House of Hamilton and Wenham South Hamilton, Massachusetts

The Community House is a charming, historic building located in a traditional, New England community on the North Shore of Massachusetts. Located 3 miles off of Route 128, thirty minutes north of Boston, and 15 minutes from the Atlantic Ocean, our quaint community center, is the ideal setting for formal and informal functions.   
  
Our Main Hall, a charming room with beautiful, hardwood floors and a new baby grand piano, comfortably accommodates up to 120 guests for a sit down function, or 160 for a cocktail or audience style event. The hall reflects the taste and style of a 1920's ballroom and is the perfect setting for events of all kinds. Our Library. adjoining the Main Hall, has a beautiful working fireplace and original oak woodwork. The Library is the most intimate space in the building.   
  
All rentals include the set-up and use of our 60" round, 8' , and 4' rectangular banquet tables, 36" round sweetheart table, 36" cake table on wheels, and white Samsonite folding chairs. Chavari chairs may be rented for an additional fee. You may also contract use of the baby grand piano.
