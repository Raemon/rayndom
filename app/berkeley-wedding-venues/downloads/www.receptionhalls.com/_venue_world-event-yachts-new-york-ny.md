# World Event Yachts New York, New York

With more than 25 years of achievements in the luxury yacht and hospitality industries, Steven Tanzman has a rare depth of experience in the flawless execution of one-of-a-kind elegant events.  
  
Founded in 2003, his company, Yacht Events LLC, coordinates five-star cuisine, service and staged entertainment aboard world-class yachts along the East Coast. Clients and guests include billionaire George Soros, mogul Donald Trump, fashion icon Donna Karan, the Saudi Arabian Royal family, United Nations ambassadors and several world champion NFL-NBA-NHL and MLB teams.   
  
As president of Yacht Events, Mr. Tanzman regularly navigates the course separating success from failure, where months or sometimes years of planning come down to a few hours with countless details perfectly executed. He always meets the challenge, whether it’s a private yacht sailing to an unconventional docking spot or hundreds of staff and rentals coordinated and brought to an island accessible only by ferry. His events range from small family or corporate celebrations to large galas with over 2,000 guests.  
  
Clients praise Mr. Tanzman for being “beyond accommodating,” “thoroughly professional,” “exceeding expectations” and having a calming presence under pressure while coordinating the many moving parts that contribute to a successful event. Catering Trends Magazine named him “one of the leading consultants in the hospitality industry.” Twice the highly acclaimed Biz Bash organization recognized him as one of the top 10 event producers in New York City.
