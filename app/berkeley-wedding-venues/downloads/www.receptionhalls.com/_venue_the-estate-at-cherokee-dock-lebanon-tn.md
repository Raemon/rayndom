# The Estate at Cherokee Dock Lebanon, Tennessee

Originally built in 1960, the nearly 13,000 sq. ft. Southern Colonial mansion in Nashville, Tennessee, is most widely recognized as the former home of award-winning artist, actor, and author, Reba McEntire. In 2017, we opened our doors as a wedding venue and event center.  
  
Secluded on 13 acres of private property, The Estate retains the charm and grandeur you would expect, with original gardens, luxury stable, paddocks, guest house, pool house, eight-car garage, and more. It has undergone several renovations and additions over the years and now includes event spaces, both inside and out, transforming your unique day into a reality, all while being positioned on scenic acres of lakefront views.  
  
Just a 35-minute drive from the heart of downtown Nashville, you are able to absorb the peace and serenity of the Tennessee countryside, and still have the option to enjoy the nightlife of Music City.
