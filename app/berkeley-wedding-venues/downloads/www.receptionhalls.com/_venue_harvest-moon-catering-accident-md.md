MoonShadow Cafe began catering private events and weddings in 2014, with great success. As the demand for catering events grew, so did the need for more space. The Cafe decided to expand their catering operation by renting the old bakery in Accident, MD. Recently, MoonShadow Catering merged with Catering by the Champions, located in Oakland, MD., to form Harvest Moon Catering. We are currently in the process of building a brand new, energy efficient, state of the art kitchen located on the lower level of Harvest Moon Market in Accident, MD
