# Diamond's Edge Restaurant & Marina Portland, Maine

Great Diamond Island is one of Portland’s various islands accessible by the Casco Bay Ferry. Just a short ferry ride from the all hustle and bustle of downtown Portland awaits a peaceful New England setting at Diamond Cove.  
  
The venue itself sits on the beautiful island complete with a custom Sperry Tent site available for weddings and events. The tent boasts a built-in dance floor, protective ground coverage and retractable sides for inclement weather. The site unveils itself with an ocean view perfect for your ceremony and/or cocktail hour, a mirror pond that empties into Diamond Cove, along with a picturesque white Gazebo complete with full restroom facilities. The tent can accommodate up to 200 guests and has a minimum requirement of 75 guests.   
  
In addition to the Sperry Tent we have a more intimate event space typically used for smaller weddings around 25 to 60 guests otherwise known as the Art Gallery. With 40 foot vaulted ceilings, exposed wooden beams, and sliding barn doors on both sides, the Art Gallery is a unique and rustic venue option that we all love.
