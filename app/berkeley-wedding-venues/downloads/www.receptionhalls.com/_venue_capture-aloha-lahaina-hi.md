# Capture Aloha Lahaina, Hawaii

We are a small team of friendly, talented photographers who provide Maui photography. We specialize in wedding photography, family portrait photography, couples/engagement photography, maternity photography and high school senior portraits. We shoot on location usually at the beach, but can also come to your hotel-resort. We are based in Lahaina, but also travel to the Kihei-Wailea area. Our most popular and favorite session time is sunset, but we also offer early morning sessions. We use both natural light and off camera flash, a must in order to capture those gorgeous Maui sunsets and the bright, tropical colors morning sessions offer. We love COLOR and our photographs are vivid and bright.
