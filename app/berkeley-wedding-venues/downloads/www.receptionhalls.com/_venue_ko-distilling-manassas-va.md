# KO Distilling Manassas, Virginia

Our beautiful copper and oak trimmed, 2,500 square foot event center features a large Banquet Hall with a maximum capacity of 55 people. The Banquet Hall Rental agreement guarantees exclusive use of the Banquet Hall space for the duration of your event. Our Banquet Hall amenities include access to a large TV screen and Sonos sound system. The TV can be used to play video and/or slide show presentations, or it can be hidden away behind a sliding barn door style enclosure. There is a podium, with a microphone, available for use during your event as well. We also have a variety of folding tables and chairs that can be used to provide seating space for your guests, and their use is an included amenity within the rental agreement. Through the large glass windows of the Banquet Hall, the view of our state-of-the-art distillation and production facility is remarkable, and it would add a definitively unique atmosphere to your event.  
Additionally, your group would have shared access to our Tasting Room space during the event. The Tasting Room amenities include a handsome bar with comfortable seating for 9 people, as well as 4 small, round tables and a small lounge space, in front of the gas fireplace, with two large Chesterfield style leather couches.
