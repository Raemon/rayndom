# Lekai Ranch Paso Robles, California

Ceremony  
  
At Lekai Ranch you have the option of three beautiful ceremony and/or reception sites.  
  
? Our poolside views offer the amazing views of one of the highest points in the Adelaide wine country area. Private to your exclusive guests, this site offers a pergola, patio areas, grass areas, and the pool water for your lighting ambiance.  
  
? Our expansive grass areas face the rolling hills of Paso Robles vineyards and forested ranches. Large oaks grace the edge of the lawn that looks upon Halter Ranch Vineyards, the back of the Big Sur mountains and Hearst Castle Property.  
  
? Lastly our riding arena area is the ideal setting for those country chic weddings that enjoy the rustic scenery, the surrounding fields and trees, and a unique place to tie the knot!  
  
Our available Ranch House offers access to two rooms: The Bridal Suite and The Men’s Corner for Pre-Wedding preparation and privacy the day of the wedding.  
  
Reception &amp; Cocktails  
  
All of the ceremony areas can be turned into cocktail areas or reception areas depending on the size of your guest list. We welcome tent rentals for our riding arena area, which can fit up to 125 people or any outdoor celebration you desire. Each wedding is customized for the couple and is flexible upon certain guidelines.  
  
Please reach out to us for additional information or to book an appointment to see the site and get details.
