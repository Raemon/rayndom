Sunlit gardens & magic nights. You can feel the excitement the moment you step through our door - like the summer air flowing across a vineyard in ancient Greece or the daring beat of Flamenco dancers on a starry night in Spain.  
  
All the history and traditions of European elegance are captured here at Majestic Gardens, where you and your guests will be surrounded by a sense of enchantment in the air.  
  
It is all here – from our charming terrace gardens to the beauty of our glass enclosed Atrium to the majesty of our spectacular waterfalls.
