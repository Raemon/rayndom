# Cypress Meadows Estate Howell, Arkansas

Cypress Meadows Estate is located in Howell, AR just minutes away from Augusta. Built in the early 1900’s as an old stable barn, it has been uniquely converted into a fantastic event site. You are welcomed in with the wonderful scent of cypress and the relaxing rustic feel that accompanies the whole evening.

With sleeping accommodation for at least 35, The Drake Place Lodge has plenty of space to accommodate your entire wedding party and a few more.
