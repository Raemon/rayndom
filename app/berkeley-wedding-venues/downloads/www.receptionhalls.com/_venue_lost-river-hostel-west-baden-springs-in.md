# Lost River Hostel West Baden Springs, Indiana

An indoor/outdoor space by the river in a forest, we have the real magic and character that you won't find elsewhere. With treehouses, a labyrinth, gardens, farmhouse from the mid-1800s, swimming hole, bonfire spaces, rooftop bathtub, and lovingly cooked food. Presented by a compassionate staff with real personalities, your wedding will have the same care and whimsy that you'll find all over our property.
