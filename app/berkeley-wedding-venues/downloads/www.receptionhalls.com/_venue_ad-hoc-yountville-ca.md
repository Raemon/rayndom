Located in Yountville, Calif., Ad Hoc opened in 2006 as a temporary restaurant to showcase the American comfort food of Thomas Keller’s childhood. Eight years later, the restaurant and its seasonal addition, Addendum, continue to attract Napa Valley locals and visitors alike.  
  
The restaurant’s daily four-course menu, featuring classic American dishes found in the Ad Hoc at Home cookbook, is served family-style both to increase the conviviality of Ad Hoc and to emulate the casual comfort of home. Addendum focuses solely on buttermilk-fried chicken and barbeque lunches for picnics or take-out April through October.
