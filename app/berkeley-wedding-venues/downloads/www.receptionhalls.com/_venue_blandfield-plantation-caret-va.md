# Blandfield Plantation Caret, Virginia

Located in Essex County, Virginia, Blandfield Plantation is a historic landmark with two unique settings for weddings and special events.  
Couples interested in the elegance and rich history of the Georgian mansion, choose to exchange their vows in Blandfield’s recently restored formal rooms, or on its expansive lawn overlooking the rolling hills and sweeping view of the Rappahannock River. Nestled in a grove of hardwoods and evergreens, you and your guests will have a magnificent view of the property. After the ceremony, guests can stroll the path between the ancient boxwoods leading to the manicured reception grounds. During the reception, you and your guests will enjoy an evening under the stars and beneath a canopy of up-lighted trees.  
Those looking for a casual, riverfront setting choose to exchange their vows on the stone terrace behind our lodge, also overlooking the river. You and your guests will be in awe of the pristine marsh and spectacular views. Celebrate your reception under the covered pavilion, where you can enjoy the fresh, country air while dancing the night away.  
Create the wedding of your dreams at Blandfield!
