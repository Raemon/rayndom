# The Barn at 5S Ranch Thrall, Texas

The Barn at 5S Ranch is the perfect wedding venue if you're looking for a romantic, rustic, barn venue. We are located on a private ranch and feature an outdoor ceremony location overlooking the hill country + a barn reception venue with an open concept, decorated with string lights and wooden beams. You can bring in all your OWN vendors, and we will provide the tables and chairs. We also provide a Bride's House and Groom's Quarters to get ready in.
