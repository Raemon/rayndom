# The Henry Smith House Picayune, Mississippi

If you are searching for the perfect venue for your outdoor, Southern Wedding, look no further than The Henry Smith House. Our beautifully landscaped gardens, complete with fountains and colorful flora offer an unmatched serene elegance to you and your guests. Moss covered oaks spread out over our two acres estate provide an intimate atmosphere for you to say I do. You can hide from your groom behind the shabby chic double doors before you make your grand entrance down a 60 foot aisle made up of authentic old New Orleans brick that leads up to a white wedding pergola spilling with jasmine. Enjoy your reception under the magical lights strung atop our covered pavilion and attached pergola as you and your guests eat, drink, and dance the night away. The outdoor pavilion can also substitute for a ceremony area in the case of inclement weather. Picture opportunities are spectacular and endless. To complete your experience, we offer food packages starting at $18.95 per person. Our hors d'ouerves and meals are always prepared fresh on site. We can also customize a menu specific to your needs. Our professional staff will help you achieve your dreams for your special day. Call 601-749-8606 to schedule an appointment to come and visit with us.
