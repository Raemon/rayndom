# Willits-Hallowell Center South Hadley, Massachusetts

The Willits-Hallowell Center and Abbey Chapel are located on the campus of Mount Holyoke College. The campus is available to anyone looking for an all inclusive wedding destination. The Abbey Chapel is a breathtaking space for wedding ceremonies of any religious affiliation with seating up to 900. The Willits-Hallowell Center and Hotel is an ideal campus location with two dining rooms that have floor-to-ceiling windows that overlook Stony Brook. Receptions for up to 150 can be hosted, and your out-of-town guests can relax knowing that their hotel room is in the same building. The convenience of having your ceremony, reception and hotel space in one location allows for more quality time together and less traveling. Willits-Hallowell Center is also available to host rehearsal dinners and after-wedding brunches to make it a weekend affair with friends and family.  
  
The Conference and Event Services department delivers optimum customer service as befits the reputation of such a prestigious institution. Wedding packages include the coordination, catering, linens, centerpieces and a full liquor license.
