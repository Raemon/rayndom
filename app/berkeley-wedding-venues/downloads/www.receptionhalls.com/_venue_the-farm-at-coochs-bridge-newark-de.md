# The Farm at Coochs Bridge Newark, Delaware

Established in 1750 and thoughtfully restored in 2025, The Farm at Cooch’s Bridge blends centuries of history with timeless elegance.  
Nestled in the heart of the Cooch’s Bridge Historic District in Delaware, our venue stands on the grounds of the 1777 Battle of Cooch’s Bridge—the only Revolutionary War battle fought on Delaware soil. As a site listed on the National Register of Historic Places, it holds deep roots in American history.  
Today, we’ve reimagined this storied property as a space where people can gather, reflect, and celebrate life’s most meaningful moments. Whether you're planning a wedding, reunion, corporate event, or special occasion, The Farm offers a one-of-a-kind setting that honors the past while embracing your future. Come make history with us.
