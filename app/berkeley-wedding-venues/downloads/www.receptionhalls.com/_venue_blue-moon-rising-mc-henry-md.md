We have a unique resort and work diligently to provide an equally unique experience for you and your wedding guests. Our location is so naturally beautiful, you don’t even need to decorate (but of course you can if you’d like).  
  
While most wedding and reception venues move people in and out quickly, we understand the value of time spent with loved ones and insist your wedding isn’t a one day blur, but a multiple day event you and your closest friends and family will never forget.  
  
Many weddings are defined by stress filled late night or early morning decorating sessions and the essence of why you’re getting married is lost, not here at Blue Moon Rising.  
  
You and your guests will be able to arrive Wednesday evening and begin to settle into the resort for a long relaxing weekend. Thursday and Friday can be filled with preparing the ceremony site and decorating the tents to your heart’s desire. The community buildings included in your package will become the beating heart of the weekend and a place to enjoy time with those closest to you.  
  
45-75 people is the recommended guest list, 100 guests is our maximum capacity. This venue is perfect for an intimate wedding with your family and closest friends. Encourage your guests to turn your Deep Creek Lake wedding into a vacation and spend time with you at the resort throughout the week leading up to your big day!
