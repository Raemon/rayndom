# Cairnwood Estate Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania

If you are looking for a spectacular outdoor and mansion setting for your wedding, then come behind the high stone walls that seclude Cairnwood from the rest of the world. Here you’ll find the private estate of 19th Century industrialist John Pitcairn who created his elegant sanctuary. The result is an architectural masterpiece from the Gilded Age, Cairnwood.  
  
Brides will fall in love with this historical and magical setting. Because only one event is held per day at Cairnwood, with its grand staircase, balconies, private suites, and gardens, Cairnwood becomes truly “yours” for the duration of the event. It feels as if you are welcoming guests to your very own home: one that’s spacious and warm and can hold all those you love on this momentous occasion.
