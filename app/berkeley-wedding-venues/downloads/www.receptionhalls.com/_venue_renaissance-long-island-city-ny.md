# Renaissance Long Island City, New York

The Renaissance of Astoria, completed in 2003, is New York City's newest venue for inspired dining and celebrations. An architectural gem, the Renaissance features 7,000 square feet of spectacular bi-level dining. Imagine the panorama of romance as your guests dine atop our balconies, dazzled by views overlooking candlelit tables, 28 feet below. A marble staircase curves toward a gated and centrally located dance floor; strewn with candles and rose petals, there is no more beautiful place for your ceremony, no grander entrance to be made. Add to this setting lush drapery, a spacious European style lounge and, of course, cuisine as tantalizing and breathtaking as our space.  
  
State-of-the-art digital technology and an acoustically designed room have quickly made the Renaissance the premier stage for some of the world?s finest musicians. Your guests will enjoy the same studio-quality sound elegance. Our 24 x 24 feet video screen, DVD and VHS ready, also complements the rich sound with the broadcast of your life-history montage or the simulcast of your event. Our elevated stage is a delightful and uncommon place for your dais.   
  
But this is what we are about: uncommon dining and spectacular events. We design and host one wedding at a time, with all details tailored to your interests, heritage and tastes. Whatever your style, whatever your wish, the Renaissance has the storybook dreams for you.
