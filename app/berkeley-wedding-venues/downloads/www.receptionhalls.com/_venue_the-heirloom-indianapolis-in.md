# The Heirloom Indianapolis, Indiana

The Heirloom is located directly south of the Lucas Oil Stadium and boasts views in the heart of the downtown skyline. The venue is complete with the original brick walls, polished wood floors, and exposed beams making for a beautifully rustic ambiance for any event. The open concept layout and portable bar units allow for the ability to customize the space to fit your needs. The outdoor mezzanine/terrace makes for a great atmosphere for cocktail receptions. Not only do the all-glass garage doors provide spectacular outdoor sights, but they can be opened up to bring the fresh air in too!
