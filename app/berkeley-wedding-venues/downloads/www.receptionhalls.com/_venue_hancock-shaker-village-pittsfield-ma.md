# Hancock Shaker Village Pittsfield, Massachusetts

Hancock Shaker Village offers a distinctive place for your special event. Whether you're looking for historic ambiance or modern convenience, Hancock Shaker Village offers both. It's also a unique spot that will make your day memorable. We're set apart from the typical, bland event space.  
A scenic outdoor courtyard, art galleries, Leander Community Hall and a 60 x 100 ft. tent platform provide a variety of options from which to choose. If you are interested in a historic experience, a Shaker Supper is available as a luncheon or evenings in Shaker-style surroundings.
