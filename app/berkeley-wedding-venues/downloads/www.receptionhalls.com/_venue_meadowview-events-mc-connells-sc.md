MeadowView is a premier wedding and event venue located in scenic McConnells, SC. MeadowView features a brand new 9,000 square foot event hall and 50 acres of stunning landscape for weddings, corporate events, and other special event gatherings. Husband and wife team, Benji and Ali, are the proud owners of MeadowView. We came across this idea when we began searching for an affordable wedding location shortly after we were engaged in 2017. We were finding venues either had a great location but no amenities (i.e. a non-climate controlled barn in a pretty setting), or a nice banquet hall with amenities but no privacy or curb appeal. We realized that there were very few event venues in the greater Charlotte area that incorporated the best of both. After we got married, we were on a mission to create a wedding venue that checked all the boxes, and we searched for a year to find the perfect location. As soon as we drove down Garvin Road, we knew we had found the perfect location. Another important factor to us when we were getting married was the flexibility to choose vendors that fit our needs and our price point. It is for that reason that we offer a flexible vendor policy at MeadowView, allowing you to select the right vendors for your event. This gives you the ability to control costs and customize your event to your liking. Finally, we were passionate about constructing a building and an outdoor area that is beautiful in its own right. You are welcome to go as over the top as you like with décor, but if you choose to keep things simple, our building and landscaped grounds are beautiful enough to stand on their own as the perfect backdrop to your event. With MeadowView, there is no need to feel like you need to spend a fortune on decorations and floral arrangements. We are confident our building and our property is in a league of it’s own, which is after all, what you deserve for your big day.
