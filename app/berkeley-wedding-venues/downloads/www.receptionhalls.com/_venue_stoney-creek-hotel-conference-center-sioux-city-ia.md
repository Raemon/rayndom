Our River's'Bend Conference Center showcases ten meeting rooms of various sizes, to allow us to accommodate intimate groups very comfortably in our smaller spaces and at the same time, host groups banquet style for 525 and reception style for 700.   
  
Our large ballroom River's Bend Conference Center (Salon A, B, and C) divides into three rooms via air walls to house smaller groups, separate dining areas or breakout sessions. Each salon has a brand new sound system and is equipped with state of the art audio visual capabilities. We have a beautiful foyer at our separate ballroom entrance that is perfect to host pre-function receptions or a vendor area for large meetings. This area has a relaxing lounge complete with a large screen TV, fireplace couch and chairs.  
  
Our gorgeous chandeliers and urban contemporary atmosphere with rustic charm will enhance your corporate function, wedding reception or reunion. We work with a list of preferred caterers to offer you a wide variety of delicacies at a price to work with every budget. Other services may be scheduled for any group including full service bars, audio visual equipment and specialty linens. We are large enough to serve your every need, yet quaint enough to make you feel relaxed and at home.
