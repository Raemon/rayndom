# Machines with Magnets Pawtucket, Rhode Island

A unique and comfortable multipurpose space, Machines with Magnets features a minimal, midcentury modern-inspired aesthetic punctuated by custom furnishings and curated permanent artworks. The space consists of a working experimental music venue with full service bar; art gallery with rotating exhibitions, and a private, lighted, and furnished back patio available year round.  
  
The space can accommodate many different types of events including wedding ceremonies and receptions, showers, brand activations, birthday and other special occasion parties, team meetings, holiday and corporate parties, conference kick-off events, fundraisers, pop-up shops, and more.  
  
Our 2,000 square foot space is divided into two rooms: the venue, which features a staffed bar with cocktails, wine, and beer; a professional PA that can accommodate live music and DJ setups; HDMI projector; lighted dance floor; stage area, and high quality two-and three-dimensional permanent artworks. The second room is a flexible exhibition space that hosts rotating gallery shows, and can be used as a green room, lounge, or for dinner, dancing, breakout sessions, auctions, exhibits, and much more.
