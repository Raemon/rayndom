The Chrisman Manor is a beautiful event space and one of a kind Lawrence, KS rustic wedding venue transformed from a 4800-sqaure foot barn. The Manor sits atop 160 acres of rolling fields, one of the highest points of the Chrisman Farm. Grazing cattle are dotted over the gorgeous prairie landscape. We are event and wedding designers, specializing in giving brides spectacular weddings on a budget. The barn was designed with every bride in mind, our goal was to appeal to all couples getting married, we are not just for rustic weddings, in fact once you enter the barn you feel as though you have entered an elegant ballroom in the city. The spacious barn has been split into both a rustic-chic chapel and a gorgeous chic ballroom, allowing you to merge both your farm wedding and reception in separate spaces within the same venue. For those interested in outdoor weddings, we also offer a beautiful outdoor space overlooking our serene pond. Our goal is to to send your guest on a beautiful countryside journey, that will make your wedding day a lasting memory.
