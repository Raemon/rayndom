# Battello Jersey City, New Jersey

Our concept directs your attention to the bar, the center piece. A modern ship entering the building, originally an old boat house serving as the indoor and outdoor heated bar,allowing patrons to mingle and feel like they are in the modern marina atmosphere they are actually located in.  
  
The color tone and decor also lends itself to the modern nautical atmosphere. Large, clear plate glass windows allow for the spectacular views to be enjoyed. Close, friendly, adaptable seating gives you the feel of being on an ocean  
voyage in the main dining hall. Mild entertainment allows for "cheek to cheek" romantic dancing, further adding to the atmosphere.  
  
Michael Anthony's banquet room, capable of handling all type of events including wedding receptions, social, corporate or political events private parties and business conferences is complete with overhead projection and state-of-the-art sound system. Accommodating up to 250 people for either seated dinners or buffets. Michael Anthony's will also provide off-site catering.
