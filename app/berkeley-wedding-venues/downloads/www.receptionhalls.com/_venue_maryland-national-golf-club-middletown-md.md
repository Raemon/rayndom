### Venue Details

Capacity (Seated / Cocktail): **110 / 150**

Because we are a golf course and cater to so many different groups, we are flexible with our arrangements. This means we are able to offer a fixed boardroom space, our South Mountain Room, or the full facility for private events seating 12, 30, and 110, respectively. Alternatively, we can offer semi-private events for numbers of 30-60. A new option, available starting in September 2015, is an outdoor patio space seating 20-50 guests, and quickly expanding with the intent to seat over 100 guests in that space.

Max Number of Simultaneous Events: **1**

Outside Catering Permitted (BYO): **No**

Venue Type/Style: **Restaurant (Private Room), Bar/Lounge, Clubhouse**

On-Site Cuisine Options: **American, Sunday Brunch, Catering on site**

### Pricing

Budget Tier:  **$**

Minimim price for 100 guests: **$ 1,700**

Rather than using a room rental or room setup fee, as many venues choose to use, we instead utilize minimum expenditures. One of our greatest strengths is our ability to work with our guests to find a price point which works for both parties. Depending on time of year, time of day, day of the week, and number of guests, this minimum expenditure varies. Please contact me for more information regarding what this minimum would be for your event.
