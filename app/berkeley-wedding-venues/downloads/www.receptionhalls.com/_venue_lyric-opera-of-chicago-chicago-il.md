# Lyric Opera of Chicago Chicago, Illinois

Known as one of Chicago’s most prestigious and historic landmarks, the Lyric Opera House also provides soon-to-be-wed couples with a showstopping venue for their wedding day. Channel the drama of the opera with a ceremony or reception in the Ardis Krainik Theatre, complete with expansive stage, soaring ceilings, and ornate millwork that is sure to make a lasting impression on guests. Imagine hosting a beautiful banquet-style or cocktail affair in the stunning lobby, a grand space that showcases sky high ceilings decorative with hand-detailed ornamentation. The surrounding balconies, high-end fixtures, and ambient lighting combine to create an impressive atmosphere for your celebration. For a more traditional reception experience, look to the transitional William B. and Catherine Graham Room, or the lively European-style Florian Opera Bistro featuring an exciting collection of the Lyric’s photographs and costumes. For an intimate affair, look to the bright and opulent Malott Room or the moody and romantic Sarah and Peer Pedersen Room for your reception!
