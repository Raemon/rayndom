# The Gingerbread House Savannah, Georgia

The Gingerbread House,currently managed by The Mackey House is a beautiful Venue in the Victorian area of downtown Savannah, Ga, Also known as the Asendorf House, was built in 1899 and is considered one of the most outstanding examples of "Steamboat Gothic gingerbread carpentry" in the US. The house is commonly referred to as the Gingerbread House because of the elaborate gingerbread arches and spindles on the front porch and side balcony. It is one of the most photographed homes in Savannah, and has been featured in many films and publications as well as being visited by celebrities and US Presidents including Wilson Woodruff and Theodore Roosevelt.
