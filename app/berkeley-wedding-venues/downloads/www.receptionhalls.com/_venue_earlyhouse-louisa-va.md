# Earlyhouse Louisa, Virginia

Welcome to Earlyhouse, a private 150 acre estate in Louisa County, Virginia. Earlyhouse is the perfect destination for your plantation wedding, reunion or corporate outing. We invite you to explore our lavish countryside, our rich history and renowned Southern hospitality.  
  
Our restored home, built before the Civil War, is surrounded by expansive lawns, gardens, and natural woodlands. The centerpiece of the estate, a 2 acre spring-fed pond, boasts a lighted fountain and a beautiful island with flowering cherry trees, fragrant lilacs, and a rose covered arbor. Here, our one-of-a-kind gazebo is the perfect setting for a romantic outdoor wedding ceremony. A flock of white doves are released and soar overhead as you greet your guests as man and wife.  
  
Stroll back across the bridge to our all season pavilion with raised slate and brick terrace. Our pavilion welcomes guests with a charming fireplace, kitchen, attractive restrooms and is heated and cooled for year round comfort. A great place to celebrate, we can easily accommodate groups of 175 or more for your wedding reception, class reunion, or corporate outing. Other amenities include picnic grounds, walking trails, a playground and white sand beach.  
  
Situated in the rolling foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, Earlyhouse is convenient to Richmond, Charlottesville, and Northern Virginia.
