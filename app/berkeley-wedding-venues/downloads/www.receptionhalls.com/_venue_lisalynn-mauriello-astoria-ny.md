# Renaissance Event Hall Astoria, New York

Renaissance Event Hall caters to all your wedding needs in a sophisticated, upscale, luxurious fashion with elegance and grace. The space, with its award-winning interior design, is all yours, from balcony to lounge to Romanesque plaza. Here you will dine in the glow of alabaster lighting and soft golden marble, the warmth of Mahogany wood, and the paradox of wrought-iron railings fired so fine that they evoke gold-spun embroidery. Imagine a romantic cocktail hour on balconies and the vistas of candlelit tables 28 feet below, all set to the sounds of a baby grand piano at the top of the stairs. Add to this setting lush drapery, a spacious European-style lounge, and the world’s best culinary traditions. For parties between 50 and 275 people, The Renaissance Event Hall is sure to make your dream wedding day a reality.
