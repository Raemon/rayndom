# Reynolds Ranch at the Western Museum of Mining & Industry Colorado Springs, Colorado

The Reynolds Ranch at the Western Museum of Mining & Industry consists of the Farmhouse, Hay Barn, and Ore Building. The Farmhouse and Hay Barn are original to the historic period of the property. During this period the property was a dairy farm belonging to the Reynold’s family. A number of other historic farm buildings still remain here today.   
The current property consists of 27 acres overlooking the Front Range. Most of the land is undeveloped, offering a beautiful natural backdrop. The property is also home to the Western Museum of Mining & Industry, along with its collection of vintage outdoor machinery. With its easy access from I-25 and beautiful rustic charm, this venue is a true hidden gem of Colorado Springs.
