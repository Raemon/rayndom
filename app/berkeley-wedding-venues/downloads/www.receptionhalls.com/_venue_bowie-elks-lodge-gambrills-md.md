# Bowie Elks Lodge Gambrills, Maryland

It's a pleasure working with our staff here at Bowie Elks 2309. We are an organization run 90% by volunteers who wish to give back to our community. The large spaces we offer can be tailored to your needs and we are happy to help!  
We have excellent, non-volunteer, well-trained wait staff, bartenders, chefs available to our renters. We rent our space with guests in mind. Proceeds benefit the Bowie Elks and our charities. Each rental provides a sum of money for charity in our community!
