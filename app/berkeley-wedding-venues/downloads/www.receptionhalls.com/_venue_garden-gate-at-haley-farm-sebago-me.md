Originally built as a working farm c. 1817, Garden Gate at Haley Farm has become a unique location for couples looking to celebrate in all the beauty Western Maine has to offer - rolling mountains, deep pine forests, and a short drive from the shores of Sebago Lake. Whether you grew up in Maine, spent your summers on the lake, or are looking for a rustic setting for your destination wedding, Garden Gate creates the perfect backdrop encompassing rural New England charm at its finest.
