# Allegretto Vineyard Resort Paso Robles, California

Allegretto...Inspired and Crafted with Joy.   
  
Paso Robles introduces its first destination resort. The Allegretto is home to endless wonders but, most of all, this is where one finds joy. As you're swept into a rich tapestry of food, culture and endless beauty, you will feel a calming charge that connects you to what truly matters. Here, one enjoys artfully blended wines masterfully produced from grapes grown in the rich, delicate soil of our vineyard dotted hills. Allegretto is where the Chef knows every farmer and grower by name, creating a seasonal menu of pure and authentic local fare. As you tour the grounds, you will discover a cache of stories which offer an intimate peek at the passion and love that is the true foundation of the Allegretto.   
  
The result of this symphonic union of food, wine and Central Coast Artisans will unlock a hidden harmony deep inside you that will draw you back time and time again.   
  
That's because every inch of this estate was inspired and crafted to do one thing - elicit pure joy!
