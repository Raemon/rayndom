# Beverly Banquets Ontario, California

Congratulations!!  
  
My team and I are here to bring your vision and dreams alive. We can create a beautiful event saving you thousands of dollars. Why pay more? You can "do it yourself" by renting our hall with "The Duchess Package" (renting our couture linens and décor) or have us take care of all details for you with "The Queen Package". We are reasonable and responsible, giving you the confidence you need to enjoy your special day stress-free. We will pay attention to all details so you don't have to. You are welcome to come and tour our beautiful hall Monday through Friday, 11:00 am to 6:00 pm with a scheduled appointment. I have included the event specials we are offering for a limited time.
