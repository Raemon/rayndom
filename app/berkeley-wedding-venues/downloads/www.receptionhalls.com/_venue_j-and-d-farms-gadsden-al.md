# J and D farms Gadsden, Alabama

If you envision the vintage charm and simplicity of a barn wedding, or a reception under the warm glow of afternoon sun dappled through the limbs of vintage apple trees, look no further. J&amp;D farms can help you transform your wedding vision into an event that will be talked about for years. Located just 50 miles north of Birmingham, J&amp;D Farms is a privately owned 40 acre farm that sits conveniently on the outskirts of Etowah County, and just 15 minutes from Historic Downtown Gadsden. The barn is approached by a gently winding drive, and nestled among a small fruit orchard and organic vegetable garden. With its and beautiful heart pine reclaimed flooring, huge sawmill cut timbers and 26ft vaulted ceilings, the barn has the look, feel and design of a century old barn. It’s dramatic lighting and creative design is perfect for those seeking a natural yet elegant venue. J&amp;D farms is easily one of the most extraordinary and romantic locations for a wedding in the Southeast, but because this is a private residence, we only book a limited number of weddings each year. Please feel free to contact us for pricing and availability.
