# International Motorsports Hall of Fame Lincoln, Alabama

FOX SPORTS 1 DOME AT THE HALL OF FAME  
In 1996, the International Motorsports Hall of Fame’s Annual Induction Ceremony had a new date, a new site, and debuted in a brand new building. It marked the first time that the event had been held at the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in Talladega, and also unveiled the new 37,000 square foot FOX Sports 1 Dome, the largest building at the Hall of Fame complex. The induction ceremony took place on Thursday evening, April 25th, 1996 and was held before a record attendance. The ceremonies have been held at the FOX Sports 1 Dome at the Hall of Fame ever since. This year’s ceremonies guarantee to be one of motorsports’ highlights of the year.
