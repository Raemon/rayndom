# Crystal Room @The Robert Treat Hotel Newark, New Jersey

The Crystal Room at The Robert Treat Hotel which is situated in the heart of Downtown Newark, adjacent to the NJ Performing Arts Center with modern urban surroundings will give you that “big city feel” on your special day.  
Reminiscent of a bygone era, when ballrooms boasted lavish settings of crystal chandeliers and romantic candle light dinners, the newly remodeled Crystal room offers a dramatic change from the impersonal atmosphere of most ballrooms with its three-tier chandelier consisting of 30,000 hand-cut and polished crystals and technology which enables the chandelier’s color to be changed across the rainbow spectrum.  
  
Our banquet and catering staff is available to help guests plan every detail of their event. Maître D and Captains will oversee the actual event, ensuring that every attention to detail is covered. Our entire staff from bellmen to banquet manager is trained to serve each guest attentively, politely and efficiently.  
  
Our executive chef’s creations and customizable menus, weather a buffet or four course meal, will make your event a night to remember. Our full-service kitchen offers a wide variety of food and beverage options to meet any event's special needs. Our staff will assist individuals in making selections that are certain to please their guests. They will also assist with arrangements for those who prefer to enlist their own caterer.  
  
Consistent with our service-oriented philosophy, professional wedding planners are on-site to ensure that your event runs smoothly and efficiently. Let us help you make it a success!
