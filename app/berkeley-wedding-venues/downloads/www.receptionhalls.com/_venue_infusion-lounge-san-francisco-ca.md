# Infusion Lounge San Francisco, California

Located in the heart of San Francisco's Union Square, Infusion Lounge has transformed Bay Area nightlife and private events since its inception in 2009. As the most successful 5-star nightclub in the City, Infusion Lounge continues to showcase some of the world’s biggest DJs and hottest performing acts.  
  
Infusion Lounge was named by Condé Nast Traveler as one of the world’s hottest nightclubs shortly after it opened on New Year’s Eve in 2009. It quickly became the see-and-be-seen choice for both local glitterati and celebrities from music, film, television, sports and fashion.  
  
The 6500 sq. ft of entertainment space features private rooms, state-of-the-art sound and lighting systems, hypnotic LED-illuminated glass columns, and an exotic Asian-inspired interior with giant lacquer dragons, laughing Buddhas, and glowing lattice walls. Indulge in their extensive menu of signature cocktails, premium spirits, and Pan-Asian Fusion cuisine prepared under the direction of Executive Chef Evan Turner. Whether you’re joining them for dinner, nightclub, or a private event, Infusion Lounge is the perfect space for all of your entertainment needs.
