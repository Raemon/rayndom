The Mavris is a unique event space that promises to exceed your expectations. Built in 1883, the building's life started out as a grocery distribution terminal and later became a plumbing warehouse. On June 30, 1999, John Mavris, owner of Mavris Arts &amp; Event Center purchased the then abandoned building and began its rebirth to its original condition - all the while keeping his personal commitment to creating a new landmark for Indianapolis. The Mavris with its exposed brick walls, heavy timber construction, and renewed maple floors has been providing a unique urban event experience that is talked about across state lines.
