# Fort Smith Regional Art Museum Fort Smith, Arkansas

There are many advantages to planning an event at the Fort Smith Regional Art Museum, but the main one is this: no matter what you are celebrating, you’re surrounded by beauty. The award-winning building has so much style and history that you don’t have to add much to make your celebration dazzling.  
  
The stunning transformation from bank to museum was completed by Polk Stanley Wilcox Architects who were tasked with the job of repurposing an abandoned mid-century building into a 16,000 square foot state-of-the-art museum. The existing terrazzo floor was maintained in the lobby and the monumental staircase was also left untouched. The beautiful two-story Carrara marble support column was also left completely intact and is visible from the lobby. On January 10, 2014, the Fort Smith Regional Art Museum project was chosen for the Historic Preservation Alliance’s prestigious 2013 Excellence in Preservation through Rehabilitation Award. RAM was also awarded the American Society of Interior Designers (ASID) Gold Award for Commercial: Adaptive Reuse.  
  
Our two galleries and lobby lend themselves to standing receptions where guests can mingle, enjoy hors d’oeuvres and tour the latest exhibitions. Have the wedding ceremony here too, and prepare to be wowed: there’s nothing like a beautiful bride slowly coming down the terrazzo staircase, meeting her groom at the bottom to exchange vows in front of the Unity sculpture.  
  
From small and intimate to lavish, the Fort Smith Regional Art Museum offers the perfect setting for rehearsal dinners, weddings, receptions, board meetings, corporate events, social celebrations or almost any affair. Our facility rental prices range from $75 and up, and each package includes the use of our 1,200 sq. foot lobby.   
  
We hope that you will keep us in mind as a venue when planning your events. The historic and regal building that houses the Fort Smith Regional Art Museum is as captivating and dynamic as the art on view.
