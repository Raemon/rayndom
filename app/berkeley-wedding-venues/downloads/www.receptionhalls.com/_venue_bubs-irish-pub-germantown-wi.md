# Bubs Irish Pub Germantown, Wisconsin

Bubs Irish Pub is a very unique venue. At 15,000 sq. ft. and occupancy for over 800 people, we have several rooms to accommodate your group. This is a 110 year old site which has been completely redecorated over the past few years. Because we can provide all of the items you need (drinks, food, dj's, linens), we are known for our affordable rates, great food, inviting atmosphere and well trained staff... not to mention, it is a fun place. Unlike many halls, we are open until 2AM so we your group does not have to leave early.
