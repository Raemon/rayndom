# Big Chill, LLC. Charlotte, North Carolina

Big Chill has been creating great meals and memories for two decades. Big Chill originated as Charlotte's largest Classic Jazz /R&B/Motown supper club, hosting celebrity acts ranging from The Tommy Dorsey Band to John Legend.  
  
Giving in to the public's demand, Big Chill became Charlotte's Premier special events venue available for wedding ceremonies and receptions, corporate events, rehearsal dinners, holiday parties, birthday parties and much more.  
  
Our facility is over 13,000 square feet with a 1,000 square foot dance floor and built-in stage to keep your guests dancing all night long, and our Fireside Lounge has a built-in bar and is the perfect space to gather your guests for a little mingling before heading into the reception area to get the celebration started!  
  
Our customizable, all-inclusive dining packages can accommodate anything from stations, buffet, sit-down dinners, family style and anything in between.  
  
With our team of highly qualified professionals, you will always be in great hands. Our attention to detail, experience and reliability will ensure that your day is everything you dreamed it would be, and one you and your guests will never forget!
