The Aspen Room at Savage's new Environmental Learning Center (ELC) is perfect for your next event. The vision for the ELC was conceived on the concepts of good land-use ethics and environmental stewardship. The building is LEED certified and includes features such as vegetated roof, rain gardens, bathroom counter tops made from recycled plastic jugs, and ceiling made from seaweed and recycled wood shavings. The adjacent outdoor patio overlooks McColl Pond and is included in your reservation. Call our office for more reservation details.
