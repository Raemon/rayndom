# Agape Acres Dawsonville, Georgia

Agape Acres is the perfect place to hold events of all kinds including weddings, reunions, vow renewals, elopments, birthday parties, corporate events and other special events. Our modern, rustic, yet luxurious barn is spacious and ready for your personal touches to create your party's individual theme. The barn is an accommodating shelter from unexpected weather conditions and indoor space is climate-controlled. The barn and attached pavilion provides plenty of room for a banquet, ceremony, and dancing. Outdoors, the options are practically unlimited, with a lovely back drop of open pastures, a large pond, a beautiful courtyard surrounded by azaleas, wildflowers, fruit trees and completely surrounding by forest. Agape Acres will offer a memorable affair that you and your guests will talk about for years.
