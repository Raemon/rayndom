# Canyon Lake Resort Rapid City, South Dakota

Canyon Lake Resort is located on the west shore of Canyon Lake in Rapid City, South Dakota. Nestled in the foothills of the Black Hills, Canyon Lake Resort offers a restful and peaceful atmosphere.  
  
Join us at our locally owned, family-friendly lodges, motel rooms and cabins. While we have converted what was our event center into a lodging facility, the Reunion Lodge, it is now like renting an extra large home. The Reunion Lodge venue is perfect for family reunions and smaller gathering. The first level of the Reunion Lodge has 5 bedrooms, 3 1/2 baths, home style kitchen and sleeping room for 20 guests. The second level has 4 bedrooms, 4 baths, home style kitchen and sleeping room for 18 guests.   
  
Need more space? With 6 two bedroom cabins, 11 motel rooms, 3 studio cabins, a 3 bedroom cabin and a 5 bedroom house there is plenty of room to acommodate your families.  
  
Enjoy your day out exploring the beautiful Black Hills, whether it is trout fishing, walking, biking or paddleboating on Canyon Lake. Then enjoy your evenings relaxing around the campfire toasting s'mores.  
  
Welcome to the Black Hills. Come be our guests.
