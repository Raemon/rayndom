# 48 Wall Street New York, New York

48 Wall Street provides a unique and historical setting to host your next corporate or milestone celebration.  
  
Located in the heart of the Financial District, the 48 Wall Street event space occupies three floors of the former Bank of New York & Trust Company Building. The current structure is the third to be erected on the same plot. The cornerstone was laid on January 12, 1928, the 171st birthday of the banks founder, Alexander Hamilton.  
  
The Grand Mezzanine Banking Hall has retained much of its original architectural detail and boasts 30-foot ceilings, Palladian windows, and an elaborate entrance leading to a grand marble staircase. The London & Amsterdam Auditorium, on the concourse level, is also available for lectures and conferences that can be divided into six smaller rooms for breakout sessions.  
  
48 Wall Street was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 2003.
