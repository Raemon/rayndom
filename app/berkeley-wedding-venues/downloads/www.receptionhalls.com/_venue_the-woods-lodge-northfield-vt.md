# The Woods Lodge Northfield, Vermont

Nestled in the foothills of the Green Mountains, The Woods Lodge offers a cozy, rustic charm that blends perfectly with its natural surroundings. The building itself is a circa 1920 structure built originally as the Main Lodge of an historic summer camp, with windows that frame views of rolling hills and dense forest. Inside, the venue is warm and inviting, with exposed wooden beams, a stone fireplace, and soft, ambient lighting that creates a welcoming atmosphere.
