# Morrison's Rogue River Lodge Merlin, Oregon

A Wedding at Morrison’s Rogue River Lodge  
nestled in a serenely beautiful bend on the Rogue River is a great choice for couples who want a wedding destination spot.  
  
Our truly spectacular setting includes a river front lawn surrounded by tall pines, a pristine view of the river and a myriad of wildlife. Your uninvited guest list might include our semi year resident bald eagles, great blue heron, osprey, snowy egrets, Canada geese, and numberless migrating song birds. You might even glimpse our pond’s beaver   
and local black tail deer.  
  
With the river canyon as your back drop and open air seating,  
your wedding ceremony will take place in a peaceful,   
serene and wildly beautiful setting.  
  
Your reception will take place under the tall pines catered by Morrison’s creative kitchen staff. You will be attentively accommodated by our experienced personnel.  
  
Whatever your desired celebration may be, you can create lasting memories of your “I do” and begin your life together  
as the sun sets on the Rogue River.
