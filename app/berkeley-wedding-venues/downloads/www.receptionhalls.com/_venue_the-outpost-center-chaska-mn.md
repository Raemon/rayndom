# The Outpost Center Chaska, Minnesota

The Outpost Center is an award winning Barn/Farm wedding and reception venue located on 27 glorious acres right in the western metro! You simply must come see it!   
  
• Romantic! Fun! Elegant! Down to Earth! These are the most common ways Brides have described The Outpost Center!!!  
• Choose from two outdoor ceremony sites; a manicured lawn setting or mowed field surrounded by grasses and wildflowers!   
• Move freely about the outdoor space during your social hour; enjoy the picturesque farm scenery while playing lawn games!   
• Our temperature-controlled building houses the interior reception space that has a charming barn atmosphere overflowing with rustic elegance!   
• We have 3 restrooms, a Bridal Loft like no other, a room for the groomsmen as well as a kitchen for your own caterer!  
• Don’t forget to ask about our new reduced cost, "Venue Only", option!  
• Getting married in less than 6 months? Our CURRENT SPECIALS will bless you and your wallet!  
  
Your decision to have your wedding at the Outpost supports our mission of being a place where the Spirit of the Lord anoints all who enter to truthfully proclaim and share restoration and freedom in Christ! Through the power of the Holy Spirit, we feed, teach, train, equip and disciple as God leads (Luke 4:18, Isaiah 61:1-3). Our vision is that the Outpost will be a place where all people experience a foretaste of heaven on earth!
