# The Center at 2300 Sacramento, California

​The Center at 2300 was formed in the hopes of allowing our community a place to unwind, relax, and celebrate their momentous occasions. Though originally envisioned to host the community of the Mosaic Law Congregation, the reach and scope of events held by The Center at 2300 quickly grew to many organizations and groups within the Sacramento region and beyond. From 2015 to now, we have grown exponentially in both our scope of work, and ability to craft memorable experiences.  
  
What is it about The Center at 2300 that has allowed us to grow to the scale we have over the years? Perhaps it is that community-improving desire at the core of each event we hold? Perhaps it is the stunning space we provide, along with the right combination of aesthetics and amenities? Or maybe it is the wholesome, personalized touch each member of our staff give to the guests that attend each event? Whatever the case may be, The Center at 2300 has become a staple of the Sacramento region’s events space.  
  
Our facility offers many things other venues simply lack by design. A full theatrical stage? A lavish perk included at no extra cost. Almost 40ft tall ceilings? An amenity rarely found in most events spaces. Integrated, full-color, ambient lighting controlled at the touch of a tablet? We have it, and we know how to use it!  
  
Tremendous value, impeccable service, and most importantly, a strong desire to create lasting memories for every guest and client that enters our space. These are the core motivations that we at The Center at 2300 hold true to with each event we host.
