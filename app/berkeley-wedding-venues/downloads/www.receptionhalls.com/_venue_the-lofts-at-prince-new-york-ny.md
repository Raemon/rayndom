# The Lofts at Prince New York, New York

The Lofts at Prince are reshaping the landscape of corporate hospitality and event planning in New York City. Located in historic Soho, The Lofts offer the amenities of a high-end Midtown event space in a neighborhood steeped in culture, fine dining and artistic expression.   
  
We will arrange the space to your individual specifications and will ensure that your event runs smoothly. It is our mission to provide you with exemplary service and a unique Manhattan experience. Leave the stress of Midtown behind and immerse yourself in the luxury and peace of Soho.  
  
The space featured hardwood floors, working fireplaces, built-in kitchen and a rooftop deck with unobstructed city views. Perfect for intimate weddings, corporate events and meetings, private affairs and event outdoor BBQs!   
  
The Loft does not offer on-site catering, but outside caterers and event planners are always welcome! We can recommend a preferred caterer and also allow all types of insured outside caterers to serve food/beverages and use its chef's kitchen and rentals.
