# Warwick Allerton Hotel Chicago Chicago, Illinois

The Warwick Allerton Hotel, Chicago was constructed in 1922 and opened in 1924 at a cost of $4 million utilizing the rare Northern Italian Renaissance Revival design created by the famous Chicago firm, Murgatroyd &amp; Ogden Architects. It was the first 25-story skyscraper built on North Michigan Avenue and the only building with dramatic exterior setbacks, towers, upper story design elements, carved stone details and picturesque rooflines evocative of 14th and 15th century Milan and Verona Italy.  
The hotel was originally a men’s only residence, owned by the Allerton House Company, a national chain of residential “club hotels” that provided young professionals with the service of a hotel and the sociability of a private club. By 1930, the Chicago Allerton House accepted women tenants and was comprised of twenty floors –with fourteen floors for men and six for women – each with separate elevators, for a total of 1,000 small apartments. An early resident was William Wrigley Jr. who later founded a chewing gum company, bought the Chicago Cubs, and built a ballpark in his namesake.  
In the 1940’s through the early 1960’s, the “Tip-Top-Tap” was a legendary cocktail lounge and club that was once the hub of Chicago nightlife and celebrity sightings. Many live bands, singing groups, comedians and entertainers performed here. During the 1950’s, it served as the home of Don McNeill’s nationally broadcast “Breakfast Club” radio show, featuring celebrity guests such as Lucille Ball, Jerry Lewis, and Jimmy Stewart. The Tip-Top-Tap lounge closed in 1961.  
From its inception in the early 1920’s, The Warwick Allerton Hotel, Chicago helped bolster the redevelopment of North Michigan Avenue into a chic boulevard of exclusive shops, clubs, offices, and hotels. Since then, the hotel has undergone more than $85 million in renovations, including the $12 million updates completed in Spring 2008. Today, The Warwick Allerton Hotel, Chicago and its 443 guest rooms serve as a reminder of Chicago’s long and colorful history. Nothing better exemplifies this as the neon ‘Allerton’ and ‘Tip-Top-Tap’ signs a top the hotel, which remain as iconic symbols on the Chicago skyline.
