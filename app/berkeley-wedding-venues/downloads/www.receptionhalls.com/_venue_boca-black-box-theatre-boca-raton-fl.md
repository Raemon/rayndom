# Boca Black Box Theatre Boca Raton, Florida

Hello and welcome to the Black Box Center of the Arts venue!   
  
We are a theatre by day, but by night, we can turn into a nightclub, wedding venue, bar mitzvah, a unique place to hold a meeting, an entertaining space, or several of the above! Seriously, we've held wrestling matches in our venue.  
  
We are conveniently located West of the Turnpike and a 10-minute drive from I-95, with a lot of hotel accommodations in the area for all your guests.  
  
We can talk about food, but we have different alcoholic drinking packages to really create a party. Price per person is contingent on this very important decision.  
  
We are excited to talk to you and help your event become a wonderful memory!
