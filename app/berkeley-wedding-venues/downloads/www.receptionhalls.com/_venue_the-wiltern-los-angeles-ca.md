Set beneath the theatre’s famous rotunda cove ceiling and chandelier, The Wiltern’s 6,000 square-foot Main Lobby can transform with ease from a cocktail reception to an elegant wedding to the entrance for a rock and roll show. Step and repeats, photo booths, merchandise tables and sponsorship activations typically find home in the Main Lobby, where banners can easily be hung from our rotunda balcony, making the space optimal for branding and logo activation.

Beautifully art deco, with ample soft seating, high communal tables and bar stools allows for guests to relax or roam as desired. Private bar, high definition TV screen and DJ setup complete the space to allow you to further customize as needed. Options to have VIP seating in the balcony with direct access from Emerald Lounge to further enhance the experience for guests.
