# WISEACRE BREWING- OG (Broad Ave) Memphis, Tennessee

Located along the train tracks in the heart of the historic Broad Avenue Arts District, our three unique private event spaces can be transformed to create any environment you want. Whether formal or casual, WISEACRE is a great place to host your next birthday party, company get-together, wedding ceremony or reception, and more!  
  
Our main bar area, ideal for groups ranging from 30 to 300. The Taproom features a private bar, large tables for communal seating, a large barn door that opens to the patio for an indoor-outdoor vibe, and floor-to-ceiling windows allowing guests to check out our full-time, working brewery behind the glass. This space is great for meetings and parties lasting up to 4 hours and includes access to the patio and outdoor games, as well as control of our AV/PA systems (screen and projector, mic and speakers to blast your playlist), and plenty of room for activities. Taproom rentals close the brewery to the public, so the space is yours and yours alone! With 19 beers on tap, including both our year round and seasonal beers, guests can drink the WISEACRE they already know and love as well as try something new and exciting!
