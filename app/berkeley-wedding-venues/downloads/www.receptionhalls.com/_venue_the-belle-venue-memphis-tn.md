# The Belle Venue Memphis, Tennessee

The Belle Venue historical cruise themed event facility is the perfect place. This vintage ballroom with its majestic riverboat theme and historic elegant flair is a hidden treasure of the city. The riverboat themed facility was originally built in 1973. It was a hospitality venue as the Schlitz Belle and later operated as the Stroh’s Belle and later Coors Belle which is now known as "The Belle Venue". The Belle ballroom emulates an elegant riverboat overlooking a hand-painted mural of Mississippi River boats from yesterdays. The hand-crafted ceiling, tables and chairs, along with antique chandeliers and wall-mounted sconces reflect a Riverboat Theme while offering an incredible river view.  
  
The historical landmark Grand Ballroom offers guests a grand facility for wedding, receptions, anniversary dinners, corporate events, galas, conferences, quinceanera, reunions, theme parties, proms, and more.
