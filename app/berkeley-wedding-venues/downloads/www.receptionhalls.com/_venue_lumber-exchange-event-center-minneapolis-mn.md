We are Downtown Minneapolis’ most versatile venue, located at the intersection of Hennepin Avenue and South 5th Street in the dazzling Lumber Exchange Building.  
  
The story of the Lumber Exchange Event Center all started with a simple idea. Host larger more elegant events and do it in a way that would change the way Minneapolis looked at event space. The owner saw the need for this space after years of developing The Pourhouse  
  
restaurant as the place to watch televised sports events, eat great food and dance the nights away on the weekends. However, its prohibition-influenced design and large space showed strong potential for events and celebrations of all kinds. As the Pourhouse flourished into a successful event venue, we discovered the third-floor space in the Lumber Exchange Building that was an ideal larger event and wedding venue. The Lumber Exchange Event Center is the culmination of that vision.  
  
To cater to upscale, swanky socialites of Minneapolis, we opened The Exchange & Alibi Lounge. This modern, sophisticated space attracted happy hour goers and night time clubbers and provided us with additional space to host events like wedding receptions, cocktail hours and corporate parties.  
  
Our unique group of spaces and services take the stress out of event planning, allowing you to enjoy the experience. No matter the size, budget or occasion, we can turn your dream event into a reality.
