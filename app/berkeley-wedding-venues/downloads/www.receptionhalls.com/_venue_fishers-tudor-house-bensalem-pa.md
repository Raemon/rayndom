# Fisher's Tudor House Bensalem, Pennsylvania

Fisher's Tudor House philosophy is that there is no substitute for good tasting food, presented beautifully and generously. But, it is not about our personal tastes, it's about yours. Each reception is tailored to your special needs and requests. From incorporating grandma's favorite recipe or that special dish from a Gourmet Magazine, we will endeavor to make your day special. That's what we do, use our knowledge and experience to create an occasion that reflects your entertaining style and personal taste. Our dedication to this commitment over the years has been instrumental in our continuing success and growing reputation.  
  
It takes more than just daily fresh ingredients to prepare a festive dish. Likewise, a capably trained staff of expert chefs does not always guarantee a successful affair. What is necessary is dedication and a quality product topped with the most important staple of all...service, service, service.   
  
Our organization consists of a staff of dedicated professionals who can bring that special touch to any affair. We are fully experienced in what is required to make sure your party is one that both you and your guests will enjoy. We are your wedding coordinators, your liaison between the entertainment and the photographer. Let us show you how you can really be "a guest at your own party." It all starts with a phone call. We take care of the details so you can relax and enjoy yourself.  
  
We are experienced in handling all types of functions- Reunions, Luncheon and Dinner meetings, Trade Shows, Seminars, Exhibitions, Cocktail Parties, Retirement parties, Wedding receptions, Wedding ceremonies, Bar/Bat Mitzvahs, Rehearsal dinners, Fashion Shows, and the list goes on. Once you place your special function in our hands you have no more worries about the success of your affair.
