# Whitesbog Historic VIllage Browns Mills, New Jersey

Located in the Pinelands National Reserve, Whitesbog Historic Trust provides the perfect place for Weddings, Family Reunion, Birthday Party, or other such gatherings.   
  
Whitesbog Village is a historic company town and farm with 25 historic buildings, blueberry farm fields, cranberry bogs, hiking trails, reservoirs, streams, a picnic grove and the Elizabeth White Gardens. In the early 1900’s, Whitesbog was the largest cranberry farm in New Jersey and its founder, Joseph J. White, was a nationally recognized leader in the cranberry industry. In 1916, Elizabeth C. White collaborated with Dr. Frederick A. Coville of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and successfully developed the first cultivated blueberry here at Whitesbog. Elizabeth developed a nursery here, built her home, Suningive and her gardens of native Pine Barrens plants.  
  
Whitesbog is an important part of New Jersey history and the history of the blueberry and cranberry culture in the United States. It is listed on both the National and State Registers of Historic Sites. Whitesbog includes the village and the surrounding 3,000 acres of cranberry bogs, blueberry fields, reservoirs, sugar sand roads and Pine Barren’s forests.
