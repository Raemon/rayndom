# Savoy Denver Denver, Colorado

The Savoy Denver occupies the second floor of a landmark Victorian building. The buidling was constructed in 1889 and resides in the historic Curtis Park Neighborhood. The Social Hall was used as a private social club, and as a vanilla factory. Today, it remains as one of the few surviving spaces of its kind in the city of Denver.  
  
A short walk from Coors Field, adjacent to the RiNo Arts District, the building was renovated in 2021. The Social Hall retains its original pressed tin ceilings which are illuminated by the original nine foot windows that offer city views.   
  
Offering affordable rates and a capacity of up to 150, the Savoy Denver is able to accommodate a wide range of theatre, dance, performance, and social uses.
