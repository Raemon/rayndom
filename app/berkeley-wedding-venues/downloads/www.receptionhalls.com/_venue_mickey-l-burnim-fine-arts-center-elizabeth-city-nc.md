# Mickey L. Burnim Fine Arts Center Elizabeth City, North Carolina

MICKEY L. BURNIM FINE ARTS CENTER, built in 1999, is a 2-story, 55,500 square ft, air-conditioned building. The classroom portion, housing the Music and Art Departments, has labs, offices including Office of the Dean of the School of Arts and Humanities, studios, ensemble rooms, and restrooms.   
  
An amphitheater lies between this structure and the attractive Floyd L. Robinson Auditorium. The Auditorium portion of the center contains personnel and orchestra lifts and has a seating capacity of 1,007, including its balcony. There are advanced facilities for sound and lighting. The auditorium’s lobby has one elevator and an eye-catching “floating” staircase. A unique feature of this Center (in addition to the retention pond on its grounds) is art work forming an integral part of its construction - thus far the only campus building with such adornment.
