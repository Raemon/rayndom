# Bouchon Bistro Yountville Yountville, California

The first of three Bouchon properties within the Thomas Keller Restaurant Group, Bouchon opened in 1998, just four years after The French Laundry. The restaurant offers French bistro fare and has received numerous accolades from both the culinary community and national press, including a one-star rating from Michelin Guide San Francisco and being included in the San Francisco Chronicle’s “Top 100 Bay Area Restaurants” since 2000.  
  
Bouchon’s bistro fare changes with the seasons, and though their presentation may change, some of Chef Keller’s favorite dishes remain as fixtures on the menu: roast chicken, steak frites, croque madame, pot de crème and lemon tart. The restaurant also features an extensive raw bar,  
a seasonal Vin de Carafe program highlighting local winemakers and an extensive, international wine list complements the restaurant’s cuisine.
