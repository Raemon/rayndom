# The Wagon Box Story, Wyoming

![Photo of The Wagon Box](/media/WY/14232/the-wagon-box-story-wy.jpg)

Set against a backdrop of the natural beauty of the Bighorn Mountains, The Wagon Box is an event center that features a beautiful barn wood family-style bistro with live music every weekend.  
The lodging at The Wagon offers an array of experiences, catering to different tastes and preferences for tranquility and comfort amidst nature. With options ranging from cozy cabins and glamping tents to tipis and more structured lodge rooms, to cover a spectrum of rustic charm to more polished retreats. Each accommodation type, like the Creekside Chalet, the Roosevelt Suite, or the various campers and tents, has its own unique character and amenities, often accentuated by the natural beauty of the surrounding area.   
The food from the Wagon Box has been characterized as classic American comfort food with a gourmet twist. The menu includes hearty meat dishes, like Prime Rib and Buffalo Short Rib, with a focus on substantial, satisfying plates. There's also a range of small plates like Crostini Buffalo Bites, indicating an interest in shareable, appetizer-style dining. Options such as the Wagon Burger and Country Fried Steak lean towards familiar, homestyle meals, but with unique elements like the Wagon Sauce and the habanero-honey sauce, we offer a distinctive taste specific to the Wagon Box. The incorporation of ingredients like parmigiano, arugula, and heirloom tomatoes in other dishes shows our appreciation for quality produce, possibly with a farm-to-table approach.  
It is a place where minds meet to explore and build. A mix of literary, agricultural, and local events paired with activities like cold plunges, sauna sessions, and shared meals with local brews encourage a blend of relaxation and lively conversation.
