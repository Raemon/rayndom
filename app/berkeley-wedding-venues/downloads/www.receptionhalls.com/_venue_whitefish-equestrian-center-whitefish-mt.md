# Whitefish Equestrian Center Whitefish, Montana

You don’t need to be more comfortable in boots than high heels to fall head-over-heels for this very special wedding and event venue. Situated on a gentle rise at the Whitefish Equestrian Center (WEC), The Glacier Room has a graceful, storybook charm that’s as right for a rustic farmhouse gathering as it is for a chic Derby Day.  
  
With its sense of seclusion and unhurried vibe, this site is definitely a breath of fresh air. The property’s expansive view of the surrounding mountains, large pastures, broad lawns, and meticulous landscaping lend an immediate air of sophistication to the scene. The showcase-quality, 30 horse stable—complete with handsome thoroughbreds and warm bloods—celebrates the high-end equestrian lifestyle. It’s perfect for all kinds of functions, from fancy fundraisers to company shindigs, but naturally our top choice for this location is weddings.
