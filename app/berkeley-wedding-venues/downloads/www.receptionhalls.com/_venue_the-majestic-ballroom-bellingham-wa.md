# The Majestic Ballroom Bellingham, Washington

The Majestic Ballroom is a two-story, downtown Bellingham event venue that makes for a romantic wedding spot, an elegant ballroom for quinceaneras, a wide open space for a concert or benefit, or even a great place to rent a meeting space.  
  
This historical landmark features high ceilings and beautiful architectural details including oak floors. With nearly 4,500 square feet, The Majestic can accommodate up to 350 guests for dining events and up to 450 people seated theater style – plenty of room for great music and dancing.  
  
Decorated elegantly, yet simply, the space works well as-is or with outside decorations.  
  
An abundance of private rooms are available within the space for classes, meetings, event preparations, storage, and changing.
