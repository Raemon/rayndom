Primm Valley Resort and Casino offers incredible weddings at an amazing and affordable price. We are unique in many ways, but the one that stands out the most is our location. We are located at the California/Nevada State Line which sets in both states. Our property also includes three resorts to choose from and the #1 Lotto Store in the country. We are a short drive away from Las Vegas, so if you're wanting to enjoy a night out before or after the wedding, but have a relaxed wedding outside of Vegas, Primm is the perfect place.
