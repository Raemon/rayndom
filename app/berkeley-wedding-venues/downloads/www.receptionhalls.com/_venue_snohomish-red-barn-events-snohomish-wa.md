# Snohomish Red Barn Events Snohomish, Washington

Stocker Farms is nestled in the beautiful Snohomish River Valley, just outside historic downtown Snohomish, with stunning views of the Cascade Mountains. Our wedding and events venue offers rustic simplicity, and features a classic red barn, wide-open spaces and plenty of country charm…the perfect place to gather with friends and family. Our special occasion canopy seats up to 180 at our own wooden tables; we have a flower garden area that is perfect for ceremonies under the sky. Children welcome! There’s plenty of room on the grounds for kids to run and play and have a great time!
