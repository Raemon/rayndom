# Rutgers Gardens New Brunswick, New Jersey

The Rutgers Gardens are a series of enchanting gardens tucked away on the campus of Rutgers University—the perfect spot for your romantic wedding ceremony and reception. From early Spring to early Fall, Rutgers Gardens provides a beautiful oasis of trees and flowers, making it the perfect place for your ceremony and photographs. Offering a gorgeous natural landscape and romantic and inviting rustic features, Rutgers Gardens is perfect for a relaxed and fun yet perfectly elegant wedding ceremony and reception. Imagine a ceremony in the Evergreen Garden where you will walk down the grassy aisle toward a dark wooden altar to say your “I Dos” with your beloved, all while your friends and family gaze on in love and awe underneath the beautiful, clear sky. Following the stunning ceremony, you can invite your guests to eat, drink, and dance at the Log Cabin and Pavilion, which offers an even more rustic and unique atmosphere for your celebration. The beautiful natural outdoor settings are complete with a historic Log Cabin with Weston Mills pond as the backdrop. With twinkling fairy lights and whimsical gauzy fabric, your wedding celebration will be remarkable.
