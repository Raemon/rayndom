# Park Chateau Estate and Gardens East Brunswick, New Jersey

Visualize your once in a lifetime wedding day as you might if you stepped into a classic French Romance Novel. The elegant drive leads you into the courtyard and your first steps into the Chateau. Dreams become reality as you are drawn across the stone courtyard which provides you the first view of the Park Chateau where you will celebrate. The doors open and you glide into the foyer where your guests will arrive to be greeted by white gloved servers &amp; champagne.  
  
The ceremony for your wedding can be performed just steps away from the main house at the Park Chateau’s charming private chapel. Imagine yourself sipping Cocktails on the flagstone patio as you and your guests take in the panorama of the view beyond the Chateau’s gardens and feast on an elaborate cocktail hour menu that would awe even Louis the XIV.   
  
Adorned with classic French Antiques, each piece in itself is exceptional, unique and chosen for the Chateau. These original pieces add charming detail and delightful ambiance to the Chateau’s own architecture and grace. The décor and architecture evoke the illusion that one has traveled much further than a short drive from Manhattan, and are somehow transported magically to the French countryside.   
Then step into the very Grande Ballroom, exclusively yours for one affair at a time. Silver place settings gleam, the champagne glasses sparkle as you and your guests toast to celebrate the beginning of your lives together. Magnificent crystal chandeliers glisten throughout the stunning ballroom, dramatic crown jewels set in one of the most chic and sophisticated settings that together with the fantastic food and service will leave your guests breathless!  
  
We invite you to come and tour The Park Chateau.
