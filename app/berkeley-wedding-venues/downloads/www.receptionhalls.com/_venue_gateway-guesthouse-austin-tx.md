# Gateway Guesthouse Austin, Texas

Think modern luxe meets ultra relaxed at this revered bed and breakfast that sits on a thriving corner lot in the heart of Travis Heights, just minutes from downtown Austin, the hipster scene on South Congress, and the über trendy east side. Not much has changed to the exterior of this 1918 home, but the interior has been artfully reimagined, from the 12-foot-high ceilings and beautifully appointed rooms to the tasteful artwork and inviting porch that boasts curl-up cozy oversized wicker loungers. Owners Blaise and Bess, who live on the premises, have weaved together the perfect culinary experience, including welcome kits with gourmet goodies, cooking classes with tours around town and nearby organic gardens, a fabulous breakfast spread that includes everything from huevos rancheros to a ramekin-baked-potato-encrusted frittata, and a nationally acclaimed personal chef available by request. The property features a pool, spa, manicured gardens, and six different living spaces that ooze just the right mix of lush and local.
