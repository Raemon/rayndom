# Artful Arrangements Homestead Gardens Penngrove, California

Homestead Gardens has been available for affordable family gatherings in a garden setting since 2015. The heart-shaped lawn is centered among stately trees, hydrangeas and rhododendrons. Dates are still available, whereas most wineries and vineyards are completely booked.  
  
Homestead Gardens is on the grounds of a 1915 working homestead, and is the home-base for the nonprofit Artful Arrangements, whose purpose is to find ways for parents (or grand-parents) and children to play together that are affordable and fun – because that is the way children practice in public what has been taught at home about good manners, social skills, and respect for elders.  
  
Families have been pleased by the ease, convenience and affordability of having their parties here in our beautiful gardens, as well as having supported our nonprofit mission. Many have returned for events on the homestead, bringing their children and extended families with them.
