# Parkside Mansion Denver, Colorado

This gorgeous, fully-restored 1905 mansion is the perfect venue for your wedding, corporate event, gala fundraiser, or private party. From the elegant grand ballroom to the romantic rooftop patio overlooking historic City Park, Parkside Mansion is a one-of-a-kind jewel nestled in the heart of the Mile High City. All that’s missing is you!  
  
Originally known as the McPhee-McGinnity mansion, this craftsman-style Colonial Revival home was built by Denver’s original lumber barons at the turn of the 20th century. Various renovations over the years have added to the building’s size and amenities, and a complete renovation/restoration in 2015 accentuates the vintage charm while also providing just the right amount of modern luxury.  
  
Conveniently located just minutes from downtown, Parkside Mansion is close to shopping, hotels, restaurants and all sorts of popular attractions. City Park is directly across the street, and provides a breathtaking view of Denver’s skyline against the mountains.  
  
Dazzle your guests with refined elegance that can only be found at Parkside. See below for detailed information about the features and amenities that make Parkside Mansion so special… or contact us here to schedule a tour and see for yourself.
