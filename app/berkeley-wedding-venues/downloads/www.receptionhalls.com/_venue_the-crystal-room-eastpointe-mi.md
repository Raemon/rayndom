# Studio P Eastpointe, Michigan

A stones throw away from the Detroit River, The Aretha and right next to the Dequindre Cut is nestled a little slice of creative heaven. Studio P is not one thing, it's everything! 1300 square feet, 14 foot high ceilings, exposed brick and an open mezzanine in a prime location. This eclectic space can be transformed into absolutely anything you can imagine. If you can dream it, Studio P can host it! Our flexible floor plan gives you the option to set the space up in any way that fits your needs. A true gem.
