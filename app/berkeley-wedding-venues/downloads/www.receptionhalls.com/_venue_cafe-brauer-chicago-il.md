# Cafe Brauer Chicago, Illinois

Imagine gorgeous indoor and outdoor space all in one venue! Cafe? Brauer is one of Chicago’s most highly prized rental venues for good reason. This timeless Prairie School- style landmark, completed in 1908 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places, offers both earth-toned elegance and unparalleled location. Its second-floor Great Hall is the centerpiece, with its soaring, skylit roof, Tiffany-inspired glass chandeliers, stained-glass windows, tile mosaics and flanking, curved oudoor loggias providing spectacular views of the surrounding park and city skyline. A newly landscaped circular drive greets guests on Stockton Drive, but the horticultural pie?ce de re?sistance lies immediately to the east and south: Nature Boardwalk at Lincoln Park Zoo, a thriving prairie pond ecosystem teeming with native plants and wildlife.
