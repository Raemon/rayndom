# Palisadium USA Cliffside Park, New Jersey

Overlooking the New York City Skyline and the Hudson River, The Palisadium offers spectacular panoramic views to accompany any event you're planning. Our in-house catering, Carlton Catering, is sure to impress even the pickiest palate. On-site coordinators will help you with every detail, from menu to floorplan to decor.  
  
Having undergone a multi-million dollar renovation, The Palisadium now offers our Grand, Junior and River View Ballrooms. Our gem, the Skyline Ballroom, has magnificent views along the Hudson River from the George Washington bridge to the skyscrapers on the New York City horizon. By day or night, it makes a splendid backdrop for up to 600 guests.  
  
We also just added exclusive Kosher and Glatt Kosher catering to our extended list of ethnic catering. We have experience with Korean parties, Indian weddings, and family-style dinners. Call (201) 224-2211 if you have any special requests, and we'll see to it that you have a smooth and enjoyable experience!
