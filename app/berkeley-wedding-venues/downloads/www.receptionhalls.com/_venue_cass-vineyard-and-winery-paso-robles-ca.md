With a heart for hospitality and a desire to create unique experiences, the event team at CASS Winery works to polish the details while alleviating the the strains customarily associated with hosting.  
The 4,800 square foot Barrel Room with adjoining foyer and verandas can accommodate gatherings of 250+ guests. More intimate spaces for smaller gatherings or break-out sessions are located adjacent and below in the Tasting Room.  
Take your retreat even further with the CASS Camp offerings. Adventures ranging from horseback riding and archery, to agriculture classes, team building games, cooking demonstrations and wine blending sessions. Utilize the Camp offerings to break-up the intensity of training, to celebrate accomplishments, and transform time spent into valuable team solidification.   
With a full-service catering department, Executive Chef Charlie works with our guests to create memorable experiences at table. Enjoy delicious and thoughtful cuisine that comes from the heart of wine country.  
The winery has recently added to its offerings by establishing the brand new GENESEO INN, a luxury bed and breakfast catering to the robust California tradition of farm-to-table cuisine and award winning wines.
