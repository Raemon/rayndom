# Villa Lombardi's Holbrook, New York

[ Please Call ](tel:631-471-6609)

The same family that over the past two decades has created one of Long Island's most prized restaurants has now set the standards to judge reception sites. The menu is custom-designed to meet the most demanding requirements of each host and hostess. Finally there is the Lombardi Family credo,"Reputation is Everything." A family member even oversees each and every affair, as personal service is the rule.  
  
As you enter the lobby you are transported to a romantic Mediterranean Villa. Fine imported crystal chandeliers sparkle above, magnificent murals create a breathtaking backdrop. While an elegant grand staircase awaits your storybook entrance at Villa Lombardi's.
