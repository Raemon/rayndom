# Caedmon Spaces New York, New York

Located on East 80th Street between 1st and York Avenue, is the entrance to CaedmonSpaces. Walking up the quick six or seven steps shows the covered porch area of one of Pogby‘s newest venues available for bookings online. Immediately setting the tone for the decor, the covered porch can be easily draped to the planners needs. Entering the lobby of CaedmonSpaces wooden partitions can be used to cover any unwanted space while other areas of the lobby can be configured for a coat check and/or event registration. Through the double-doors of the lobby, hard wood floors run the length of the space while painted green wooden trimmings give a refined accent to the room. A classic Steinway Piano adds to the atmosphere and is available for use during events for no extra charge. Tuning is also available. Wooden or black fold up chairs are included in the rental fee when booking through Pogby.com as the Caedmon Hall can accommodate up to 75 seated guests. A beautiful stained wooden table can be removed to create more space for a seated party, and is great to be left in for formal Cocktail Reception which holds 125 people comfortably standing and mingling. Whether you are meeting the needs for 1 to 125 people, the Caedmon Hall is a beautiful space which lends itself to most any event.
