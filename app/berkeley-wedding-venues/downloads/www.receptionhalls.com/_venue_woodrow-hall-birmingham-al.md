# Woodrow Hall Birmingham, Alabama

Woodrow Hall is a magnificently restored banquet hall that is ideal for banquets, reunions, parties, fun raising events, weddings and wedding receptions. Woodrow Hall masterfully blends the new with the old.   
  
The original banquet hall and grand foyer were built in 1914. After nearly two years of restoration it now boasts of exposed brick walls, high ceilings with large wooden beams, a large dance and banquet hall and romantic lighting. This banquet hall is so picturesque that photographers are using it for engagement photos and bridal portraits!  
  
It also has a modern kitchen, sound system, plasma TV as well as an LCD projector that allow every event to have that special touch. A brick courtyard with a beautiful old water fountain welcomes your guests with old world appeal. New LED dance lights and dramatic up lights accent the brick walls adding a modern dance club feel for a memorable celebration.  
  
We can work with almost any budget. View our website at www.WoodrowHall.com . We invite you to visit this historic Birmingham landmark and talk to our event consultant!
