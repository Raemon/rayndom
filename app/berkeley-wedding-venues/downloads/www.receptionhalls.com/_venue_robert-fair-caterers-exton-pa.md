Robert Fair Caterers provides off premise catering for social events, corporate events and wedding receptions. Our professional catering service is available at your home, office or the many event facilities throughout the tri-state area.  
  
Robert Fair Caterers is named on Philadelphia Magazine's Top Ten Caterers List. Now in our 5th generation our family continues to set the standards for off premise catering and exceptional wedding receptions.  
  
Our family has catered for four of the last six Presidents of the United States. We also were selected to handle the prestigious reception for Sweden's Royalty visit to Philadelphia.  
  
We enjoy the accolades our clients so graciously send our way. Some recent excerpts from letters included these statements; "Every detail of our wedding reception was perfect, we are customers for life!" "Excellent service, wonderful cuisine, fantastic party." "The tent, lights, food and service all exceeded our expectations." We would be pleased to share these and many other letters with you.  
  
Our firm has built a strong reputation for tented receptions known as "Ballrooms Under Canvas", however we still provide off premise catering service to several unique event sites as well as providing service at customer's homes.   
  
Our Ballrooms Under Canvas have become a unique setting for the bride desiring a unique wedding reception.
