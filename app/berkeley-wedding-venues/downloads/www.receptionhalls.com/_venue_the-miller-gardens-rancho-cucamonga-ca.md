# The Miller Gardens Rancho Cucamonga, California

The Miller Gardens hosts weddings, private intimate gatherings and celebrations with DJs and live bands. Most who book a tour are amazed at how much larger our property really is in person.  
Book your tour, we can't wait to show you around!  
  
A large Bridal Suite allows for you and your bridesmaids the space to comfortably prepare for your big day with plenty of seating and natural light for those photo opportunities in a relaxed setting.  
The golden sunset glow will surely delight your photographer.  
Our English garden pathways, giant eucalyptus trees, patios, gazebo and pergola makes a wonderful scene.
