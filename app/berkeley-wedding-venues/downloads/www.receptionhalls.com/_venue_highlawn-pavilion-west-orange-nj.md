Built in 1909 on the Reservation's spectacular overlook, the Florentine - style building had been enjoyed by visitors for many years as a scenic overlook and refreshment stand. During World War I, West Orange resident Thomas Edison worked in the upstairs rooms of the pavilion on various top-secret Navy projects.  
  
After operating The Manor as a family business for more than 30 years, Harry Knowles was ready for the challenge. He and his sons, Wade and Kurt, set out to refurbish the building. In December of 1985 Harry and Wade went to northern Italy to look at countryside villas. Based on their research, Wade selected colors reminiscent of Italy's famous frescoes - muted corals and terra cottas for the walls and ceilings, and antique blue-greens for the carpeting. These colors were chosen to give a feeling of comfortable intimacy to the large, high-ceilinged rooms.  
  
Customized menu substitutions are available.  
  
All menu items are proudly prepared on the premises from only the finest and freshest ingredients available.
