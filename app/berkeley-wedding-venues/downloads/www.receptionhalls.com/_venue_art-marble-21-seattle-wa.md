# Art Marble 21 Seattle, Washington

Art Marble 21 is unique venue in the fact that it is one of the longest standing buildings in the South Lake Union area. In 1921, The Art Marble Company moved into the brand new building on Westlake Avenue North which showcased an elaborate show room on the first floor and a mezzanine floor that housed the executive offices and drafting rooms.   
  
Today the building has been updated, and we can accommodate groups from 10 – 650. We have multiple areas that can be booked, both in the showroom which has been converted into a restaurant or on the mezzanine floor for private events.   
  
Located in the beautiful South Lake Union neighborhood, Art Marble 21 has sweeping views of Lake Union with large windows of the breathtaking view. The venue has a house A/V and sound system available for use as well as full service event coordination.  
  
This is the perfect place to host an intimate gathering, private parties, corporate events, or weddings. With our unrivaled location and view, you rest assured that your guests will have an unforgettable time.
