We have met and worked with so many wonderful people over the years and would love to be be part of your special day!  
  
Our Venue is tastefully decorated with a cathedral ceiling, beautiful chandeliers and a permanent dance floor. You and your caterer will love our new fully equipped kitchen and our flexible vendor policy which allows you to choose your own caterer or pick one from our preferred list.   
  
The outdoor ceremony site includes landscaped, terraced gardens, an attractive stone pathway and gazebo. All of our brides love the gazebo and the private, setting nestled among the trees!
