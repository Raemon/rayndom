# Berwood Hill Inn Lanesboro, Minnesota

Berwood is set high and secluded in the ridges of Bluff country. Its breathtaking panoramic views of the Root River Valley offer you and your guests an exclusive wedding experience with its exquisite grounds.  
Imagine your own private, serene, pastoral retreat.  
Exchange your vows in one of our numerous garden vistas.  
From its sweeping lawns to the charming garden paths, the Inn and its grounds were designed with private, romantic, countryside weddings in mind.  
Entertain your guests, and dine amongst nature as you watch the Sunset over the valley. Dance among the moonlight and dazzling stars.  
As stated in one of many articles featuring the Inn, “Berwood Hill Inn stands out as a bright jewel in the crown of Lanesboro's scenic bluff country, with grounds for romantic weddings and intricate flower beds bursting with tangerine, fuchsia, crimson, and violet blossoms against a lush green backdrop.”
