# Historic Oakland at Town Center Columbia, Maryland

Historic Oakland’s manor offers three levels of entertaining space that can fit up to 180 with free parking and exclusive personal service. The sprawling landscape provides several options for an outdoor ceremony. On the back lawn sits an open patio that is covered with a beautiful tent from April to November – great for large receptions.  
  
Have your wedding your way. You have the freedom to hire any caterer you choose to make your event extra special. Your caterer may be your favorite restaurant, a family member, or a few of your favorite dishes from a local market. Hire a band, a DJ, or string quartet. Decorate with fresh flowers, lanterns, candles, and more.
