The rackhouse (or rickhouse) is a time-honored tradition where bourbon barrels are stored and aged. At Rack House Kitchen &amp; Tavern, we feature BBQ and smokehouse items on our extensive menu, along with local craft beers and regionally distilled whiskeys and bourbons in our lodge-style, comfortable bar and dining rooms. We offer a Private event space, Semi Private event space and Patio all of which features their own fireplace. Wood floors, mosaic tile barback, and natural wood tables bring a cozy and inviting atmosphere for you and your guests to enjoy.
