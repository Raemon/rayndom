What makes Three Cellars unique? Everything! We love fine wines and beers as much as you do, and we want to help you discover your next favorite.  
  
That’s why you’re going to love your visit here. Not only do we have have hundreds of artisanal wines and hundreds of craft beers, we also offer you amazing service to find that outstanding wine or beer. It’s a special experience for everyone from the casual drinker to the connoisseur. We are friendly, non-elitist, and here to help.  
  
Of course, we can help you find beverages to take home or give as gifts, but we also offer something else you’re going to love — we invite you to kick back, relax, and enjoy any of our wines or beers in the Cellar Lounge.  
  
Mix one part bottle shop, one part lounge, and one part wine and beer garden (in the planning stages). Stir together with excellent service from our team — and you’ve got Three Cellars!  
  
We want to share our passion with you!  
  
Owners Shawn Vollmer and Jim Nelson have a genuine passion for fine wines and beers and want to share that passion with others. This is why they opened Three Cellars in Franklin back in 2006. Shawn, Jim, and their team have come up with many innovative ways to help customers, and in the process have gained many devoted friends.  
  
In 2017, we moved the Three Cellars experience down the road to Oak Creek. This location includes the Rafter's Room, named and designed after the 1950's era landmark supper club. The Rafter's Room has a private entrance, private deck, tap beer lines, wines by the glass, sound system, and other features that make Three Cellars the most unique wine and beer destination in the area!
