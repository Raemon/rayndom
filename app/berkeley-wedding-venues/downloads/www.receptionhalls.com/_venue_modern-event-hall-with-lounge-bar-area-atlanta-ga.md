# Modern Event Hall with Lounge & Bar Area Atlanta, Georgia

Our newly renovated event lounge offers a fresh and inspiring atmosphere for collaborators, entrepreneurs, artists and community organizers to host their meetups, social events, cocktail parties and private events.   
  
Partitioned into two separate areas, hosts have the ability to accommodate a bar and refreshments on the cafe side of the building while utilizing the other side for dancing or dining. Rooms can be added on and utilized as flex spaces, for makeup/wardrobe, breakout groups, catering and refreshments and more.  
  
Outside catering and bartending is welcome in our space. All events must submit the license or certificate for their bartender at least 7 days prior to the event.
