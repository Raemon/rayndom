Our elegant yet economical banquet hall modeled after the Alexandria Room at the Metropolitan Museum of Art is the perfect place for an intimate wedding, with dining for up to 105 and cocktail for up to 225. The rental package includes two days: Friday and Saturday, to allow you a day for preparation, if you wish. A stage and baby grand piano are included as are the banquet chairs and dining tables and the china with place setting for 105. Our staff will set up the room based on your needs and take down the tables and chairs at the end of the night. There is a butler's pantry, storage room and commercial kitchen for use by your caterer. Two dressing rooms: bride and groom are available for a small additional fee.
