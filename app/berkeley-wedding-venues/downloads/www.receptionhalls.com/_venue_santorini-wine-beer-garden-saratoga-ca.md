Come taste the finest wines from local winemakers and beers from around the world and enjoy Mediterranean cuisine at Santorini Wine &amp; Beer Garden in downtown Saratoga, Ca. Enjoy the outdoors on our patio heated by firepits and let your body be infused with the sounds and rhythms of live bands. Our menu is Mediterranean and includes dishes like Chicken Souvlaki, Greek Moussaka, Lamb Shank, Falafels and much more. Beer tasting night is every Wednesday and wine tasting is every night in our cozy wine bar at the back of the patio. We boast the best wines from right here in the Santa Cruz Mountains as well as around the world, and or course from Santorini Greece. We also bring in live music on the weekends of all varieties including salsa music, Flamenco guitar, and more. We're a casual, laid back fun establishment that's great for the whole family.
