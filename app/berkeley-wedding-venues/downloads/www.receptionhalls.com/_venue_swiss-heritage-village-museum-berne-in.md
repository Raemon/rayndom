Swiss Heritage Village and Museum now offers its barn and chapel for weddings and receptions. The Sweitzer Barn is a late 19th century cantilever barn painted in traditional red and white. With wiring for catering, musical setup, and atmospheric lighting, the barn can accommodate a variety of event layouts and designs. Past weddings have used the side bays for catering and music, or as a raised dais for the ceremony. Creative lighting and draperies, as well as natural lighting from the doors on either side of the breezeway, give the barn an open, inviting atmosphere. The barn can seat roughly 140 for a reception and 200 for a wedding. Here follows a diagram of the floor plan for sketching out ideas for the setup of your event. Additionally, our Baumgartner Church, built in 1860, offers a cozier venue for your wedding, whereafter you can head over to our barn for the reception! Our current pricing for weddings and/or receptions is $1500 for the barn, $300 for weddings in the church ($400 with additional heating), or $1800 if you choose to have your wedding in the church and reception in the barn thereafter. Additionally, you may rent the open grounds themselves for your wedding for $200. This fee includes access to the grounds for one day before the event for setup and rehearsal, as well as one day afterward for teardown. Exact timing will be negotiated in your contract. If you desire tents to be set up outdoors, they are available for an additional fee. On the day of the event, we offer a staging area and restrooms below the barn, and if you need more space you're welcome to use our museum building. As shown in our photographs, we offer basic dimmable lighting and decorations on site. There are 15 electrical outlets, allowing for creative layout and planning of lighting. Tables and chairs, included in the price, are available for wedding and reception layouts based on our floor plan. We offer golf cart rental ($50) to move people and supplies around the grounds.
