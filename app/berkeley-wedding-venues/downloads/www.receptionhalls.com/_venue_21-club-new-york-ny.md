# 21 Club New York, New York

You're about to enter a world where legends (past and present) gather to enjoy life. An enchanting Manhattan landmark where celebrities and the yet-to-be-famous converge to delight their senses amid one of the world's most dynamic eateries. Steeped in a history based on serving only the finest American food and drink, somehow '21' consistently evolves, able to maintain its enviable position as a dining icon and haven for society's movers and shakers.  
  
From Salvador Dali to Humphrey Bogart and every president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt (with the lone exception of George W. Bush), a visit to '21' is a rite of passage. After the 1933 repeal of Prohibition, the scene was set for '21's founders Jack Kriendler and Charlie Berns to build the speakeasy's reputation among the rich and fashionable, thereby creating Gotham's most sought-after restaurant. Since then, '21' has catered to both public figures and those seeking the ultimate in privacy. Opulent yet comfortable, '21's atmosphere is warm and inviting, accessible to all.  
  
'21's impeccable reputation for unparalleled service and cuisine make it a favorite setting for dinners, celebrations, receptions, meetings, and other business events. With ten elegantly appointed private dining rooms of various size and style, '21' can accommodate events large and small from an intimate dinner for ten to a lavish reception for 400.
