# Kolossal Dreams Atlanta, Georgia

Kolossal Dreams is beautifully designed and conveniently located. We are 5 minutes from downtown Atlanta. Which means we are close to the city but not right in the hustle and bustle of Atlanta traffic. We have our own parking lot therefore parking is absolutely free. Our gorgeous event space is sophisticated and chic. The atmosphere is elegant but uniquely designed because of our high loft style ceilings. We have a fully equipped prep kitchen,tables, clear acrylic chairs, beverage bar and free parking. All of these features are included with your rental.  
Give us a call directly at 470-735-KDEB (5332) for a faster response and check out our Instagram and website for me pictures & videos.
