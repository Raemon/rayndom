Broad sweeping lawns and gardens, a glittering pond with dancing fountain and the architecture of 18th century Maine, the stage is set for you and your guests and an unforgettable moment in time. Be it outdoors next to that glorious landscaped pond or inside one of the most spectacularly restored 18th century barns in the Midcoast with every luxury of the 21st century. Because we know weddings and how important the little touches are, we invite you to take a peek at our bridal suite where you can prepare for your celebration, rest a bit and gaze out as our experienced and creative staff see to the finishing touches.
