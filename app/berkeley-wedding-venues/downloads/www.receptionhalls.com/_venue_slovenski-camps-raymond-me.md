# Slovenski Camps Raymond, Maine

Camp is the perfect place for a casual and fun wedding. The natural beauty mixed with the activity options will make an unforgettable weekend. Overnight accommodations take the headache out of planning shuttles and hotel blocks, and make it more enjoyable and safer for guests to walk to their cabins at the end of the night or between activities.
