# Lakeside at Carolina Marina Stokesdale, North Carolina

This beautiful location on Belews Lake is the perfect place for a small, intimate reception or an event up to 150. Lakeside special event center can be configured for your group, large or small; inside or out. Located on a hill overlooking the Marina's South Cove, photographs become instant memories. And if that's not close enough to the water, ask us about our pontoon boat rentals. If you need a little space of your own before or after your event, the three-bedroom Brick House and two-bedroom Cottage are just steps away.
