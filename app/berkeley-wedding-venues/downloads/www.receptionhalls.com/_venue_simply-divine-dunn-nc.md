# Simply Divine Dunn, North Carolina

I would love to personally invite you to experience Simply Divine — a historic 8BD/10BA estate in the heart of Dunn, NC. Built between 1906–1909 by Hannibal Godwin, former Mayor, State Senator, and U.S. Congressman, this property is truly one-of-a-kind.  
  
From its grand foyer, soaring ceilings, and rare original pocket doors to its resort-style pool, 2BD guest house, and lush grounds, every detail is filled with charm and opportunity. Whether as a forever home, bed & breakfast, or wedding venue, this estate offers endless potential.  
  
From a business standpoint, this is the perfect opportunity to generate immediate income as a Wedding/Event Venue, Airbnb, or Bed & Breakfast. And the best part? It comes fully furnished, so you can begin operating from day one!  
  
I’d love to schedule a private viewing so you can see this masterpiece for yourself. When would be a good time for you?
