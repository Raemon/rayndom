# Outing Lodge Stillwater, Minnesota

GIVE YOUR WEDDING A HOME!  
  
A European style country estate in a wooded 350 acre park minutes away from historic Stillwater MN, The Outing Lodge is a magical venue for a romantic wedding. When you and your guest "move into" the Outing Lodge, everything can happen at one location. Our gardens and lawns welcome casual strolling, relaxed picture taking, elegant ceremony, and a carefree receiving line. Sip champagne on the patio and then move indoors for a wedding feast that your family and friends will be talking about for years to come. Move to the English Pub for a night of dancing, and at the end simply walk upstairs to your bedroom for a peaceful night's sleep. The next morning you can linger over breakfast with your guest, and begin the reminiscing with your family and friends...
