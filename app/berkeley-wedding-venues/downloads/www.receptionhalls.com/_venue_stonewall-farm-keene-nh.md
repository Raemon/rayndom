# Stonewall Farm Keene, New Hampshire

A Place to Gather. A Place to Grow.   
  
Stonewall Farm offers customized event and wedding experiences on our 120 acre regenerative farm and dairy.   
  
Stonewall Farm offers you a truly unique rustic setting in our one of a kind reception hall. The beautiful post and beam building features a 30ft tall field stone fireplace and authentic grain silo that has been transformed to a wooden spiral staircase. Our stone patio surrounded by blossoming flowers and twinkling lights is the perfect place to host your cocktail hour. Three ceremony sites are available amidst our 120 acres of property. Your choice of either the knoll, the garden, or our carriage barn will highlight this quaint New England farm's natural beauty. Most importantly your special day with us helps support a wonderful cause. Stonewall Farm is a nonprofit educational farm who's mission is to connect people to the land and to the role of agriculture in their lives. Come visit and see why Stonewall Farm is considered such a valuable resource to the region and the perfect place for you to begin a lifetime of wonderful memories. Wedding and Private Event tours may be scheduled by appointment with our Event Coordinator. Call today to ask about our rates and availability. Discounted rates are available for off season weddings. Entertain your guests with hayrides, sleigh rides, and Cinderella Carriage rides.

Stonewall Farm is open to the public daily from 9am - 5pm.
