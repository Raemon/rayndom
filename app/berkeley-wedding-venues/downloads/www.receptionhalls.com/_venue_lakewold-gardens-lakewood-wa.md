# Lakewold Gardens Lakewood, Washington

Lakewold is a premier garden estate created with formal and natural settings. The gardens and Georgian style mansion are available for you to use exclusively on the day of your event. Our estate features a beautiful setting for a ceremony and reception that includes the historic Wagner House, a brick walk, stunning gazebo, a quatrefoil pool, natural pathways with ponds, spiral staircase and a Wisteria covered terrace. Our venue offers endless photo opportunities that you and your guests will share long after your wedding. The Wagner House also offers a variety of meeting room space that can be utilized in many ways – from a small staff retreat in our upstairs boardroom overlooking the gardens, to an evening reception under our wisteria draped veranda – an event held at Lakewold is unlike any other.
