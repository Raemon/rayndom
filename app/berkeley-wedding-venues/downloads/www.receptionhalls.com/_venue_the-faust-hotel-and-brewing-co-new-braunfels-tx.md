# The Faust Hotel and Brewing Co. New Braunfels, Texas

Here at The Faust, we offer something off the beaten path, a venue with a lot of character. Very often, “unique” and “cost-effective” are a hard-to-come-by combination, but you don’t have to have Kardashian-like funding for this shindig.  
  
Our ballroom staff is well-trained in the art of designing and executing successful events. You and your guests will be served food prepared by our chef and pampered by our professional service staff. Our catering menus are designed to for a range of styles, tastes, and budgets. From traditional pub favorites to more sophisticated cuisine, the menus are sure to satisfy even the pickiest palate. Beer lovers rejoice! Add a twist to the event by serving one of our very own Faust Beers. The ballroom offers a private bar dedicated exclusively to the needs of your guests. You can choose from our variety of bar options like an open bar, cash bar, controlled tab, tickets, etc.  
  
A hotel, event venue, brew pub, full bar and restaurant, you will need to go no further than your very own hotel to experience New Braunfels best. The Faust is within walking distance to Schlitterbahn Water Park and the Comal River and is centrally located between San Antonio and Austin. It is located in downtown New Braunfels next to specialty stores, antique shops and boutiques, and only minutes away from Gruene, TX.   
  
I would love to have you come by and tour our ballroom as well as discuss what you have in mind for your event. I look forward to hearing from you soon.  
  
An all-in-one destination...  
You don't have to go home,  
Everyone can stay here.
