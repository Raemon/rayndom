# Camp Esquagama Minneapolis, Minnesota

Thank you for clicking on Camp Esquagama today. We offer a beautifully restored historic main lodge. It was constructed in 1935 with red pine logs from northern MN.  
  
At Camp Esquagama we believe one week can change a child’s world. Kids who come to camp create lasting friendships, build self-confidence, develop lifelong skills, and most importantly have fun just being a kid!  
  
As we have slowly opened our facilities to other groups outside of our summer season, we stand true to our mission of giving kids time to be kids. We are open about prioritizing groups who work with youth, Camp Esquagama does not accept all event types or groups as we believe they do not meet our mission.  
  
A quick list of events Camp Esquagama have approved include youth based organization day and weekend retreats, business board meetings and single day conferences, as well as art and yoga day usage.  
  
A quick list of events that Camp Esquagama does not accept or no longer accepts include weddings, reunions, and parties.  
  
Important: Camp Esquagama is an alcohol and rug free camp ground. Absolute zero tolerance, guests will be asked to leave immediately with a designated driver if they have consumed.
