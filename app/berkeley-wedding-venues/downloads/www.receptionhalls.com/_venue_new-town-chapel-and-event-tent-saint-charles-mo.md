# New Town Chapel and Event Tent Saint Charles, Missouri

New Town Event Planning was established in April of 2006 to meet the growing demand of residents and visitors alike who wished to hold a special event at The New Town at St. Charles. But perhaps we should first briefly explain the concept of this unique development.   
  
New Town is a traditional neighborhood development designed by Duany Plater-Zyberk &amp; Co. (DPZ), the nations – perhaps the worlds – finest town planners. New Town is a true town with a wide range of housing types woven into a community with neighborhood stores, wide-open green spaces and an intricate system of lakes and canals. When completed, New Town will have approximately 5,700 units, four planned neighborhood centers and a proposed large town center.   
  
New Town simply goes back in time. Perhaps you’ve lived or visited old towns where fresh bread was within walking distance at the corner bakery … where the coffee shop was a bike ride away or where people walked to the neighborhood church. The New Town at St. Charles encourages walking and biking first – cars second. The community provides an urban atmosphere yet has small town charm. It gives people a choice in how to live.
