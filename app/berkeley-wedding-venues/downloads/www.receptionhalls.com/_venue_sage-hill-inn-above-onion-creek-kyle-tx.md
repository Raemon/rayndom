Considered a hidden gem in the Texas hill country, Sage Hill Inn sits on nearly 90 acres of lush hills outside the Capital City. Offering miles of hiking, biking and birding trails to explore, guests also enjoy the “overlook” which sits atop a cliffside eighty feet above Onion Creek, providing endless stunning views. Providing a three-course dinner and a hot breakfast with every stay, the restaurant at the Inn sources many ingredients from their own garden and nearby farms. Currently the bed and breakfast is expanding to feature 15 guest suites, a 5,000-square-foot multi-tiered deck surrounding a pool and hot tub, a greenhouse for homegrown vegetables and herbs, and an outdoor fire pit for gatherings after dinner. The refurbished rooms with natural wood beams and rich fabrics will feature 50MBPS internet connections, flat-screen TVs, and smart phone docks. The spa at the Inn will also offered extended services and additional rooms.
