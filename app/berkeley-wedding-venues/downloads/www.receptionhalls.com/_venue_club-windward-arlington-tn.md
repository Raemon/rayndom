# Club Windward Arlington, Tennessee

"Tablescapes"---the word does not appear in most dictionaries, but that is because the editors have not experienced the food and breathtaking presentations created by Pat and Georgia Smith. Pat and Georgia, owners of Club Windward on Canada Road in Lakeland, TN have combined their talents and created an amazing ambiance at Club Windward.  
  
Georgia and her staff create unique menus containing incredible homemade specialties and individualized presentations including candles, flowers, and tiered displays. Events may be held at Club Windward, at a client's own home, or at a chosen party site.  
  
If you have a celebration of any type and you want it to be unforgettable, have Georgia design a menu and décor to meet your needs. From cosmopolitan to shabby chic, and everything in between, Club Windward's staff will make your event magical.
