Founded by the same team that runs the historic Adelman Event Center, we are excited to introduce Boise's newest wedding venue, The Water's Edge. Located just a short drive from downtown Boise in Eagle, Idaho - The Water's Edge is located near the scenic waters of the Boise River.  
  
Our venue provides indoor and outdoor availability, separate bridal and groom suites, on-site parking, and in-house catering. Our best characterization, however, is the subtle yet striking fusion of contemporary chic and vintage elegance design.   
  
The outdoor veranda features the simple elegance of a beautiful waterfront view and can accommodate small to medium sized weddings, creating a private space that is ideal for intimate wedding ceremonies. Our indoor Grand Ball Room can accommodate up to 350 individuals comfortably and is fully equipped to handle any need.
