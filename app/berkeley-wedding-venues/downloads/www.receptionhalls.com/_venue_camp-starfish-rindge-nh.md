# Camp Starfish Rindge, New Hampshire

Camp Starfish resides on 43+ acres of quintessential New Hampshire woodlands with stunning views across Lake Monomonac.  
  
The Starfish facilities include a central wooden lodge for entertaining 160+ people, overnight cabin accommodation, a stone and wood beam chapel overlooking the lake, a large playing field with GaGa pit, sand volleyball court, and playground, three private beaches for kayaking, canoeing, and swimming, bountiful indoor and outdoor meeting and event spaces, foodservice, campfires with s’mores, and so much more.  
  
Our year-round Crescent Lodge Retreat Centre is also available for bookings. Crescent Lodge has a modern and cozy feel, but retains the beautiful NH woodlands backdrop Camp Starfish offers.   
  
As you can imagine, Starfish is the perfect venue for weddings, retreats, celebrations, private camps, and other special events.  
  
As a non-profit, 100% of the proceeds from your rental serves our missions work: providing highly structured, individualized, nurturing, safe, and fun summer and year-round programs to children with emotional, behavioral, social and learning challenges.  
  
We're just over an hour from Boston, and easily accessible from anywhere in New England. Starfish is far enough away to provide a feeling of separation from the daily grind, but close enough to be easily accessible for day or weekend trips. And, while our camp is rustic and located on a quiet inlet of the lake, we're also less than 10 minutes from basic conveniences.
