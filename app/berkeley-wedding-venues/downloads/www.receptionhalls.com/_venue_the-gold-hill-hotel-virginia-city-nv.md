# The Gold Hill Hotel Virginia City, Nevada

Rooming house, private residence, bar, brothel, periods of non-use- for 152 years, this solid structure has steadfastly survived against all odds. Once again a thriving full-service rooming, dining and drinking establishment, the Gold Hill Hotel is the oldest hotel in the state of Nevada.
