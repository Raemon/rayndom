Snowvillage Inn has been welcoming guests to the White Mountains since 1958. Located in the village of Snowville in the quaint town of Eaton, New Hampshire, we offer the classic charm of a country inn with modern amenities. The Snowvillage Inn owned by Innkeepers Kevin Flynn and his partner Jennifer Kovach, who have made many renovations to bring this iconic inn back to its original splendor, today the property features pristine, award-winning gardens, sprawling lawns with breathtaking views of the Presidential Range, a casual fine dining room and lounge and 17 guest rooms, providing overnight accommodations for up to 38 guests.   
  
In addition to the Main Inn, the property offers a myriad of other settings for your ceremony, reception, and photos. The adjacent lawn can accommodate a 40 by 60 foot tent for larger weddings, and the beautiful front lawn is often the site for outdoor ceremonies, offering spectacular mountain views. Overnight accommodations at the inn’s 3 buildings offer first class amenities, all with private bathrooms and complimentary, full country breakfast each morning.   
  
Guests at Snowvillage Inn relish the picturesque views of Mt. Washington and the Presidential Range most often enjoyed in our casual fine dining room or with drinks on our screened in porch and fireplace lounge. Nestled in the heart of Mt. Washington Valley, many guests enjoy the countless outdoor recreational activities, including access to the private beach on the serene Crystal Lake. If you'd like, we'd be more than happy to recommend area activities for your wedding party and guests.  
  
Please give us a call with any additional questions you may have. We would love to learn more about your wedding plans and arrange a time for you to visit Snowvillage Inn to see for yourself its unrivalled charm and suitability as your wedding venue.
