# Northwest Arena - Atrium Boardroom and Rooftop Patio Jamestown, New York

This space is inspiring! It is sleek, modern, urban, and truly one-of-a-kind. The atrium features floor-to-ceiling south and eastern-facing windows. A rooftop patio can accommodate up to 20 guests at one time.  
  
This space can be rented for most occasions including, birthday parties, cocktail receptions, bridal party photos, fundraising events, corporate meetings, showers, retirement parties, and more.  
  
A divider allows the space to be multifunctional for corporate events, giving renters the ability to create break-out rooms. A 70” smart tv can display presentations of all sorts, and the kitchenette makes coffee bars or luncheons convenient to host in-room.  
  
Walking fully into the space rewards guests with a panoramic view of downtown Jamestown; from the Chadakoin River, down 2nd street, over toward the medical community, and back up toward the higher numbered streets. The unique curvature of the floor-to-ceiling windows gives the sensation of being suspended over 2nd street.
