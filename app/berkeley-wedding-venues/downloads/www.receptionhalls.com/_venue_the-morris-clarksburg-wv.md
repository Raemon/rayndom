# The Morris Clarksburg, West Virginia

The Morris in Clarksburg, West Virginia, is an utterly unique vintage industrial chic setting that can make your event truly historic. As one of the largest indoor event spaces in North Central West Virginia, we can host weddings, parties, and meetings for up to 350 guests in climate-controlled comfort. From the reception area on the first floor, complete with a private bride’s room, to the expansive 10,000 square feet of open event space on the third floor, The Morris offers you a space that can fulfill your dreams. Our bespoke experience includes professional planning services, a unique catalogue of vintage furnishings, on-site amenities, free parking, and white-glove customer service to ensure you will have a historic, trouble-free event.   
  
From the moment your guests arrive, they’ll know they’re in for a special night. Enter through our renovated first floor reception area adorned with local area vintage and industrial details. Here you will find guest restrooms and a bridal room with its own restroom and vanity area.  
  
Then take the restored 1955 Otis freight elevator for a dramatic entry to the third floor. Your guests will truly be “wowed” when they step off the elevator into your event. The original hemlock beams, exposed brick, and maple hardwood floors define an event space like no other in West Virginia.
