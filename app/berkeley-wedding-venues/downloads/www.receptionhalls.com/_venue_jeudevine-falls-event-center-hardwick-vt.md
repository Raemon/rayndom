# Jeudevine Falls Event Center Hardwick, Vermont

Many people have said that Jeudevine Falls is the most beatiful venue for any special occasion in Vermont. Once in a while, in the middle of an ordinary life, love gives us a fairy tale. With 3 waterfalls, amphitheater, wedding/event tent, 2 barns, small covered bridge, and a parking area for 100 cars, Jeudevine Falls gives up just that. Beautiful at any time of day, absolutely magical when lighted at night, the soothing sounds of the falls and the beauty and tranquility of the meticulously maintained grounds provide a lovely backdrop for the many weddings and proms held here.
