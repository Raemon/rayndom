# Ralph & Kacoo's Bossier City, Louisiana

Greetings,   
  
Ralph and Kacoos has definitely shined its light over the past 30 years  
and we are still moving forward looking for new and innovative  
opportunities to continue to promote a Taste of Louisiana to our hometown folks but more importantly to our incoming groups, travelers, conferences  
and more!*  
  
Even though most will foresee us only as a restaurant, let's not forget  
about the nice, intimate yet spacious rooms that we have available to host groups as small as 20 up to groups as large as 125.*  
  
Ralph and Kacoos aims to please! With a cozy room setting to tasteful  
Louisiana cuisine, we are definitely a best kept secret. We are working  
diligently to create unique ideas for our event space starting with  
business meetings to community service group dinners, social groups,  
personal events such as birthday parties, anniversaries and now weddings!  
  
One of the other great things about Ralph and Kacoos is that we can provide that Louisiana feel for visitors coming to our city starting with the fun and inviting zydeco music, tantalizing food options and plus great keepsakes themed around Louisiana!   
  
I hope to hear from you soon and see how we can begin working and networking together! I thank you for your time in advance.  
  
Thanks,  
  
Candace Bradford  
Catering &amp; Events Manager
