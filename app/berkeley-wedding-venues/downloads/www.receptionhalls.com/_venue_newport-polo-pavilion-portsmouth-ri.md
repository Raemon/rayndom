# Newport Polo Club Portsmouth, Rhode Island

Bring your next special event to life in the scenic Newport Polo Club grounds at historic Glen Farm. Your guests will be greeted by an enchanting entrance drive allee under a canopy of ancient lindens on Linden Lane, before arriving at the International Polo Field, with sweeping vistas of the beautifully manicured grounds, classic white fenced pastures, elegantly restored stone barns, and miles of field-stone walls.  
  
Our private tented clubhouse Pavilion is available for seasonal rentals, offering an exciting destination for those seeking a unique setting for any occasion. The Pavilion is a versatile multi-level structure that can be transformed to suit events of up to 500, including tented seating for 100 (additional tenting available). Enjoy flexible arrangements, customizable decor to fit your style, and one-of-a-kind polo entertainment options. Available seasonally, May - October.  
  
Other services include Polo Parties, great for rehearsal dinners, engagement parties, bachelor/bachelorette parties, and social gatherings. Entertain your guests during one of the acclaimed matches in the Newport International Polo Series. Spectators are treated to a 2-hour exhibition match as the home-team, USA/Newport, takes on weekly challengers from home and abroad in one of New England's most popular outdoor summer events. Options include reserved field-side tailgate spaces, or private parties in the Pavilion - our centerfield club-house entertainment marquee. Available Saturdays, June - September.
