# Fitz Place (Boutique Inn, Barn and Vineyard) San Martin, California

When you choose Fitz Place for your wedding weekend, you’ll never feel rushed. Check in on Friday, and welcome your closest friends and family to your first celebration that evening… the rehearsal dinner in the Vineyard Meadow under a starry sky. On Saturday, exchange vows beneath the majestic oak trees on the front lawn, then follow up with your reception and first dance as husband and wife in the Mews Barn. And why not top off the festivities with a mimosa filled breakfast on Sunday morning on our spacious back deck before you check out? At Fitz Place, you get all this for the same price many venues charge for just 5 or 6 hours.
