# Oak Forest Events Venue Broaddus, Texas

Oak Forest is a modern, industrial space that has a clean slate vibe. The white interior walls and high ceilings are the perfect backdrop; from minimalist to a full range of color schemes and themes. Located between Lake Sam Rayburn and the Angelina National Forest offering a secluded hillside setting. There is a comfortable balance of woodsy space and natural grassy areas along with a beautiful deep pond and pier. Pamper yourself in our gorgeous Bridal Suite and spacious Groom's Dressing Room.
