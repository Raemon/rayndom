# Superstition Manor Wedding & Event Center Mesa, Arizona

Superstition Manor is the valley’s premier wedding and event center located in Mesa, Arizona with iconic views of Superstition Mountain. We have three different reception halls which all feature private ceremony yards, large getting ready suites, and covered patios all spread out over an 11 acre estate. We specialize in both weddings and special events including birthday parties, corporate events, celebrations of life and school functions.  
  
Hands down, our most distinguished feature is that every wedding and event has their own venue planner to help walk you through every step of your important day from design needs to day of coordinator! All inclusive is at the center of our packages. We are not just a venue, we are your event team! From your venue planner to your event staff, no one makes it look easier than we do.
