Homestead Manor was built by Mr. &amp; Mrs. Francis Giddens, who obtained the property through a Revolutionary War Grant. After moving to Tennessee from Virginia, the Giddens, using bricks and woods made on site built the home. It was completed in 1819.  
On March 5, 1863, the Civil War Battle of Thompson’s Station took place on the property as Confederate troops led by General Nathan Bedford Forrest clashed with Federalist forces. There were 1,400 causalities on the Federalist side and 400 on the Confederate side. During the battle, 17-year-old Alice Thompson and other women from the community watched from the Homestead Manor cellar window as the Confederate flag bearer was shot down. Young Alice Thompson bolted from the cellar, took up the flag and rallied the Rebel troops.  
Today, Homestead Manor is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The 50-acre property has a conservation easement through The Land Trust of Tennessee and will be the centerpiece of a planned Thompson’s Station Battlefield Park.
