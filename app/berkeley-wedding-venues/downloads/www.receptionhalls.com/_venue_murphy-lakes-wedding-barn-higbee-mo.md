# MURPHY LAKES WEDDING BARN Higbee, Missouri

We at Murphy Lakes, feel that a wedding should be the happiest day of a bride and grooms life. This is their last party as single people and their first party as a married couple. Weddings should be safe, beautiful, reasonably priced, magical, and fun as hell. A destination wedding at Murphy Lakes accomplishes all of that, and more.
