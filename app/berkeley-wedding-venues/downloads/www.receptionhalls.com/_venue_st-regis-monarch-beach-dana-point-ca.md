# St. Regis Monarch Beach Dana Point, California

To celebrate one of the most important days of your life, there is no place more romantic than the Southern California coast.  
  
Whether you desire to exchange your most sacred vows in an intimate outdoor ceremony or plan to host 800 of your closest friends in one of our grand ballrooms, we offer captivating oceanfront wedding venues for every occasion.  
  
Our signature ceremony setting, the Grand Lawn, overlooks our ocean pool and presents stunning views of the glittering Pacific Ocean. The 12,000-square-foot Pacific Ballroom enchants with its coffered ceilings, bronze chandeliers, and frescoed pastoral scenes. For a more intimate setting, Club 19 seamlessly blends a breezy outdoor terrace wrapped in fuchsia bougainvillea with views of the ocean and Monarch Beach Golf Links, with a welcoming indoor area warmed by a fireplace.
