# Union Hall Mount Pleasant, Iowa

Built in 1861, the Union Block is a magnificent structure overlooking Central Park. Over the past 150 years, the Union Block has had a rich history. One of the most notable events occurred in 1869. It was here, at the Union Block, that Arabella Mansfield took her oath to become the first female licensed to practice law in the United States. Other noteworthy individuals that have spoken in the Union Block include: Frederick Douglass, Bronson Alcott, and Anna Dickinson.  
  
Recently finishing a $3.4 million restoration, the building is now open for public use. The ground floor is comprised of 2 retail suites, while the 2nd floor houses 4 office suites, and the 3rd floor houses the reception hall, or Union Hall.   
  
Union Hall is a grand reception room that features 5 glorious chandeliers, original picture windows overlooking the Mount Pleasant Square, built-in kitchen, and a second "overflow" room for out-of-sight food service. With the different size spaces available, the 3rd floor is perfect for weddings, corporate events and meetings, and private affairs.  
  
Although built in 1861, the building is completely handicap accessible with elevator access to all 3 floors and large door/restrooms openings for wheelchair accessibility.  
  
Union Hall does not offer on-site catering, but outside caterers and event planners are always welcome! As part of the Mount Pleasant Chamber Alliance, Main Street Mount Pleasant will recommend a preferred caterer and also allow all types of insured outside caters to serve food/beverages and use its kitchen and rentals.  
  
If you are interested in renting the Union Hall, or would like more information about the Union Hall, please contact Main Street Mount Pleasant.
