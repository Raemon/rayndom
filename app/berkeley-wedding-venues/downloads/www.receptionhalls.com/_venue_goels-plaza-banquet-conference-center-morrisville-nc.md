# Goels Plaza Banquet & Conference Center Morrisville, North Carolina

Since its opening in 2004 Goels Plaza has hosted a multitude of events. With over 15,000 square feet of ballroom space we can hold the largest of gatherings. But since the space is divided amongst 5 ballrooms, we can cater to smaller groups just as easily.  
  
Recently remodeled in 2015, Goels Plaza has a fresh look and the latest upgrades. We created an improved office space to serve our customers better and added more ballroom space. In 2016 we added a new awning to the front and side entrances that give the outside an elegant look.  
  
Goels Plaza continues to evolve and grow to meet the needs of people in the Triangle and other areas of North Carolina. Our staff is waiting to help make your event the best.
