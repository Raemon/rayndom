# Scappoose Creek Inn Scappoose, Oregon

The restored historic dairy barn was built in 1920 and now houses a finished reception hall which can be used for your next event. The “barn” can be decorated to suit your event whether it be a wedding ceremony, reception, reunion or company party. Contact Scappoose Creek Inn today to learn more, or to schedule your event. When you rent the hall, you also have access to the surrounding grounds if you want your ceremony outside by the pond area or at the gazebo.
