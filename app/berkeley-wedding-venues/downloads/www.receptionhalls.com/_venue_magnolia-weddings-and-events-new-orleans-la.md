New Orleans Wedding Venue  
Congratulations on your upcoming wedding! Thank you for considering Magnolia Weddings and Events when comparing New Orleans wedding venues. Our dedicated management and staff promise to make your special event both memorable and successful. Our 15,000-square foot facility, located in the heart of Elmwood, is the perfect location for your New Orleans wedding venue and reception.  
  
Magnolia Weddings and Events is widely recognized as one of the premier event halls in New Orleans. We can comfortably accommodate 100-600 guests, including seating for up to 300 with abundant free parking.  
  
Depending on your specific wedding needs, we are also able to offer the unique option of two separate rooms for your wedding ceremony and reception. A unique benefit that is not common with other wedding venues in New Orleans.  
  
Most importantly, this presents your guests with the opportunity to enjoy the elegant setting for your wedding and ceremony while minimizing expenses, travel time and maximizing fun. They can then enter the spectacular reception where they will be greeted with a glass of champagne upon entry.  
  
The 1,200-square foot dance floor and experienced DJ will have your guests dancing the night away. The understated yet elegant interior décor provides a romantic setting for this once-in-a-lifetime affair.  
  
Your professional bridal coordinator will assist you with your every need so that you can concentrate on having the time of your life!
