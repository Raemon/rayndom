# Le Parker Meridien New York, New York

While others speak of their ability to accommodate an event, Le Parker Meridien prefers to think in terms of hosting an occasion. Four conference rooms directly above our atrium lobby offer flexible arrangements for anything from small meetings to receptions for as many as 500. And high above, on the 42nd floor is the exquisite, glass-enclosed penthouse providing a dramatic view of Central Park and the Manhattan skyline-the ideal setting for an exceptional event.  
  
On your special day, you want everything to be perfect -- from getting in shape before your wedding, to the reception hall, to the food and to that memorable toast. Don't worry about a thing, because Le Parker Meridien will see to it that all your needs are met. For a wedding reception of up to 170 people, the Tansa or the Azekka, on the third floor, are perfect venues with a backdrop of the Atrium Lobby.  
  
Following the reception, we move you and your party to the Estrala on the 42nd floor, where an inspiring view of Central Park and the Midtown Manhattan skyline complements lunch or dinner and a toast to the bride and groom.
