# Farmers and Merchants Bank Los Angeles, California

[ Please Call ](tel:213-253-4777)

The Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank is a beautiful historic building in downtown LA that is perfectly suited for a range of events.   
  
Designed in the Classical Revival style, the Farmers and Merchants National Bank remains one of Southern California's finest examples of the early "temples of finance", which were popular at the turn of the century. Its two-story façade, reminiscent of a Roman temple, is punctuated by an entrance framed with Corinthian columns topped by a large triangular pediment.   
  
Much of the original banking room remains, including light fixtures, a central skylight, and the loggia with its Victorian-style railings. This building now functions primarily as a special events and banquet facility and film location.
