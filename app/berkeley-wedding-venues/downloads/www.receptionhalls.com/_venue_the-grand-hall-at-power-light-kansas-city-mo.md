# The Grand Hall at Power & Light Kansas City, Missouri

The Grand Hall at Power &amp; Light provides a beautiful space for wedding receptions, corporate and non-profit events. From custom banquet chairs to original art deco lanterns, The Grand Hall has been artfully chosen and carefully restored to exude classic glamour.  
While the space can accommodate up to 500 guests, it allows creativity within the layouts to give a 150 person event a unique and intimate feel. When you reserve The Grand Hall, you’ll have access to our beautifully furnished Bridal &amp; Groom’s Suites and plush seating areas on the Mezzanine.
