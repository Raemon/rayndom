# Just the Place LLC Ozawkie, Kansas

Just the Place gives you a beautiful pavilion as a ceremony backdrop, a big old barn that looks the same inside as it did a hundred years ago, and a cute little bridal cottage to stay overnight.   
We know that you want to keep control of the biggest event of your life. We also know that the most valuable thing we can give you is time. Time to relax with family and friends, decorate the facility with your colors and keepsakes, and enjoy being with your guests on your wedding day. This is why we only schedule one event per weekend. We want to be completely focused on your needs, and do everything we can to make your experience the best it can be.   
You decide when and how to decorate the wedding pavilion and reception barn. You decide who, whether vendors, friends or family, to provide for music, photography, food, and fun. You never worry about the time because you have tomorrow to gather your things instead of that night. Please see our website for pictures!
