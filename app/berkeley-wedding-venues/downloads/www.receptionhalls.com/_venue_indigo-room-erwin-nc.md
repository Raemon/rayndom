Built in 1925, the building that now houses The Indigo Room, originally served as a mercantile store for locals. Located directly across from the railroad and just a block from the denim mill, the building also served as a post office. Over the years, many businesses have come and gone, changing both the exterior and interior, taking away from its original architecture.  
  
In an effort to stay true to the building's heritage, the room was stripped down to reveal the exposed brick of the former outside wall.  
  
Also staying true to heritage, the building was named The Indigo Room referencing the color blue that is used when making denim.
