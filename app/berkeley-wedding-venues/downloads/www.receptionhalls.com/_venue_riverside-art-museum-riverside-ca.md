# Riverside Art Museum Riverside, California

Julia Morgan believed that architecture was a visual art. Having designed over 700 buildings, most notably Hearst Castle in San Simeon during her 46-year career as one of California’s premier architects, she proved herself to be a true artist.  
  
In the midst of our beautiful City of Riverside, we have a Morgan-designed landmark treasure. Built in 1929 in a unique mixture of Mediterranean and Classical revival styles, the Riverside YWCA on the corner of Lime and Mission Inn incorporated practicality, convenience, and elegant simplicity in an innovative tri-block design, constructed with reinforced, poured-in-place concrete. This design is unique among the 17 YWCA's Morgan designed. The movement and interest created by the tri-block design works not only on the exterior of the building, but also on the two interior floors. Morgan's building successfully functioned as Riverside's YWCA for nearly 40 years.  
  
The building’s distinctive architecture as a work of art in its own right brought it to the attention of the Riverside Art Center in the 1960s. Purchased from the YWCA on July 5, 1967, Morgan’s building became the proud home of the Riverside Art Museum.  
  
Although the original function of Julia Morgan's building has changed, the spirit of its precedent-setting architect will be forever preserved in the timeless quality and beautiful design of the building. Morgan's architecture truly stands as a testimony to her fortitude, her skill, and her brilliantly enduring sensibilities.  
  
...and if you’re looking for the perfect place for an elegant affair for your special day, look no further than the historic and unique building that is now the Riverside Art Museum. Exchange vows in Julia’s garden-like atrium. Let your friends and family toast to your joy and good health in one of our art galleries, and dance the night away in the arms of the one you love under the stars on our rooftop courtyard.
