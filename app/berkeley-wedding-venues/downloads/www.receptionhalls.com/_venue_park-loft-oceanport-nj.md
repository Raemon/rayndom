# Park Loft Oceanport, New Jersey

It's my pleasure to introduce you to our brand new, full service luxury wedding and special event venue located in Oceanport, NJ.  
  
Located on Historical Fort Monmouth, Park Loft is a truly unique 20,000 square foot, two-story luxury event space situated on a 4.5 acre property that includes a 1.5 acre Harmony Park and beautifully landscaped grounds. The original structure was constructed in 1941 to serve as a Dance Hall. We are at the final stages of a remarkable restoration and expansion that has produced a visually striking modern industrial venue with European and New Orleans design elements. We are minutes from NJ Transit and uniquely situated to deliver an elevated New York City-style event in the heart of New Jersey.  
  
We host only one event per day! We are a full service wedding and special event venue, staffed with a highly-trained team of professionals, and culinary artisans led by Executive Chef Thomas Schoborg. The Park Loft mission is to provide a remarkably unique venue, world class cuisine and spirits, served up with genuine hospitality. Our carefully assembled team has collectively produced and executed over one thousand weddings and special events! Park Loft is thoroughly prepared and genuinely honored to fulfill your most extraordinary day!  
  
Chef Thomas gained national recognition for his outstanding work in New York City at the Cub Room, Tribeca’s City Hall Restaurant and as Executive Chef with Rosa Mexicano. His reputation has landed him Executive Chef positions around the country, in D.C., Atlanta, Miami, and now here at Park Loft. He has crafted a unique and worldly menu, available for service in several reception styles.  
  
The Dance Hall accommodates up to 200 formally-seated guests, and is exclusively yours for your wedding event!
