# Hilton Garden Inn Suffolk, Virginia

The new Hilton Garden Inn Chesapeake/Suffolk hotel is the premier hotel in Northern Suffolk and borders the cities of Chesapeake and Portsmouth.  
Value is what drives guests to our smartly appointed mid-price hotels. The same applies to in-the-know couples, who have learned that they can have the same wedding planners, on-site banquet facilities, deliciously prepared food and top-notch service as they would experience at higher-priced hotels.
