# House of Blues Las Vegas Las Vegas, Nevada

The notoriously “cool” House of Blues is a multi-faceted venue that offers unique possibilities and reflects our signature “Juke Joint” atmosphere. It features a large collection of American folk art pieces including pictures, paintings, furniture and sculpture by renowned artists such as Jon Bok and “Mr. Imagination”.  
  
Our Foundation Room is located on the top of Mandalay Bay. Inspired by Eastern India and featuring Persian Carpet throughout, beautiful Chandeliers, and an eclectic display of Art from our private collection, the Foundation Room is a perfect mixture of sophistication and peacefulness. Enjoy a view of the entire Strip that could only be described as AWESOME! Any event held in the Foundation Room will prove to be a truly "Magical" and "Unforgettable" experience!
