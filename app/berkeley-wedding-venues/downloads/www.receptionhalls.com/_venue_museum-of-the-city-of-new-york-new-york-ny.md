# Museum of the City of New York New York, New York

Located at the top Fifth Avenue's iconic Museum Mile and directly across from Central Park’s Conservatory Gardens, the Museum of the City of New York boasts newly restored and renovated spaces that are perfect for every type of social gathering—weddings, bar and bat mitzvahs, engagement parties and more.  
  
There are beautiful and useful spaces throughout the Museum’s elegant landmark building as well as terraces facing Central Park. Guests entering the Museum from Fifth Avenue step into the beautiful Rotunda, the highlight of our grand Georgian-style mansion featuring a sweeping marble staircase and the striking contemporary light sculpture, Starlight. The stunning marble staircase leads to the second floor where the Marble Court, complete with French doors, overlooks Central Park. The 5th Ave Terrace and South Terrace are a rarity in New York City - an elevated and private terrace. Both are delightful in the summer months and can be tented in any season.  
  
After the completion of its ten-year, one hundred million dollar upgrade of our venue, the Museum is quickly becoming a highly sought after venue for social occasions, corporate events, non-profit fundraisers, and more.
