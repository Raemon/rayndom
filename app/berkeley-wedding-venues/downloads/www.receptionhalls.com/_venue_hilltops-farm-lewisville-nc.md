# Hilltops Farm Lewisville, North Carolina

Hilltops Farms is a beautiful, historic property located in the Northern portion of Forsyth County~right outside of Winston-Salem, NC.  
  
This is an outdoor venue but can handle weddings year round with appropiate tents. If you are looking for an outdoor wedding, surrounded by century old trees, green rolling hills and a beautiful pre-civil war home as a back drop this may be the place for you. There is certainly a romantic and peaceful feeling from the time you enter the property. There is alot of outdoor space with several options for setting up your wedding and/or reception. Looking forward to hearing from you.
