# Pedrottis Ranch Helotes, Texas

Pedrotti’s is a family-owned and operated event center for all occasions. We started catering in 1971 and began with a kitchen and a catering truck, catering exclusively off-premise events. Through the years, we have been faced with many challenges and welcomed many successes. In the early ’90s, our catering company served as the exclusive caterer for the Alamodome. We also catered off-premise at many locations, such as Southwest School of Arts & Crafts, McNay Art Institute and The King Ranch.
