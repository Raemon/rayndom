# 8443 WARNER Culver City, California

8443 Warner is the perfect place for private parties of up to 150 guests. The lounge is large and the furniture is new. The kitchen counters are butcher block and the bathroom is like a spa. The 1500 sq. ft. main room can be arranged to accommodate any function and has a dance floor with pre-hung disco lights.  
  
Play your own iTunes from your laptop through our wireless AirTunes or directly plug in an iPod. The Bose speakers drench the space in 5.1 Dolby surround sound. Or watch your favorite sports event through the Epson projector on the 12'Hx 20"W projection screen.
