# Green Meadows Farm Ijamsville, Maryland

Green Meadows Farm is a 124-acre historical farm in the rolling hills of the greater Washington, D.C. metro area and the southern part of Frederick County, Maryland. This unique Agri-tourism venue features nearly 300 farm animals as a picturesque backdrop or included as part of a couples special day. Couples may be married in the majestic 100+ year old hay barn or in the shadows of the stately white Manor house built circa 1790. Then, move to the rustic modern barn called “The Stables” as the perfect location for reception. Green Meadows Farm is 10 minutes south of Frederick, MD and 50 minutes from downtown Washington, D.C.  
  
Facilities and Capacity  
  
Green Meadows Farm is that one-of-a-kind venue every couple dreams of. The view of the rolling pastures with many types of animals, historic Manor house, old barns and majestic trees, will have guests in awe. The day begins with a ceremony in the Hay Mow as guests are seated on covered bales of hay for a unique, yet charming touch of country. The celebration continues as the party transitions to The Stables. The tall cathedral ceiling overhead is supported with beams of dark wood decorated with white lights and paper lanterns. The Stable’s capacity of 200 is perfect for year-round events. Summer wedding guests will appreciate the country breeze created by the opening of the Stable’s large double doors. Yet, the heated Stables will keep everyone warm during the chillier winter months. Hosting a wedding at Green Meadows Farm is the chance to stand-out from the ordinary and step into the extraordinary for a wedding that guests will be talking about for years.
