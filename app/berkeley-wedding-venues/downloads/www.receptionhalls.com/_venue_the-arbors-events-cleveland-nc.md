# The Arbors Events Cleveland, North Carolina

The Arbors Events is located on a 112-acre tree farm in western Rowan County. The farm began growing trees in 2003 and has matured over the years to become a beautiful landmark just outside the small town of Cleveland, NC. The farm is 15 minutes from Mooresville, NC and only 45 minutes north of Charlotte and 45 minutes southwest of Winston-Salem. The Arbors offers two unique indoor/outdoor venues that your guests will remember for years to come. The property was designed to give visitors the full experience of a working tree farm and is open to the public to purchase plants and trees.
