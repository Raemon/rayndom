# Four Peaks Brewing Co. - Wilson Taproom Tempe, Arizona

Welcome to Four Peaks Brewing Co.'s Wilson Taproom! This unique event space was built inside of our Wilson Production Facility -- the largest brewery operation in Arizona -- and provides you and your guests a view of all the action through our bar-top windows.  
  
Your guests can taste that action for themselves via a self-guided tour of the brewery followed by tasting some of our own beers on tap. This is some of the freshest brew around, as the beer is made, kegged and served all within the same building! We offer most Four Peaks mainstays along with some Single Tank and one-off brews. Ask us what we're pouring today! Wine is also served.  
  
Our catering menu ranges from classic pub fare to gourmet dishes served buffet-style. A majority of your favorites served on our 8th Street menu are available, along with some options you can't get anywhere but a Four Peaks-catered event.  
  
We have full A/V capabilities, TVs and projectors to show off slideshows or presentations (or the game -- we're not judging), space for a band or DJ, and yard games to keep you and your guests dancing, singing and playing the evening away.  
  
The floor seating at our space is entirely customizable (save for the built-in bar). We'd be happy to add, subtract or move tables that you think will best fit, well, you!  
  
Contact us today to come see the Wilson Taproom and plan your next event with us!
