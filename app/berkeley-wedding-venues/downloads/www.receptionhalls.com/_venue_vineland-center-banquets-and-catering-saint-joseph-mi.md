Your reception...  
Your celebration...  
A place created for you  
  
An elegantly appointed facility created with beautiful celebrations in mind, with ample free parking. A building that is entirely on one level and barrier free, Vineland Center was designed with flexibility and ease in mind.  
  
Vineland Center offers two separate banquet halls: The Vineyard Room and The Orchard Room. Depending on your wishes and the size of your guest list, these rooms can be used separately or in conjunction with one another.  
  
The spacious Vineyard Room is large enough for a gala event of 500 people or dividable into three smaller and more intimate areas. With the addition of the Orchard Room, you can have your ceremony and reception in one location. Our philosophy of flexible service and reasonable pricing allows you to rent just what you need. At Vineland Center, style is important but so is the comfort of your guests. Dimmable lighting, air conditioning, spacious round or square banquet tables with white or ivory tablecloths and your choice of linens, padded chairs, moveable dance floor, and portable bar, allows you to create a casual or elegant environment that is uniquely yours.  
  
The Way You Want It...  
  
The Catering Department…onsite and ready to take care of you!  
  
You get to be the perfect host as we take care of all the details. Our attentive, professional staff will lavish your guests with impeccable service and friendly hospitality. The Catering Department uses real china, flatware, glasses &amp; table linens to add a quality presentation to your party.
