**Guess the Song**

  * The club isn’t the best place to find a lover / So the bar is where I go
  * I let it fall, my heart / And as it fell, you rose to claim it
  * Party rock is in the house tonight / Everybody have a good time
  * When your legs don’t work like they used to before / And I can’t sweep you off of your feet
  * I’m hurting, baby, I’m broken down / I need your loving, loving, I need it now
  * City’s breaking down on a camel’s back / They just have to go ’cause they don’t know whack
  * Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they’re not shinin’
  * Wake up in the mornin’ feelin’ like P Diddy (hey, what up girl?)
  * If I should stay / I would only be in your way
  * I threw a wish in the well / Don’t ask me I’ll never tell
