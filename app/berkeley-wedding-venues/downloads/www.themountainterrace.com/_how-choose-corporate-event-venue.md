Corporate event planning can be an utterly exhausting job. From the managing the budget to motivating attendees to organizing the agenda, you are constantly juggling multiple tasks at once. Partnering with the right venue to host your team will not only alleviate much of that stress, but also help ensure that your corporate event is successful.

But how do you make sure you are choosing the right venue? There are a lot of factors to consider and the process can be draining. But have no fear, we have created a quick list to make it easier to choose your next corporate event venue.

#### 1\. Start Looking (and Planning) Early

First off, give yourself the gift of time and start the search well in advance. The top corporate event venues book quickly and if you wait too long you may find the best fit may not be available for your desired day. During this time, you will also want to consider your budget and start narrowing spaces down depending on how much you would like to spend. The venue can take up a lot of your overall event budget, so it’s important you know how much you want to allocate to the venue when you start planning.

#### 2\. Consider the Event Type and Size

Consider the type and size of the event you are planning on hosting. If planning to hold a meeting for 30 people, then of course you do not need to rent out a large ballroom or convention center. Choose a venue that creates the environment you want for attendees. You want to ensure the space reflects the atmosphere you are looking to achieve and supports the activities you plan to conduct. For instance, you would not want to have team building games in a small conference room. Instead look for flexible indoor or outdoor spaces where your team can spread out comfortably.

#### 3\. Pick the Right Location

Almost 80% of event planners say that location is the most common reason to choose a venue city. It is imperative you take into consideration where your attendees might be coming from and choose a central location. Aside from the city, you are also going to need to think about accessibility. How far is the venue from the office? How far from remote workers’ homes? What about access to public transit? Do you need overnight accommodations? How far is the venue from the airport?

#### 4\. Don’t Ignore the Rules and Regulations

Do not forget to talk to the venue about the rules and regulations that could impact your event logistics, because some of them might be deal breakers. Many venues have strict curfews, space limitations or vendor requirements. You do not want to craft an agenda that includes an outdoor garden reception at night only to find out when it’s too late that there is no external power allowed and the garden must close at sunset. Make sure you talk through all your plans and ideas with the corporate event planner at the venue so there are not any surprises on event day.

#### 5\. Amenities Can Make the Difference

Venues offer a wide range of included and optional amenities from chairs, to audio equipment, to onsite catering. You will want to make sure you consider what they offer and factor their expertise and value-added services into your decision. Onsite food and drink options can make your event stand out and was cited as one of the top factors to consider by 55% of event planners.

#### Take a Venue Tour!

While you are checking these items off your list, don’t forget to schedule a venue tour. (Nothing beats touring in person, but a virtual tour can save time as you conduct preliminary research.) Even in the formative stages of your event planning, tours are a great way to explore ideas with their staff and an opportunity to confirm all your research. This is a critical step that allows you to see first-hand how the venue aligns with your needs. Write down all your questions before your visit and make sure you come prepared.

While there are many factors in choosing a venue for your next corporate event, this list will help get you on your way.
