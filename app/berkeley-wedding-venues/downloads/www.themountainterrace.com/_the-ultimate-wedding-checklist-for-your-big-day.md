## **12+ Months Before the Wedding**

**1\. Establish a Budget:** The first step in planning a wedding is setting a realistic budget. Determine how much you are willing to spend on the entire event, including the ceremony, reception, attire, and other associated costs. Prioritize your expenses based on what matters most to you and your partner.

**2\. Create a Timeline:** Develop a timeline that outlines the key milestones leading up to the wedding day. This includes choosing a date, [**booking a venue**](https://www.themountainterrace.com/weddings/), sending out invitations, and other critical tasks. Having a timeline helps you stay organized and ensures that you have ample time to complete each task without feeling rushed.

**3\. Choose a Wedding Style:** Decide on the overall style and theme of your wedding. Whether it’s a traditional ceremony, a modern affair, a destination wedding, or a rustic celebration, establishing a theme will guide many of your decisions, from the venue to the decor.

**4\. Draft a Guest List:** Sit down with your partner and create a preliminary guest list. This will influence the size of the venue and impact other decisions like catering. Be mindful of your budget and consider how intimate or grand you want your celebration to be.

**5\. Select a Venue:** Choosing the right venue is a pivotal decision. Consider factors such as location, capacity, amenities, and ambiance. The venue should be a reflection of you and your partner and be comfortable for both of you. Schedule visits to potential venues and ask about availability, pricing, and any restrictions they may have. Be sure to ask what furniture items are included to avoid unnecessary rentals. Keep in mind that venues typically book 9-12 months in advance. Oftentimes, the venue will have an “in-house” planning/coordinating team which can be an enormous help on the day of the wedding.

## **9-12 Months Before the Wedding**

**1\. Book Vendors:** Research and book essential vendors, such as a photographer, videographer, caterer, florist, and entertainment. Check reviews, request quotes, and confirm availability—secure contracts to outline expectations and avoid any misunderstandings. The venue you choose should have a list of recommended vendors that they have worked with before and choose to recommend. This is a good starting place when you start looking for vendors.

**2\. Find the Perfect Dress:** Start shopping for your wedding attire well in advance. Consider the style, color, and budget for both the wedding gown and groom’s attire. Factor in alterations and fittings to ensure a perfect fit.

**3\. Wedding Attire and Accessories:** Selecting the perfect wedding attire is a significant decision for both the bride and groom. Brides should consider factors such as silhouette, fabric, and neckline that complement their body type. Grooms, on the other hand, should aim for a suit or tuxedo that complements the wedding theme and fits them well. It is also essential to consider accessories such as shoes, jewelry, and the veil, as these details can enhance your overall look and add a touch of personality to your ensemble. When making these selections, prioritize both comfort and style.

**4\. Send Save-the-Dates and Invitations:** Once the date and venue are secured, send out save-the-dates to give guests ample notice. Follow up with formal invitations, including essential details like RSVP instructions, dress code, and gift registry information.

**5\. Wedding Stationery and Paper Goods:** Your wedding stationery is an important aspect of your big day. It sets the tone and gives your guests a sneak peek into what they can expect. You can make it more creative by incorporating elements that reflect your wedding theme or personal interests. It is important to ensure that your chosen theme is carried throughout all stationery items, including RSVP cards, menus, and thank-you notes. When selecting paper and printing options, consider factors such as texture, color, and printing techniques to achieve the desired aesthetic.

## **6-9 Months Before the Wedding**

**1\. Plan the Ceremony:** Collaborate with your officiant to create a meaningful ceremony. Choose readings, select vows, and decide on any rituals or traditions you want to incorporate.

**2\. Organize Transportation:** Arrange transportation for the wedding party and guests, especially if the ceremony and reception are in a remote location. Confirm the logistics and ensure everyone arrives on time.

**3\. Finalize Decor and Details:** Work on the overall decor and details, such as centerpieces, table settings, and any personalized touches. Ensure that the decor aligns with your chosen theme and colors. Many times, the venue can provide a recommended vendor list to give you options.

**4\. Entertainment and Music:** Entertainment plays a vital role in any wedding celebration. It sets the mood and keeps guests engaged throughout the event. You should consider various options such as live bands, DJs, or even unique performers like magicians or acrobats to add an element of surprise. To cater to different parts of the wedding, create playlists that are appropriate for the ceremony, cocktail hour, reception, and dance party. You can further personalize your wedding and leave a lasting impression on your guests by arranging special dances or performances, such as a choreographed first dance or cultural presentations.

As you finalize these key details, remember that organizing your registry is crucial to seamless wedding planning. For a complete guide to help you stay prepared, explore **[The Ultimate Wedding Registry Checklist](https://www.themountainterrace.com/wedding-registry-checklist/)**.

## **4-6 Months Before the Wedding**

Be sure to taste the food with your caterer to get a sense of their cooking style and to help make your menu selections. Plan the reception timeline, including the entrance, toasts, cake cutting, and the first dance. If your budget permits, a wedding planner and or day-of-event coordinator can help with all of this to make it easier for you and your partner.

**2\. Create a Backup Plan:** Be prepared for unexpected challenges, especially if your wedding is outdoors. Have a backup plan in case of inclement weather or other unforeseen circumstances. If you choose an outdoor venue, consult with them on suggestions for a “backup plan”.

## **2-4 Months Before the Wedding**

**1\. Send Invitations –** Sending out wedding invitations is a crucial step in the planning process, marking the official announcement of your special day. Here’s how to ensure your invitations make a lasting impression.

**2\. Manage RSVPs:** Keep track of RSVPs and dietary preferences. Provide your caterer with the final guest count well in advance to ensure they can accommodate your needs.

**3\. Finalize Legalities:** Ensure all legal requirements for marriage are met. Obtain the necessary permits, marriage licenses, and any other documents required by your jurisdiction. Don’t forget to bring this paperwork to the wedding for your officiant to sign.

## **1-2 Months Before the Wedding**

**1\. Delegate Responsibilities:** As the wedding day approaches, delegate tasks to reliable friends or family members or your day of event coordinator. This can include managing the schedule, coordinating with vendors, distributing gratuities, and handling any last-minute details so you can focus on enjoying yourself!

## **1-2 Weeks Before the Wedding**

**1\. Confirm All Vendor Arrangements** : Reach out to all your vendors to confirm the final details. This includes the photographer, videographer, caterer, florist, entertainment, and any other services you’ve booked. Verify arrival times, services to be provided, and any special instructions. Make sure you have a clear understanding of the timeline and expectations for the day.

**2\. Ensure All Decor and Personal Touches Are Ready** : Review all your decor elements to ensure everything is ready and aligns with your vision. This includes centerpieces, table settings, signage, and any personalized touches you’ve planned. If you’re handling the decor yourself, organize everything in advance and label each item for easy setup. If a vendor or coordinator is managing this, provide them with detailed instructions and a clear vision of your desired outcome.

**3\. Enjoy Your Big Day:** On the wedding day, focus on savoring each moment. Trust that you’ve done the necessary planning, and allow yourself to fully immerse in the joy of the occasion. If you choose not to have a day of event coordinator, let someone you trust be the point of contact for questions or decisions that need to be made.
