Did you know the average couple spends 15 months planning their wedding? That’s like binge-watching “Friends” 40 times. But since each one of us has an ideal wedding day extravaganza planned in our heads, we can’t help but spend hours planning things out. We simply want that one day to be just PERFECT!

What kind of wedding theme would you like? Something that looks great in photos, evokes strong emotions, or has symbolic significance? With the right floral arrangements, you can make your wedding day as magical as your love story.  
  
Flowers have been used for wedding decorations for thousands of years. During the ancient Roman and Greek times, herbs and spices used to be mixed with flowers to keep spirits and bad luck away from the bride and groom. Later, during the Victorian era, flowers were used to be sent as gifts to the couple as a symbol of love. It was that time when flowers began to hold a meaning in weddings. Flowers continue to evoke feelings of love and romance, hope and beginnings, joy and celebration in modern weddings as well. With their pretty colors and sweet scents, flowers fill the air with happiness and refresh the room like a gentle air.

### 1\. **_Play with textures and heights_**

![Play with textures and heights](https://www.themountainterrace.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Play-with-textures-and-heights.jpg)

  * Create a focus point by designing a bouquet or some other centerpiece that grabs the attention of the guests. The flower that you use shouldn’t just sit in the container but should overflow. Try to go for long-stemmed flowers like Calla Lily and Orchids to achieve this arrangement.


  * Skip the boring vase and go for something unique like hanging a jar filled with colorful flowers. You can use a vintage basket overflowing with flowers that gives a rural touch to the decor.


  * You can also try an arrangement consisting of big and soft flowers like peonies along with some tiny or detailed wildflowers. Then mix them up with some green leaves like ferns for a unique look.



### 2\. **_Use the magic of colors_**

![Use the magic of colors](https://www.themountainterrace.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Use-the-magic-of-colors.jpg)

  * Choose any bold color that you like. It can be yellow, blue, red, anything! Once you are done deciding the color, put different flowers in that shade and texture together. The outcome will surprise you.


  * You can create a rainbow with colorful flowers. Just pick up a vase and fill it up with flowers ranging from a shade of light to dark. A combination of lavender tulips and dark purple orchids would be the best choice.



In this type of arrangement, you just have to play with colors.

### **_3\. Think beyond the bouquet_**
