"We had our wedding on Oct. 16, 2023 - this was a day to remember for the both of us. Everything was done according to plan and we very much appreciate the help of our wedding coordinator Anastasia. She's very organized and made sure everything was done to our liking. She was very calm and made sure our wedding was stress free. If you are planning to get an awesome wedding coordinator then please request for Anastasia." 

-Regeena Umali

"Attended a family wedding here. It’s a beautiful venue that offers indoor bar and dance floor space, terrace for dinner and outdoor patio for wedding ceremony. The place is well maintained and seemed really well managed." 

-Michael Travels

"The Mountain Terrace is such a beautiful venue! The view is amazing, the food is very yummy and the staff were outstanding. My daughter was married there 5.22.22 and it was such a magical day. All our guests were so impressed and full of compliments. We worked with Caren and she was so helpful and always responded to any questions we had very quickly. Julie helped us on the day of the event and made certain everything was perfect. I am so happy we chose The Mountain Terrace for such a special day!" 

-Douglas R. Roth, DDS

"This venue is absolutely stunning! We fell in love with it from the first tour we took! We knew it was the place for us! Planning an event here was the easiest thing to do even from long distance! The whole team was so wonderful and accommodating they were even especially sweet to our fur babies who were in the wedding! Dinner was delicious and beautiful and the reception was a blast anyone who joined definitely never once went without! The service was impeccable! Honestly after all was said and done I wished we could have done it all over again!" 

-Meagan Amanda

"I've worked as a photographer at The Mountain Terrace a handful of times over the past two years and can just say that it is one of my absolute favorite venues. Every wedding is so different, but the deck keeps a really intimate backyard feel throughout the reception for friends and family to really spend quality time together. The ceremony site facing redwoods is SO beautiful and the redwood grove on site makes for some beautiful portraits at any time of day." 

-Megan Morton

"We Highly recommend The Mountain Terrace. My name is Anthony and I'm the owner of The Booth Bus, we're a vintage VW Bus photo booth company and we have attended countless events over the years at TMT and can say with the utmost confidence, you will not be disappointed if you select them as your venue. The Mountain Terrace will become your partner to successfully deliver on what you envision for your event." 

-The Booth Bus

"We had our wedding here on June 2, 2023! The venue is simply breathtaking. The views, the trees, and the well-kept grass enhanced all my wedding photos! The appetizers and food were delicious! Shout out to Chef Benny and his team! Everyone from the planning process (Caren is the best) was easy and all my questions were always answered promptly.." 

-Cindy C.

"Our wedding day happened to fall within the biggest 10 day storm in CA in 150 years (no joke). The storm ripped a few holes on the tent and our floor plans had to be changed multiple times 2 days prior to the event. TMT and staff worked relentlessly day and night coming up with fixes of the tent, and coming up alternatives arrangement so we could still have our vision come true. To be honest, the weather forecasted that it would be sunny two days after our wedding..." 

-Wennie H.

"We had our wedding at The Mountain Terrace in June and the venue was wonderful! Our friends had an amazing time. Our coordinator helped us immensely with the day-of events as well as planning and keeping us on track. The food was amazing, and the redwoods view is breathtaking. The vibe is very relaxed but still formal enough to feel special. Would definitely recommend this venue." 

-Tencia L.

"We're a few weeks post our wedding, and I wish I could do it over again! The Mountain Terrace was such a beautiful venue, and the people who work there are so great. I was so stress-free leading up to and during the wedding, so I give major kudos to the staff for their help..." 

-Katie Y.

"We had our wedding at Mountain Terrace in March and it was perfect! We received so many compliments on the food and venue. The plated meals were hot and SO delicious. The weather was amazing, and the redwood grove was such a special treat, especially for folks who traveled in from the midwest. Mountain Terrace was extremely helpful throughout the entire planning process..." 

-Nora S.

"We chose the Mountain Terrace because we wanted a forested outdoor venue, and immediately fell in love. The team did an excellent job at guiding us through the entire wedding planning process. Kristy Meinhardt in particular was amazing. She answered our many questions in a timely fashion, and made accommodations for our concerns about having a wedding during a pandemic."

I recently photographed a wedding at The Mountain Terrace and I have to say - this venue is beautiful! I love the redwoods that surround the ceremony site. They make for a beautiful backdrop. The food was great and their planner, Kristy Meinhardt, did a phenomenal job at executing their vision. A great venue to work with and from my perspective, a great venue to have your wedding at!
