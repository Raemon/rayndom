### **1.** **Bohemian Décor**

Boho wedding is all about a wedding theme that feels like a beautiful painting where you can express yourself freely. You can picture dream catchers hanging from the trees, tangled macramé and colorful rug spread across the ground. Adding a mix of these elements will add seven stars to your wedding decor. 

Instead of choosing an indoor venue, you can go for outdoor settings. It could be a sandy beach, a grassland, peaceful forests or even mountains. You can wear flowy and comfortable outfits.

Brides can wear silhouettes, flower crowns, and even go barefeat. The idea is to feel relaxed and connected to nature. Try infusing your love story into every detail. Write heartfelt vows and design a playlist that reflects your shared adventures.

### **2.** **Modern Minimalism**

By choosing modern minimalism as your wedding theme, you will create a centerstage for simplicity. The major elements of the modern minimalist wedding theme is the use of clean lines, geometric shapes, neutral color patterns (White, black, gray or nude) and natural textures. You can go for simple table arrangements, minimalist, centerpieces and achieve a clean sophisticated look by adding wood, stone and glass to the decor.

To give this wedding theme a personal touch, add subtle elements like the flowers from your first date. You can play with colors that reflect your personalities, this could be a color you both love. Set up a fun photo booth that reflects your personality and interest. 

Instead of going with the boring guest books, create a memory wall, where the guests can write a message or leave a polaroid on the wall. Minimalism is about balance, so add your personal touches to enhance the theme instead of overwhelming it.

### **5\. Nature-Inspired Wedding Decor**

Greenery is an essential aspect of your wedding decor. Nowadays, brides are increasingly seeking inspiration from nature for their weddings. We recommend incorporating greenery in bouquets, flower arrangements, and table centerpieces. Choose greenery that complements the season of your wedding. 

For winter weddings, consider using fir branches, while for spring weddings, eucalyptus can add a lot of beauty. The use of real greenery in your decor is eco-friendly and biodegradable. You can also use fresh herbs to enhance your flower arrangements and add a fresh fragrance to the room.

### **6.**Botanical Garden Wedding Theme****

Imagine saying your vows surrounded by lush greenery, vibrant blooms, and the gentle hum of nature. A botanical garden theme brings the outdoors in, creating an oasis of tranquility and elegance.

To personalize this theme, choose flowers that hold meaning for you as a couple—maybe a bloom from your first bouquet or the scent of the flowers where you first met.

Incorporate cascading vines, floral arches, and garden trellises to add a dreamy touch to the space. For outfits, brides can embrace floral embroidery or delicate leafy patterns, while grooms can complement the look with boutonnières inspired by the decor.

Enhance the vibe with botanical-inspired cocktails and invite guests to take home potted plants as meaningful favors.

An eco-friendly wedding is perfect for couples who value sustainability without compromising on style.

Think biodegradable decor, local flowers, and repurposed elements that reflect a love for the planet.

Personalize this theme by including reusable tableware, eco-friendly invitations, or even plantable wedding favors. Swap confetti for flower petals or eco-glitter.

Keep the food menu sustainable by choosing local and organic dishes that align with the season.

Instead of lavish centerpieces, opt for potted herbs or succulents that double as gifts for your guests. For your attire, consider sustainable or preloved wedding outfits for a unique and conscious touch.

## **Tips for Reviving the Classics Wedding Themes with a Modern Flair**

What if you love classic, vintage weddings, while your partner craves a modern, trendy vibe? Sweat not! We can help you create a wedding theme that blends the timeless elegance you like with your partner’s modern flair. Here are some tips to achieve the perfect mix!

### **1\. Modernize the Color Palettes**

Classic weddings used to feature color combinations like, white pastels, lavender, or pink. These colors are indeed elegant and have been in demand in wedding themes for a long time. To modernize this classic palette, you can use some vibrant colors to the decor like, bold metallics (gold or rose gold). These colors will definitely elevate the overall aesthetics of the decor. You can also go for neon shades since they are associated with a modern, youthful and energetic vibe.

### **2\. Upgrade the Venue**

Consider selecting a classic venue, such as a grassy meadow with views of the bay peeking through a redwood grove. These types of venues are popular due to their outdoor dining options on the expansive redwood deck, which allows your wedding guests to take in the breathtaking views. Alternatively, opt for the rustic beauty of a country-style lodge, which provides a cozy and intimate backdrop for your wedding.

### **3\. Contemporary Couture**

Give traditional wedding attire a modern makeover by blending classic styles with the latest fashion trends. The bride can begin with traditional elements such as lace.

Lace has been a staple in wedding gowns for centuries because of its delicate look. Take the classic lace detail and add it into a gown with a modern silhouette or cut. The groom can wear a classic tuxedo and to add a modern flair select suits in unique colors beyond the traditional black, navy, or gray.

This approach to wedding attire is about creating a balance that celebrates the best of both worlds.

### **4\. Entertainment with a Twist**

Focus on creating a memorable musical atmosphere by creating a blend of classic music and the vibrant energy of contemporary beats. Go for those forms of traditional music that have been there for generations, like classical pieces, jazz, or iconic love songs that stood the test of time. The twist comes in when you infuse these classic tunes with contemporary beats. You can either hire a band or DJ who can artfully mix older hits with today’s top chartbusters.

### **5\. Reimagined Florals**

Floral wedding arrangements never go out of trend and you can present them in innovative and contemporary arrangements by mixing traditional with modern designs. You can handpick flowers that are timeless in nature like roses, peonies, hydrangeas or orchids. Moving away from traditional bouquets and centerpieces, you can go for innovative and unconventional displays. 

You can transform an ordinary ceiling into a floral one to level up the decor game. By repurposing flowers this way, you can strike a balance between the natural beauty of flowers and the innovative appeal of modern design.
