## The Mountain Terrace shout out to front line heroes!

We have several couples that are working on the front lines of the coronavirus crisis and to personally thank them for caring for our community, our team sent handwritten notes to tell them we know how hard it has been, and we appreciate everything they are doing to keep us and our families safe.

## Kings Mountain School

Dear Mountain Terrace Owners,

On behalf of Kings Mountain School students and staff, I would like to thank you for your generous support of our school. The funds raised at the KMAP event you hosted at Mountain Terrace provide staffing, programs and materials that support the academic, behavioral, social and emotional success for all students at Kings Mountain School. The Sweetheart Social at Mountain Terrace was a tremendous community builder as well.

Every year the Cabrillo Unified School District, in conjunction with San Mateo County Office of Education and the Half Moon Bay Chamber of Commerce extend invitations for community members to visit schools as Principal for the Day. We would be honored to have any or all of the Mountain Terrace owners join us at Kings Mountain School. I apologize for the short notice, but warmly extend the invitation to join us at Kings Mountain School.

Kindest regards,  
Diane Siegel
