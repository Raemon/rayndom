The Mountain Terrace is actively responding to the Impact of the coronavirus on our clients and our organization. We will provide regular updates to our event venue operations and business practices as needed. We continue to monitor coronavirus updates by Governor Newsom and local officials of any changes to the phased reopening plan and will update our response accordingly.

#### Our Response

During the time we were not permitted to be open to the public, The Mountain Terrace team prepared for welcoming guests again by creating new ways to provide a safe, unique space for your wedding or event, while following all government guidelines. So, in addition to our complete list of enhanced sanitation protocols including masks, additional hand washing stations, and protective door openers, I wanted to share several other enhancements that we are excited to make available.

#### Enhancements to Our Event Venue

Our team has developed a selection of modified seating plans, ceremony locations, safe food station style receptions, and a fun silent disco to dance under the stars while still following the rules of social distancing. Plus, to include those guests unable to attend in person, we have added a live streaming option so that no one will miss out on being a part of your wedding celebration or event. Please reach out to your planner or me directly if you want to learn more.

#### Ready to Get Back to Your Wedding Planning? We Are Too!

We get it. We talk to couples every day and trying to plan anything during these times is a challenge. While not ideal for all weddings, event venues have been approved for events of up to 50 people with proper social distancing. If you are interested in exploring this option, please reach out and we’ll work with you to create a customized package for your special day.

#### Special Note for Upcoming Weddings

For clients with dates booked in the next 60 days who are not interested in a 50 person event, we are offering the option of re-scheduling to a future date. Fall and Winter weddings are a great option at The Mountain Terrace. Our beautiful clear tent with café lighting and heat is up from mid-November through the beginning of April.

I will continue to update you as the situation evolves. Please let me know your thoughts, and if you have ideas for how we can better help you navigate this unprecedented time, we’d love to hear them as our only goal is help make your wedding or event memorable.
