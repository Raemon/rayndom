While the traditional go-to places for corporate events have often been local hotels and conference rooms, there are many unique outdoor spaces for planners to consider. (And now, they may be your only option given current social distancing restrictions).

With proper outdoor venue selection, you reduce the amount of extra “entertainment” value needed to support your main agenda. Being at a rustic location, you have your own wooded backdrop for activities that adds a nature-filled atmosphere to your meetings, classes, training, and networking sessions. Energize attendees with team-building experiences in settings that provide visual inspiration and facilitate an out-of-the-box, problem-solving mindset. Watch your attendance and participation grow as everyone in your organization wants to attend the event you planned in that “cool outdoor space” creating buzz around the office.

Recreation and Parks departments in the area such as [San Francisco](https://sfrecpark.org/) and [South San Francisco](https://www.ssf.net/departments/parks-recreation/recreation-division) can be good sources to brainstorm ideas for options for your next event. Outdoor spaces have a wealth of value to offer while promoting physical, mental, and emotional fitness. Ropes courses, hiking, or even a corporate Olympics can be excellent team-building activities.

For more ideas, you can also investigate venues of historical value or even popular tourist destinations such as:

• National and state parks  
• Museums  
• Old railway stations  
• Waterside restaurants  
• Beach, lake, or mountain settings  
• Facilities with cabins or glamping tents

Impress your team with a non-traditional space for your next business meeting, training session, product launch, or workshop.
