## WEDDING COMPLIMENTS

The Mountain Terrace is a perfect balance between beautiful venue, amazing food, affordability and staff professionalism. We’ve researched over 10 venues around the San Francisco Bay Area and found this venue to be the best option. Here is why Beautiful – the venue is nestled within the Sequoia and Redwood trees in the Santa Cruz Mountains. It has an expansive view of the peninsula below. Amazing food – I think the coordinator mentioned that their kitchen received awards. Either way, the in-house food options were very good. Affordable – this is a good price for what you’re getting. Staff Professionalism – all of the staff were very professional and treated the guests with respect.

### 

From my husband and I, we would like to extend our warmest gratitude to the entire crew of Mountain Terrace! You guys made our day special and ran without a glitch! Without Denise and the crew, our day wouldn’t have been as successful and perfect! Thank you to everyone at the Mountain Terrace for making our day!

### 

I want to thank you and your team for a wonderful evening at Mountain Terrace last night. The group loved the entire experience. You AND your team could not have been more accommodating, courteous, professional. In fact, I wish to add that working with you from the get go has been a pleasure. David cooks up a mean ribeye. It was SO good! Everyone at my table cold not stop raving about it. Denise was a pleasure to work with and please thank her for the lovely floral arrangements. They looked great on the tables. Our client told us today that he wishes to run this exact same program again before the end of the year because it was so well received by everyone present. Therefore, I’m sure we’ll be talking again real soon.

### 

Thank You, Thank You, Thank You. There are not enough words to express our heartfelt gratitude. We so very much respect who you are and what you represent. And most of all the love that you share. Everyone raved about the beauty of the venue and the extremely delicious food. Thank you for being there every step of the way. Our day was magical and full of love. And all that I had envisioned as my Wedding Day. Thank you so very much, again!!

### 

I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for the great collaboration we had to make Anna’s wedding a success. You’re team is such an amazing team, the food is something to die for and the ambience such a place of romance, what can one still ask for!

### 

What made the venue more beautiful was your wonderful team! Mel and I agree that we have never met a team so on top of things! Your timing and ability to adjust to the program was key along with your great communication! We also thoroughly enjoyed our dinner! By far thee best duck we’ve had! Thank you so much for your professionalism and for having such a great team! We hope to work with you all again and wish you the best!

### 

The event was wonderful. The venue exceeded my expectations and Denise and Colleen were personable, professional and super attentive to every little detail and need. Bobbi was a great bar-tender and all the other support staff was pleasant, helpful and engaged. I am sooo happy we decided to go with your venue – we had many options on the table but indeed this was the best one. The care and professionalism exuded were invaluable to me, my family and our friends. You made our celebration super special and I thank you from the bottom of my heart.  


### 

I wanted to thank you for the lovely event that Caren, Charisse, Denise, et al. made possible for my wedding on March 5th. Everyone has been raving about the food, the bar, how much fun they had, how beautiful the place is, etc. You have great staff and if I could, I’d throw a party at TMT every year!

### 

I want to say thank you so much to YOU (for many things really!!!) for paying such close attention to the notes I left for you and for passing all of that info along to make sure all the things I asked for happened on our wedding day. I can’t think of anything I requested that didn’t happen. It really meant a lot to me that you were so attentive and took all the requests so seriously. THANK YOU!!! David and I have both highly recommended MT to our friends and family. One of David’s friends already booked her daughter’s wedding at MT for next summer.

### 

I was recently in a wedding at Mountain Terrace. I just wanted to make sure I sent a thank you to everyone involved. Your staff was fantastic. I happen to be the only girl on the groom’s side and I wore a tux, and your staff was so cute about it. “girl wearing a tux? very cool!” Stuff like that. There were two women I wanted to give a special thanks to… Denise and Charisse. They were AMAZING!!! If we needed anything, they would bend over backwards to make it happen. Can’t say enough about them. Thank you again for making that magical day even more magical.

### 

The entire family wants to tell you what a fabulous job you and your staff did at the rehearsal dinner. Everything was just as we had anticipated and the food was absolutely excellent. The tables and chairs (along with the candle center pieces that we provided) looked extremely elegant. The way your staff decorated the buffet table with plants and decorations made a beautiful food presentation as well. The hors d’oeuvres were served hot and there was not one person that your staff missed while the appetizers were being offered. The main course was also superbly delicious and the assorted miniature desserts could not have been more perfect. All the guests were very impressed and we were very satisfied with your company’s performance. We would not hesitate to use your company again.  


### 

THANK YOU for a beautiful, magical night we will always remember. We had endless raves about the venue all night long, and Rob and I just loved it and the layout was excellent for the party’s energy. Your staff rocked big time, and I was amazed at how smoothly the meal was served, tables were cleaned, and everything was cleaned up by the end of the night. I anticipated a much tougher exit, and you guys did all the heavy lifting. The chef also deserves a big thank you, and that meal was the best I’ve ever had at a wedding (and guests reported the same) — fine restaurant quality. Also, there were indeed still last minute changes and I appreciate how expertly you guys attended to these matters. So incredibly happy we had our event at Mountain Terrace — I will treasure it.

### 

We’d also like to thank the Chef and kitchen folks for pulling off our veggie feast. While there were a few ‘where’s the meat’ jokes (as to be expected), everyone really loved all the food (as did we for a number of nights to follow!). We hope you can use aspects of our wedding as a reference for similar ‘green wedding’ requests in the future. And thanks to you for all the help in planning for the event, and for being so open and receptive to our questions and requests. We will highly recommend The Mountain Terrace at every opportunity.

### 

On the behalf of everyone involved with putting the wedding together from our end, I wanted to thank you and your staff for running a beautiful, absolutely first-class operation. From the setting to the excellent dinner and service from your very capable staff, the day couldn’t have been any better for Brian and Diana’s wedding. As an example of how “on top of it” your staff was, my wife Maya was getting an extra plate from the buffet line for her mother, who has problems getting around. One of your staff saw that and offered to put the plate together and took the plate right over to her mother. Seemingly small things like that really make a big difference, and it was just one of many examples of what you and your staff do for the customers to make an extraordinary event. We will certainly be referring Mountain Terrace to any of our family and friends looking for a wonderful outdoor setting for their events. Thank you again for making our son and new daughter-in-law’s day truly memorable!

### 

What a great chance to reminisce and wax nostalgic about what is hands down the best day of my LIFE. Ben and I seriously had no idea we would enjoy the day as much as we did – and it’s all thanks to you! Everything about the day was perfect – and our friends and family still say, ‘Where did you FIND the Mountain Terrace? It was SO beautiful, and so you guys!’ We really owe you so much, Caren. You were so wonderful to work with, and now you’re always going to be in our hearts. One thing I’ll never forget is you coming to us with hors d’oeuvres while we were taking pictures. I was famished, and you were like this angel from Heaven. Seriously. Your presence was just so calm, soothing, you were so present, so nurturing, and so professional … just couldn’t have asked for anything more. Thank you again, Caren. Ben and I would do it all over again, just to work with you again!

### 

I just wanted to give a big shout out to Caren, Denise, Charisse and your staff for a job well done! Thank you for attending to the endless details and our endless questions…we really appreciate your patience and professionalism. The wedding came off without a hitch from our standpoint and that of our guests, as many have come forward with compliments on the beauty of the venue and the overall event. You have a beautiful venue with the added value of allowing us to personalize it to our tastes. I also want to say that we received many compliments on the food. And we all appreciated Denise and her service with a smile. It’s clear that you all love what you do.

### 

I just wanted to thank you and all the staff at The Mountain Terrace. You really made my (our LOL) exact vision come true and I am so grateful! The venue and set up looked stunning!! The food was wonderful (I’m still hearing raving about those ravioli!) and the service was fantastic. So thank you guys again for the hard work and making our wedding such a memorable experience. 

### 

Grace and John will be giving you a glowing review on Weddingwire etc. when they return from their honeymoon but I wanted to add my personal thanks for all you did to make their wedding the wonderful celebration it was for them. From our first contact, every single interaction with the entire staff was welcoming and supportive and we are grateful to you all for making it a positive experience for us. We so appreciated Emily’s skilled handling of the changes that day and the way she worked with the experienced staff to smooth over any gaffs that arose as a result of miscommunication between the families. And we would like to thank all of you for your planning expertise and sage advice as well as the extra work that was involved in making the last minute arrangements we had not anticipated. The guests all raved about the beauty of the venue and the fabulous food and service (the woman with the food allergy was especially appreciative of the care that was taken for her) and I’m sure it will be a wonderful memory for all. 

### 

We are over the moon delighted with the way every thing turned out on Friday. I am totally and completely exhausted, but elated and delirious about the magical wedding that you helped to orchestrate. You were beyond fantastic and all of us appreciate your efforts on our behalf, more than we can say. From creating the perfect weather (that was you wasn’t it?) to answering the questions, to insuring that it all flowed, and LOADING THE VAN (huge help). You are the best and I am happy to shout it from the rooftops, or Alice’s Restaurant at the very least. THANK YOU times a million….hope to see you sometime running around town, so I can exclaim how wonderful you are. And by the way the Pimm’s cup drinks were fantastic – this from the Brit’s. The staff was amazing, the food incredible (especially those tuna cones), and the service impeccable. Truly the best wedding ever….You ROCK!

### 

We were so pleased with the way everything turned out, all of our guests commented on what a beautiful venue we had chosen :) The food and service was impeccable. I was running late (under estimated time for hair and makeup)! Which cut our cocktail hour short, but with the help of friends and family we were able to fit everything into the morning time slot. 

### 

Thank you so much for all of your care with us, we know that you have so many couples to cater to, but we truly felt that you treated us as your only wedding! Thank you for EVERYTHING and take good care. 

### 

We enjoyed every minute of our wedding at The Mountain Terrace. The natural beauty is stunning and the staff are excellent. I am very glad we paid for their wedding coordinator services. Brooke was so helpful throughout the planning process, and she kept everything flowing smoothly during the event. 

### 

We had a wonderful experience working with Caren (planner) and Brooke (day of coordinator) for our wedding. They were both very responsive to all of our questions and were very accommodating. Although we had a short window of time (2 hours) to set up our Saturday evening wedding they worked closely with our vendors to make it all come together. Brooke did an excellent job of staying very organized and keeping me calm during the hiccups (I.e. accident on the road just before the ceremony, power outage from PG&E). Luckily TMT has a generator so everything moved along as planned! It was a beautiful evening and we had a great time. Thank you!

### 

We recently had our wedding ceremony and reception at The Mountain Terrace and cannot say enough positive things about the venue and its staff. From the very first time we visited, we felt welcomed and supported. The staff took time to sit down with us upon arrival and walk through all the details involved with the space. They answered all of our questions before we even asked, which was very impressive and not necessarily the experience we had when visiting other venues. They also gave us honest, straight forward answers and never pressured us into any extra or unnecessary expenses. This level of support and amazing customer service continued throughout the year+ of wedding planning.

### 

We decided to add the wedding coordination service and are so glad that we did. Brooke Bauer was our coordinator and she was simply AMAZING. She was so responsive throughout the planning process, answering all of our questions honestly and quickly. She kept us on track and followed up to ensure that everything was taken care of according to their timeline…in summary, she was super organized, which put us at ease.

### 

The rest of the Mountain Terrace staff were also incredible and very accommodating of our guests. The venue itself is just amazing. We wanted a laidback yet high quality event and that was exactly what the space provided. The space also just flows so well…the position of the dance floor (right next to the bar and deck) allowed for guests to easily mingle and go back and forth between the indoor and outdoor space throughout the evening.

### 

Thank you, thank you, thank you to all the staff at The Mountain Terrace – we truly could not be more grateful and pleased with how everything went and will be reliving the day for a very long time!!

### 

I love the Mountain Terrace so much! My husband and I are so very glad and grateful that we chose it for our wedding, which was just last week.

### 

So first — for the general stuff — and then onto our wedding coordinator, Brooke Bauer, whose praises I can’t sing loudly enough! (We love you, Brooke!!!) The venue is breathtakingly beautiful and being there felt grounded, simple, easy. It’s rustic of course but also well appointed and classy. There’s nothing too fussy or precious, so it’s a great match for my husband and I in terms of style. Both the sales staff (hey Casey!) and Brooke, our coordinator, were genuine, kind, and professional. They were really straightforward and honest with us, giving recommendations on where to splurge and where to save. We never felt pushed into anything, surprised by unexpected charges, or that we were being nickel and dimed — all of which gave me anxiety when I contemplated selecting a wedding venue.

### 

We were impressed and delighted by the Mountain Terrace’s chef and had such a great time at our tasting, where they made us feel like royalty! We also really enjoyed staying at the Terrace Suite, a beautiful 4-bedroom house adjacent to the property which we rented for an additional fee the night before the wedding (my bridesmaids and I) and then the night of the wedding (my husband and I). It made for a great place to have hair and makeup done the day of the wedding too. Conveniently, there are two wings of the house and two entrances — so the bridal party gents got ready in one wing and the bridal party ladies got ready in the other. 

### 

We are SUPER grateful for Brooke, our wedding coordinator at the Mountain Terrace. Hiring Brooke was worth every penny. Brooke is so warm, down to earth and flexible, and she was always up for answering questions over text, email or phone. (I think I must have emailed her at least 20 times in the 2 days before the wedding and each time she responded promptly and in good humor!) She was super helpful, informative, and reassuring as she walked my husband and I through all the choices we would need to make in the run up to the wedding. She also did a great job of handling a million random details and requests; wrangling about 25 bridal party and family members during the rehearsal; suggesting smart ‘game day decisions’ about our schedule; and ensuring that all of our set up items (photos, favors, menus, etc) were deployed and recollected in excellent condition. Our wedding day went so smoothly and beautifully. Thank you, Brooke and everyone at the Mountain Terrace!

### 

We had a wonderful time at our wedding at The Mountain Terrace. When we first toured the venue we fell in love the the natural beauty and towering redwoods, and on the day itself it felt even more beautiful.

### 

In the lead up to the event all the staff were extremely helpful and organized in getting all the details worked out with us. They provided guidance on what worked well at other weddings and what sort of things we might want to consider. The food they offer is delicious, with the right mix of classic and fancy.

### 

We got same day coordination with Brooke, which worked out perfectly! Brooke was super helpful in the weeks before the wedding by coordinating details with vendors. On the day itself she really helped everything run smoothly and keep to the timeline. She made sure to let us know of the upcoming wedding activities, but also let us enjoy time with our guests. Having Brooke meant that we could sit back and really enjoy our big day, and know that everything will be handled. She also always kept our glasses full!

### 

A few things to consider with the venue though is that there is no amplified music or speeches outdoors. We ended up doing the speeches indoors with the DJ’s mic, which we thought actually worked out quite well. But we did have problems finding a live musician to perform for the ceremony. We found it difficult to select live musicians that we liked and would be loud enough without amplification. We ended up choosing a guitarist, which was somewhat difficult for some of our guests to hear. Otherwise, everything else with the venue worked out perfectly and we would absolutely recommend them!

### 

This venue is not only beautiful, but the team is amazing and food is delicious. Before my wedding, I was focusing mostly on the food and the look of the venue, but I want to emphasize the awesome team of staff. Before the wedding, Brooke was super helpful and responsive to all my questions. On the day of, she was a lifesaver. She really contributed to ensuring I was stress free by taking care of everything. All the concerns I had she had already taken care of, so there was no need to stress. They also exceed my expectations and provided additional decor that I didn’t have, but she thought would fit nicely. Everything turned out perfectly and TMT played a large role in that!! The team is so efficient and transitioned all the events seamlessly and with grace.

### 

For anyone that is worried about the sounds from motorcycles, don’t worry about it. We weren’t able to hear it during the ceremony so it didn’t impact!

### 

## CORPORATE EVENTS COMPLIMENTS

If you are searching for a venue to host a team or company event, look no further. Mountain Terrace was an absolute joy to work with. Lindsay and Casey (the two lovely professionals who helped me build my event) were thorough, kind, good humored, and communicative from inquiry to clean up post-event.

### 

I have almost a decade of event planning experience, and about 5 years of planning in the Bay Area. This was one of the easiest venues I’ve ever worked with. Mountain Terrace is removed from the Bay Area madness, but close enough so you don’t have to spend hours on a shuttle to get there. It’s a gorgeous and lush setting with an array of spaces available to craft and mould to your event. The team had an absolute blast, the food was DELICIOUS, and a good time was had by all. I highly recommend!

### 

We had a great company offsite at The Mountain Terrace. It was in December and they had their tent up which was perfect. We were able to be outside and not freezing and protected from the weather.

### 

Dawn and Don were amazing support the day of. I had some random things happen and they were able to fix it right away without my guests knowing anything about it. I would highly recommend this place for an offsite. It is close enough to the Valley but once you are on the property you feel like you are tucked away in the mountains. The food and drinks were amazing too!

### 

Had an unbelievable Holiday Party here last Friday night. Lindsay was amazing and super responsive in the days leading up to the event and Dawn was absolutely on top of everything the day of the event. The entire staff was wonderful and exceeded expectations, making my job a lot easier. It was pouring the night of, which didn’t even matter because there was a nice tarp on the outside area, and the inside was decorated for the Holiday season. We were supposed to be roasting s’mores for dessert, but due to the rain were unable to. It didn’t matter though as the team made sure to roast them in the kitchen for us :) I had originally looked at this location for the gorgeous view, but stayed for the amazing service, staff, and atmosphere. Cherry on top: there is a tiny black cat named Obie who is the friendliest little feline in the world. 

### 

We went down to get coffee came back up to get our things and the smell of pot punched you in the face it was sickening. So there’s nothing wrong with that since they have the partitions between the chairs. Once you see the option, fried haddock served with house-made coleslaw <https://onlinekaszinok.org/>.
