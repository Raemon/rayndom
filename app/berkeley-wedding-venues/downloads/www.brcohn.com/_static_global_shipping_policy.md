# Shipping Policies

Wine must be delivered to an address where an individual of at least 21 years of age is available to **sign for the package** during regular business hours. If you are not usually home during the day, we recommend shipping to a business address, such as a local [FedEx Office](https://local.fedex.com/en-us).

Due to state laws, **we are unable to ship wine to DE, RI and UT.** If you live in these states, you can still send wine as a gift to someone in an eligible state!

## Shipping Rates

Our shipping rates are based on the weight of the individual package, where the package is to be delivered, and the shipping method selected. To check shipping rates, select the state at checkout.

## Shipping Times

Orders may take up to 48 hours to prepare prior to shipping. Orders only ship Monday-Friday. If an order is placed on Friday, it will not ship until the following Monday. Depending upon your state, standard ground shipping is approximately 2 to 10 business days from leaving our warehouse.

California: 2 to 3 business days

The delivery carrier (UPS or FedEx) will make up to 3 delivery attempts, requiring an adult 21 years or older to sign for the package. If you are not usually home during the day, we recommend shipping to a business address, such as a local [FedEx Office](https://local.fedex.com/en-us).

By law, an adult 21 years or older must sign for wine shipments. The delivery carrier (UPS or FedEx) will make up to 3 attempts to deliver your wine, after which the package will be returned to us.

If you wish to reship your wine, we offer a $30 flat rate per package for standard ground shipping. Expedited shipping methods will be charged at the normal rate. If you wish to return your wine, you will be refunded less a 15% restocking fee.

Packages still in transit may be redirected to a different address for an $18 redirect fee. By law, only the shipper may redirect wine shipments to a new address.

### Confirmation & Tracking

Once your package ships, you will receive an email confirmation with your tracking number. For most states, tracking numbers will be active when your wines ship. If you have further tracking questions, please email us at [customerservice@adairfamilywines.com](mailto:customerservice@adairfamilywines.com?subject=Shipping Page Inquiry) and include your order number for an update.

### 21+ Requirements

Both the buyer and recipient must be 21 years or older with verification during purchase and upon receipt. Regulatory compliance with state and federal law requires us to keep a valid identification number (driver's license, passport, or military identification number) or date of birth on file for you as proof of your legal age.

### Tax

Tax varies by address and will be calculated during checkout.

### Vintage Changes

Due to vintage changes in inventory, if an item in your order is no longer available, we will substitute it with next available vintage.
