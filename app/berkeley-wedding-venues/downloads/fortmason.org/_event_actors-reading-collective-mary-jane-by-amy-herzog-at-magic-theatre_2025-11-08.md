## Presented By Actors’ Reading Collective & Magic Theatre

The [Actors’ Reading Collective](https://www.arcstream.org/maryjane) (ARC) presents [ _Mary Jane_](https://www.arcstream.org/maryjane) By [Amy Herzog](https://www.drama.yale.edu/bios/amy-herzog-2) at Magic Theatre in Building D, Third Floor at Fort Mason Center For Arts and Culture. 

## MARY JANE FEATURES

The [Actors’ Reading Collective](https://www.arcstream.org/maryjane) (ARC) presents [ _Mary Jane_](https://www.arcstream.org/maryjane) By [Amy Herzog](https://www.drama.yale.edu/bios/amy-herzog-2) at Magic Theatre in Building D, Third Floor at Fort Mason Center For Arts and Culture. As  _Mary Jane_ navigates both the mundane and the unfathomable realities of caring for Alex, her chronically ill young son, she finds herself building a community of women from many walks of life.

Developing upon last year’s critically acclaimed production of  _The Antipodes_ , the Actors’ Reading Collective returns with its second fully staged production. Born of the pandemic lockdown, a group of actors gathered to read scripts together online. As theaters began to re-open, the collective realized they had created something special, and continued to present staged readings in person: script-in-hand, minimal production values, one-night-only performances. ARC’s first in-person staged reading was  _Mary Jane_ , in August 2022, as a benefit for the Parent Infant Program of UCSF’s Benioff Children’s Hospital, Oakland. Now, fresh from its celebrated Broadway run,  _Mary Jane_ comes to San Francisco.

San Francisco Bay Area-based director Amy Kossow says, “It is such a joy to bring Amy Herzog’s beautiful play to San Francisco.  _Mary Jane_ is based on the writer’s story as the mother of a medically fragile child. I, too, am the mother of a special needs child. This play reaches into the heart of my life and asks me to bring to bear all the truth I possess in creating a workspace full of heart and truth-telling skill, as this company of women create our  _Mary Jane_. I am so thrilled to work with this spectacular cast and am honored to be the first in-house ARC director to take an ARC show to full production.”’

Reprising the title role is ARC artist Lisa Morse, who portrayed  _Mary Jane_ in ARC’s 2022 staged reading. Lisa was recently seen in this summer’s ARC  _Outside the Box_ reading of  _The Best We Could_ , as well as touring her solo show,  _Mrs. Winchester, or, a Gun in the First Act_. Actor [Danielle Levin](https://daniellelevin.com/daniellelevin.com/Home.html) also returns to the cast of  _Mary Jane_ , recently seen in ARC’s  _Outside the Box_ reading of  _The Thin Place_. ARC Artist [Leontyne Mbele-Mbong](https://www.leontynembele-mbong.com/), who directed ARC’s  _Outside the Box_ reading of  _Appropriate_ , and performed in  _The Best We Could_ , rejoins the cast of  _Mary Jane_. Rounding out the cast is ARC Artist [Stacy Ross](https://www.stacyrossactor.com/), recently seen as Prospero in [ _The Tempest_](https://www.marinshakespeare.org/tempest) at Marin Shakespeare Company; and making her ARC debut is [Anna Takayo](https://www.instagram.com/annatakayo/?hl=en), recently seen in [ _Waste_](https://www.marintheatre.org/show-details/waste) at Marin Theatre.

Amy Herzog’s plays include  _After the Revolution_ (Lilly Award),  _4000 Miles_ (Obie Award – Best New American Play, Pulitzer Prize Finalist),  _The Great God Pan_ , and  _Belleville_ (Susan Smith Blackburn Prize Finalist; Drama Desk Nomination). Amy is a recipient of the Whiting Writers Award, the Benjamin H. Danks Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the Helen Merrill, the Joan and Joseph Cullman Award for Extraordinary Creativity, and the New York Times Outstanding Playwright Award. She has taught playwriting at Bryn Mawr and Yale.

ARC’s mission is to inspire and challenge audiences with captivating, language-centered, ensemble-based storytelling from a broad range of playwrights.
