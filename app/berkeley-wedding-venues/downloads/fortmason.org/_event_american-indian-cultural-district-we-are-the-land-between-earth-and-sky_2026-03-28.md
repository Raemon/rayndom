## _We Are the Land: Between Earth And Sky_

The [American Indian Cultural District](https://americanindianculturaldistrict.org/) (AICD), with support from Fort Mason Center For Arts & Culture (FMCAC), presents new mural commissions by artists [Brittany Burrows](https://BrittanyBurrowsArt.com) and [Jewelina Acosta](https://www.youtube.com/@jewelinaacosta7225).

## About the Installation

The [American Indian Cultural District](https://americanindianculturaldistrict.org/) (AICD), with support from Fort Mason Center For Arts & Culture (FMCAC), presents new mural commissions by artists [Brittany Burrows](https://BrittanyBurrowsArt.com) and [Jewelina Acosta](https://www.youtube.com/@jewelinaacosta7225). Depicting vegetation and wildlife from the land and water, the artists highlight the importance of Indigenous knowledge and traditional practices in maintaining ecological balance and human well-being. By recognizing the interconnectedness of all life forms and the importance of preserving biodiversity, their work points to a more harmonious and sustainable future for generations to come.

In  _We are the Land: Between Earth & Sky_, Brittany Burrows highlights the parallels between endangered butterfly species and the struggles of Indigenous communities. Both are deeply connected to the land and face threats to their survival due to various factors, including habitat loss, environmental degradation, and cultural assimilation.

_“Land stewardship and sovereignty are indeed crucial for preserving Indigenous ways of life and ensuring the continued thriving of both human and non-human communities. By respecting Indigenous rights to their ancestral lands and supporting their efforts in environmental conservation, we can learn valuable lessons about sustainable living and holistic interconnectedness,”_ said Burrows.
