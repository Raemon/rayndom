## ECHOES FEATURES

Museo Italo Americano presents “[Echoes](https://sfmuseo.org/exhibition/echoes)” at Fort Mason Center For Arts & Culture. This exhibit showcases photography by [Sharon D’Amico](https://www.damicophotography.com/index), paintings by [Lar Landa](https://www.larlanda.com/), and ink on paper works by [Nina Temple](https://ninatempleart.com/).

Experience the visual rhythms and layered perceptions of three distinct artists. Echoing through form and color, each work becomes a reverberation of memory, place, and emotion.

[Sharon F. D’Amico](https://www.damicophotography.com/index) captures compelling abstract photographs reflecting the ever-changing moods of sea and sky.

[Lar Landa](https://www.larlanda.com/) contributes expressive acrylic paintings that evoke the emotional undertones of color and form. [Nina Temple](https://ninatempleart.com/) creates delicate ink on paper works that embrace the spontaneity of fluid motion and the interplay between control and chance.

The exhibit is on view from Tuesday, June 24, 2025 through Sunday, October 12, 2025. Museo hours are Tuesday through Saturday, 12:00 p.m. (Noon) to 4:00 p.m. and Sunday, 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. (Closed on major holidays.)
