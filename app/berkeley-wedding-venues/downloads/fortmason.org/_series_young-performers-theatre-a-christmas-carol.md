## Young Performers Theatre: A Christmas Carol FEATURES

Fort Mason Center for Arts & Culture resident group [Young Performers Theatre](https://YPT.org) presents [ _A Christmas Carol_](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/a-christmas-carol-tickets-1809580316439) in the Southside Theater, Building D, Third Floor.

Adapted by Kate Gargiulo**,** the play runs December 6 to December 14, 2025: Saturday, December 6, 2:00 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m.; Sundays, December 7 and 14, 2:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m.; Friday, December 12, 7:00 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.; and Saturday, December 13, 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.

Audiences of all ages are invited to rediscover Charles Dickens’ classic holiday ghost story through the imagination and voices of San Francisco’s young performers. 

This is more than just a play – it’s a holiday gift of resilience, joy, and community spirit.  _A Christmas Carol_ is performed for kids by kids and is suitable for all ages.
