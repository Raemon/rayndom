## Landscapes in Bloom: Organic Blending FEATURES

Discover [Winsor & Newton watercolors](https://www.winsornewton.com/pages/watercolour) through FLAX Art & Design Store’s workshop at Fort Mason Center for Arts & Culture. Join artist [Ryan Martin](https://www.ryanmartinart.com/), for a “[Landscapes in Bloom: Organic Blending](http://flaxart.com/stores/workshops-events)” watercolor painting workshop with Winsor & Newton’s [Professional Watercolours](https://www.winsornewton.com/collections/professional-watercolour).

Suitable for both beginner and advanced painters, this project uses Winsor & Newton (W&N) Professional Watercolours to create a landscape using a watercolor bloom technique, a captivating method that offers artists a dynamic and spontaneous way to create unique textures and patterns. All materials are provided in the hands-on project brought to you by FLAX Art & Design Store and Winsor & Newton.

Techniques used in this project can be used with other subject matter to expand participants’ overall painting skills. This five-step project includes: Creating the Initial Drawing, Applying the Underpainting, Learning About Art Masking Fluid, Painting the Mountains, and Painting the Lake.
