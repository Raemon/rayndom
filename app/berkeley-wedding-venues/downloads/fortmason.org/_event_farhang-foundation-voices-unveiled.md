## VOICES UNVEILED FEATURES

[_VOICES UNVEILED_](https://ehsanmatoori.com/projects/voices-unveiled)**** is a bilingual, three-part concert composed and produced by internationally acclaimed Iranian musician [Ehsan Matoori](https://ehsanmatoori.com/). Featuring powerful performances by vocalists [Maliheh Moradi](http://malihehmoradi.com/) and [Mina Deris](https://soundcloud.com/minaderis), this evocative work gives voice to stories too often silenced – those of Iranian women navigating identity, oppression, resilience, and freedom.

Following more than 40 performances across North America and acclaim from more than 15,000 audience members,  _VOICES UNVEILED_ makes its highly anticipated San Francisco debut. The performance blends the soulful depth of traditional and folk Iranian music – particularly from southern Iran – with modern fusion elements that resonate globally.

The work has received international recognition, including the prestigious New Music USA 2023 Award, and continues to inspire audiences with its bold storytelling and emotional power.
