[_Snowed In: A Comedy_](https://app.gopassage.com/events/bats-improv-presents-snowed-in-feb-2026)appears on Saturdays, **February 7 and 14, 2026** , 8:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m., $15 to $25 ($16.59 to $27.12 with fees). Romance, rivalry, and a flurry of misunderstandings turn one cozy lodge into a blizzard of laughs.

[_House Of The Flying Bat: Improvised Kung Fu_](https://app.gopassage.com/events/bats-improv-presents-house-of-the-flying-bat-feb-2026) leaps into action on Saturdays, **February 21 and 28, 2026** , 8:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m., $15 to $25 ($16.59 to $27.12 with fees). Enter the mystical, made-up world of an ancient China where kung fu rules. Inspired by wuxia movies like  _House Of Flying Daggers_ and  _Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon_ , the BATS cast brings to life a fully improvised kung fu movie. Once a title from the audience is chosen, the fighting begins!

Part improv show and part reality show:  _The Saboteur_ asks audiences to identify the improviser who is an undercover secret agent working to undermine the show. It is not as easy as it seems … because the secret operative improv player must not get caught! From time to time the audience becomes detective, judge, and jury – it’s their chance to guess their identity. Unmask The Saboteur before it’s too late!

Witness the magic ignite as Scheherazade weaves unforeseen tales to enthrall King Shahrayar!  _Improvised Arabian Nights_ whisks audiences away on a spellbinding journey, where brand-new chapters unfold in this legendary saga. BATS talented improvisers draw inspiration from the timeless themes of the  _Arabian Nights_ , crafting enchanting narratives brimming with mystical magic, unpredictable mayhem, cunning thieves, valiant heroes, powerful djinns, and boundless love that conquers all.
