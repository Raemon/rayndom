## EVENT DETAILS

For more than a decade, Moghadam has developed a practice that transforms photography into sculptural forms and site-specific installations. Her work layers images, textures, and materials to create environments that honor courage, bear witness, and amplify voices often suppressed under surveillance and oppression. Across the gallery, photographs become physical and conceptual gestures, prompting reflection on what it means to see – and to be seen – when power seeks to erase presence.

“In  _And Yet, We See_ , Nasim Moghadam’s photography transforms images into acts of witnessing,” says curator [Zoë Latzer](https://www.instagram.com/zoelatzer). “Her work makes visible what power seeks to erase and invites us to confront the agency, courage, and resilience of those who are often made invisible.”

_And Yet, We See_ transforms the gallery into a space of witness, reflection, and engagement, offering audiences the opportunity to experience photography as both image and immersive encounter.

## About the Artist
