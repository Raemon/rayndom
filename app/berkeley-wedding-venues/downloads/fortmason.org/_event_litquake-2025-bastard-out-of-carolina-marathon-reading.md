## Litquake 2025: Bastard Out Of Carolina Marathon Reading FEATURES

[Litquake](https://litquake2025.sched.com/event/28hLu/bastard-out-of-carolina-marathon-reading) pays tribute to the late, great Dorothy Allison with a marathon reading of her debut novel, [ _Bastard Out Of Carolina_](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/297592/bastard-out-of-carolina-by-dorothy-allison), at Arion Press in Building B, First Floor, at Fort Mason Center For Arts & Culture. The reading takes place on Sunday, October 12, 2025, 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.

Dorothy Allison’s debut novel  _Bastard Out of Carolina_ was a revelation on its release: a blazing, unflinching, thoroughly original tale grounded in the author’s working-class Southern upbringing and written with her distinctive, razor-sharp wit. Lauded by the  _New York Times Book Review_ as “one of those once-in-a-blue-moon occasions when the jacket copy seems inadequate and all the blurbs are examples of rhetorical understatement,” _Bastard Out of Carolina_ remains a powerful, provocative, and lyrically gorgeous fixture of American letters more than 30 years after its release.

In remembrance of Allison’s legacy as a writer, lesbian feminist, and advocate for sexual freedom, Litquake is proud to join the author’s estate in presenting a cover-to-cover marathon reading of  _Bastard_ featuring a lineup of readers who knew and loved Allison in life, as well as those who continue drawing inspiration from her trailblazing work. Select chapters are staged by [Crowded Fire Theater](https://www.crowdedfire.org/), [Poltergeist Theatre Project](https://www.instagram.com/poltergeist_theatre_project), and [Word for Word](https://www.zspace.org/aboutwordforword). Artistic direction is handled by [Sean Owens](https://www.instagram.com/seanowensplaywright) and Hyazinth Baumann from [Fancypants Productions.](https://fancypantssf.com/)

Book sales for this event are coordinated by [Noe Valley Books](https://noevalleybooks.com/).

Free Admission ($10 to $15 suggested donation)
