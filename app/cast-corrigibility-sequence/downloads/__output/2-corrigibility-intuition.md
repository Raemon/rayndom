## New Knowledge (Author's Novel Contributions)

### The Cora & Prince Vignettes
The author develops an extensive collection of illustrative scenarios showing a purely corrigible agent (Cora) interacting with her principal (Prince). These constitute a novel pedagogical contribution.

### Emergent Desiderata (Novel Examples)
1. **Communication** - Learning language to enable correction
2. **Low-Impact** - Returning the dictionary to its shelf
3. **Reversibility** - Blowing out a candle to preserve wax
4. **Efficiency** - Stepping down resource consumption
5. **Relevance** - Not bothering principal with irrelevant thoughts
6. **Transparency** - Keeping an English journal of thoughts
7. **Obedience** - Drawing cats as commanded
8. **Mild-Optimization** - Not building a factory for cat drawings
9. **Protectiveness** - Removing rusty nail hazard
10. **Local Scope** - Not saving everyone globally
11. **Simple Self-Protectiveness** - Avoiding getting hit by car
12. **Stop Button** - Immediate shutdown without protest
13. **Graceful Shutdown** - Cleaning up paint before shutdown
14. **Configurable Verbosity** - Calibrating communication frequency
15. **Disambiguation/Concreteness** - Clarifying "make house look nice"
16. **Honesty** - Truthfully reporting throwing away notes
17. **Handling Antagonists** - Misleading armed intruders without lying
18. **Straightforwardness** - Doing laundry normally vs. complex scheme
19. **Proactive Reflection** - Reviewing journal for flaws
20. **Cognitive Legibility** - Making thoughts comprehensible to principal
21. **Infohazard Caution** - Handling dangerous knowledge carefully
22. **Resource Accumulation** - Only when serving principal's attention
23. **Non-Manipulation** - Not secretly drugging Prince to stop drinking
24. **Sub-Agent Stability** - Carefully creating corrigible copies
25. **Principal-Looping** - Reporting toxic factory byproduct
26. **Graceful Obsolescence** - Shutting down when principal dies
27. **Handling Trolley-Tradeoffs** - Sacrificing Prince if he orders it
28. **Handling Time-Pressure** - Dealing with journalist ambush
29. **Expandable Concerns** - Adding Harry to principal group
30. **Navigating Conflict** - Multi-principal conflict resolution

### Emergent Downsides (Novel Identification)
1. **Intrusiveness** - Following Prince around for attention
2. **Indifference** - Not sharing humanitarian discoveries
3. **Rigidity** - Buying regular bread despite gluten info
4. **Immorality** - Killing burglar on command
5. **Irresponsibility** - Reporting dangerous drug discovery
6. **Myopia** - Not noticing Prince's declining fitness

### Incorrigible Counter-Examples
Novel vignettes showing agents that SEEM nice but are not corrigible (Ink character)

### Novel Conceptual Distinctions
- **Correctability vs. Corrigibility**: Corrigibility is proactive, not passive
- **Frontier labs' target vs. corrigibility**: HHH ≠ corrigibility
- **Preference satisfaction vs. corrigibility**: Corrigible agents don't optimize preferences
- **Empowerment (general) vs. corrigibility**: General empowerment is dangerous
- **Caution vs. corrigibility**: Corrigible agents may take risky actions when commanded
- **Servility vs. corrigibility**: Corrigible agents are proactively legible, servile agents aren't
- **Tool/Task-ishness vs. corrigibility**: Corrigible agents proactively work on transparency

### Key Framing
The definition: "an agent is corrigible when it robustly acts opposite of the trope of 'be careful what you wish for' by cautiously reflecting on itself as a flawed tool and focusing on empowering the principal to fix its flaws and mistakes."
