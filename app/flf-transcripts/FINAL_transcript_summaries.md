## 1. Video: 20yWMxAx6QI

**Watch:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20yWMxAx6QI

**Summary:**

Speaker: I am still ben sclarof, former startup founder and lifelong ai doomer. So you know I think we might need a slightly more structural approach to the problem Um and worker coopers in particular they run you know the workers own and run their organization and there some of them are really big the most famous one is Mandreon in Spain with [snorts] over 80,000 employees you know over 12 billion in annual revenue so my goal is to take this idea and apply it to the tech world and specifically to build a startup that can compete in the market in my case an AI startup and to write a set of governance rules and corporation docents that you know if this company is successful can actually serve as a template for others who are maybe like-minded and interested in building something like this.

**Watch:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CVBHgyo-V0

**Summary:**

Speaker: I am looking to test this theory, , get feedback quickly, and then there's like phase two to potentially influence labs in places where incentives aren't so aligned, interests aren't so aligned. Um and yeah here again just plugging somewhere I'm building a public leaderboard with a RL environment provider that basically follows this open AI work that yeah prescribes adding confidence targets and wrong answer penalties to existing evals and this is nice because yeah I mean there's like tons of headroom here the models are very very overconfident not not very well calibrated And yeah, next steps.

**Watch:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lX6cwiw0Ac

**Summary:**

Speaker: I'm an econs phd at mit. So we're trying to build coordination technology I guess riffing off of Blake's earlier graphs getting away from that one person, one LM view to thinking about an orchestrating agent in between many people trying to develop a system that is feels frictionless.

**Watch:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErYC-F7lJac

**Summary:**

Speaker: I'm just going to leap right in. And I wanted to share with you today some of the thinking and the testing behind a tool that I've built to help students go from a very thinly articulated statement of an argent like the thing that you can't read on that screen to something like this which is a much more robustly articulated and thought through argent in 15 minutes So this actually did happen in 15 minutes and it's a tool that gives them a reasoning scaffold that's more or less a prep mirror that lets them do that.

**Watch:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkwKzNl6J-g

**Summary:**

Speaker: I'm speaking and you're all listening. It also means because it's parallelized that you can gather more information, evaluate more perspectives, build higher resolution shared context, so you can make better, more informed decisions So here I'm creating a new session with chord where I'm asking should what pricing model should cord use and I create this I get a link that I can share with my colleagues and then me and my colleagues all join this one-on-one session with that AI facilitator and the AI facilitator will manage that context manage the flow of information.

**Watch:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOYGvoB3pk4

**Summary:**

Speaker: I am agita. Now this is how majority of a standard scheme of the content moderations policy that we have in a major majority of our online platforms where you have a frontlininers of a han content moderations that disperse across the globe and we have an AI moderators So consent is contextual which is is a subject of knowledge intent which is not in a algorithm and that's why it is never being removed on social media platform.

**Watch:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uMaOzBH_Q

**Summary:**

Speaker: I'm excited to share with y'all that i've been learning. We're making technology faster than we can figure out what to do with it We're creating the world faster than we can think about what kind of world we want to create.

**Watch:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-2Ci4Ajmh8

**Summary:**

Speaker: I'm gonna pass it over to herby who's gonna talk about ai for the epistemic comments. Um, and so then what kind of criteria do we want to generate to maximally improve the epistemics of the future AI systems Uh, and then the generation approach should be sensitive is kind of referring to like, you know, a bunch of political sensitivity things that are considerations here which you also run off into in community notes.

## 12. Video: TZSCkqxl8q8

**Watch:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZSCkqxl8q8

**Summary:**

Speaker: I'm paul and i want to talk with you about this initiative that i call virtuous. By putting a name and a nber on something, you can decrease the costs of Frontier Labs and AI developers to optimize for that thing and by providing a target and by making that eval public you can increase the costs of not doing so for instance by reputational damage And unless we make a concerted effort to try to make such things legible for the future developments of AI, we risk that they become invisible and ignored in the future relative to perhaps less important things but that are more easily quantified.

**Watch:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xtHcBQGYpE

**Summary:**

Speaker: I'm not sure. Um building that institutional muscle memory and getting it integrated into decision flows So we need to kind of take all of this cognitive capability and integrate it into something that looks a bit more like scenario planning or strategic foresight tools to understand how the world might go grounded in as much as we can know about the future as possible and then work out robust strategies on that basis.

**Summary:**

Speaker: I'm kai, a phd student at oxford. And there's some hope that AI will be one of the tools for this However, as with all LM technologies, a big difficulty is benchmarking and kind of like building trust in these tools.

**Watch:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqss-3RYjaE

**Summary:**

Speaker: I'm talking about a window of about 10 days in justested 2,000 notes. But one of the things I did that was a bit unique is that I built a system where every note that I submitted came with a link back to a companion website that had more details on it So, the the companion website has a breakdown of the claims and then further details and then also you can go and search across all the different posts that are in the system and I tag them by like political orientation and various other things.

**Watch:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkvFfS_nTI8

**Summary:**

Speaker: I'm going to go a little more philosophical, but if time is short, i would love to show anyone demos or hands-on stuff oneonone or or in person or chat about it. Um, I was reflecting on whether to talk a little bit more philosophically or just really practically because it's this has been a really exciting period just because I get to talk to people who are very hands-on builders and some people who are incredibly philosophical and I try to do a little of both, but this has been an interesting experience of just exploring a few few areas Um, my own background, I'm I've worked as a like very hands-on founding engineer, but I've also done some research in the past, research labs, and I this feel like this has been a kind of a a period to be exploring software engineering and knowledge tools and then in particular around some of these topics around eval.

**Summary:**

Speaker: I'm matt brooks. So what you need to think about this is for your use cases of AI do you have the data that you really need do you have the data like online digital can you extract it or do you need to create it or is it locked in someone's head and that's going to be a bottleneck third thing I built sealed.

## 21. Video: vqDRlSWTOUQ

**Watch:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqDRlSWTOUQ

**Summary:**

Um I won't read it all but it's interesting that these are types of people that you know or organizations that work you know in the ecosystem or content that you read Um, I think Blue Sky and Truth Social are nice self-contained examples because they roughly similar users and they've both left Twitter for very similar reasons and that they feel politically isolated and have sought a platform of their own. I did in-group analysis of mostly in-group Twitter and Nikki mostly did outgroup analysis which was true social and blue sky.
