## Code of Conduct

At Abbey Pet Hospital, we strive to provide a welcoming and safe environment which ensures trust and respect for all people and pets.

**We have a zero-tolerance policy for the following behavior:**

  1.      1. Verbal abuse, malicious or harmful statements, profanity or disrespect directed at any person or pet;
     2. Any form of harassment;
     3. Discriminatory comments and/or actions;
     4. Intimidation tactics and/or threats;
     5. Allowing your pet to intimidate or threaten a person or another pet;
     6. Public disclosure of another’s private information;
     7. Failure to comply with requests from our staff, including leashing/restraining your pet;
     8. Unrealistic expectations of care despite being informed of our availability and ability to care for your pet;
     9. Insinuating that any member of our team doesn’t care about your pet or values financial gain over your pet’s health/safety. We will always offer the best quality medicine for the situation.



**In the event that your behavior is problematic, we reserve the right to discontinue services****immediately.**

This policy is strictly enforced. Non-compliance will result in corrective measures, which may include termination of veterinary care at Abbey Pet Hospital, being asked to leave the property and/or the involvement of law enforcement.
