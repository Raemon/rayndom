# Pet Diagnostics

Early detection of any disease is vital when treating it. This is why we recommend routine wellness exams and bloodwork for our clients.

Blood work and urinalysis are used for various reasons, including diagnosing disease and assessing your pet’s health. Tests will assess your pet’s organ functions and provide a better picture of their general health, including any issues that may go undetected during a physical examination. When your pet is healthy, obtaining baseline bloodwork and taking a urine sample allows you to compare results. Regular testing also helps spot potential problems before they become serious by enabling you to monitor changes over time.

Bloodwork is used to detect a variety of illnesses. We utilize IDEXX laboratories both with in-house machines as well as their reference lab in Sacramento.
