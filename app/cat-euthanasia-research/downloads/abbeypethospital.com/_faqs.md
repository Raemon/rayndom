# Abbey Pet Hospital FAQs

## Your pet’s health is important.

At [Abbey Pet Hospital](https://abbeypethospital.com/about-abbey-pet-hospital/), we get a ton of interesting questions from pet parents. Below are some common FAQs that might help answer any questions or concerns. Please feel free to call us at [510-233-1003](tel:510-233-1003) for any other concerns you might have about your pet.

##### Do I need an appointment?

Yes, we see patients by appointment only and do not offer walk-in services. Please [call](tel:510-233-1003) to schedule an appointment asap as we often book out several days or more.

##### Can I accompany my pet for the exam?

During the COVID-19 pandemic, safety protocols will change as needed. Please see the drop-down menu at the top of this page for current procedures.

##### Are you accepting New Clients?

Yes, we are currently accepting New Clients! However, we limit the number of new client appointments per day and are now booked out for 1-2 months. If you’d like to become a client of [Abbey Pet Hospital](https://abbeypethospital.com/about-abbey-pet-hospital/), please select the appropriate option in the widget in the bottom right corner of this page.

##### My pet is healthy but needs vaccine boosters, do I need to schedule a doctor’s exam?

If your pet is (1) healthy, (2) has had an examination with one of our excellent [APH veterinarians](https://abbeypethospital.com/veterinarian-el-cerrito-ca/) within the past 12 months, and (3) you have no concerns to discuss with the doctor, you are more than welcome to schedule a technician appointment for this service. Tech appointments can be scheduled for nail trims, anal gland expressions, and vaccines as long as the pet’s examination is current. If your pet is not healthy or you have concerns that you’d like to discuss with the doctor, you’ll need to schedule an exam so the doctor can determine whether vaccines are safe to administer. A doctor’s exam and tech appointment can be scheduled via the widget in the bottom right corner of this page.

##### What is your policy for cancellations, missed appointments, and/or late arrivals?

At Abbey Pet Hospital, we pride ourselves in offering personalized care and reserve appointment times to accommodate your pet’s needs. Late arrivals, missed appointments or cancelled appointments without sufficient notice, create a gap in our doctors’ schedule. These are appointments that could have been utilized to offer care to another patient.

**_  
Late Arrivals:_**

When a patient arrives late, the time spent with the patient is minimized and does not allow for a full assessment. It also disrupts the schedules of our doctors and other patients. At Abbey Pet Hospital, patients who arrive more than 10 minutes late for a scheduled appointment will be rescheduled. Alternatively, with doctor approval, you may be offered an overflow appointment at an increased cost. This would require an extended wait time but offers you the convenience of having your pet seen the same day as your missed appointment.

**_Last Minute Cancellations and Missed Appointments:_**

We kindly request a 24-hour notice on all cancellations. As a courtesy to our clients, we try to confirm all appointments. We do recognize that situations arise that are out of your control; however, it is imperative that you contact our office immediately to notify us of your cancellation in a timely manner. Appointments repeatedly cancelled are not appreciated. If it is your first time cancelling with less than a 24-hour notice or missing an appointment with our office, there will be no charge. We reserve the right to require a non-refundable deposit of $40 for all future appointments for repeated cancellations or no-shows.

_We ask for your consideration and cooperation in scheduling your next appointment. Please understand that we are partners in your pet’s health care, and we are committed to offering your pet appropriate care when needed._

##### Do you see emergencies?

We can handle most emergencies during regular business hours; however, we have limits on what we can do based on staffing and current demand. [Call us](tel:510-233-1003) before you come, and we will do our best to take care of your pet as quickly as possible. After hours, please get in touch with one of our local [emergency hospitals](https://www.petsreferralcenter.com/).

##### Can you care for rabbits, birds, rodents, reptiles, cattle, rhinoceroses, or any other exotic pets?

Unfortunately, we only see cats and dogs at this time.

##### I brought my pet to your hospital for its spay/neuter through The Milo Foundation (or another awesome rescue we work with), am I still considered a new client?

Yes. We are bound by the [Veterinary](https://abbeypethospital.com/veterinarian-el-cerrito-ca/)-Client-Patient relationship. At the time of your pet’s [procedure](https://abbeypethospital.com/pet-surgery-el-cerrito/), our relationship was with the rescue the procedure was scheduled under. Please fill out a new client form via the widget on this page, including your pet’s Milo ID# for reference.

##### COVID-19 Update: Click here for current protocols.

**To our Abbey Pet Hospital family:**

We hope that all of you and your families remain in good health and spirits. The health and well-being of your pets have and will always be what drives us each day. Amid the ever-changing concerns and safety recommendations surrounding COVID-19, we will regularly update our current protocols here.

****OUR LOBBY IS OPEN****  
 **Masks are appreciated but no longer required. Curbside optional if preferred.**

Check-in Process:

  * **Please arrive on time for your appointment.** If you check-in more than 10 minutes after your scheduled appointment time, we may need to reschedule your appointment.
  * When you arrive for your appointment, COME ON IN! If curbside is preferred, please text us your pet’s information and stall number when you arrive.



Exam Process:

  * Option 1 – In-person exam:
    * Shortly after check-in, a technician will escort you and your pet into the exam room.
    * Once inside, they will take your pet’s weight/temp and ask brief intake questions.
    * The veterinarian will come in for the physical exam.
    * If any treatment or diagnostics are needed, the technicians will bring your pet to the treatment area or ask you to exit the room while these are performed in order to optimize social distancing.
  * Option 2 – Curbside:
    * Please wait outside/in your car for the duration of your pet’s appointment.
    * A technician will call you for information about your pet’s reason for visit. It is recommended to bring a written list of your concerns to maximize the time you have with the doctor.
    * The technician will meet you outside of your car to retrieve your pet and bring him/her into the hospital for the doctor’s exam.
    * The veterinarian will come outside to discuss his/her examination findings and recommended treatment plan.



We ask if you or anyone in your family is **not feeling well** or may have been recently exposed to anyone with symptoms, please call to reschedule your appointment as soon as possible.

    * If absolutely necessary, feel free to ask a symptom-free friend or family member to bring your pet in for you. Kindly let us know if this is the case; we will see what arrangements can be made so as to protect the rest of our clients and staff.



We appreciate your patience as we navigate the ‘new normal’ and want you to know that the safety and wellbeing of you, your pets, and our staff continue to be Abbey Pet Hospital’s top priority.

##### What are my payment options?

All major credit cards, cash, checks, [**CareCredit**](https://www.carecredit.com/apply/), and [**ScratchPay**](https://scratchpay.com/).

##### Can I make payments?

Payment is required in full at the time of service. For those interested in financing solutions, we accept both Scratchpay and Care Credit as alternative forms of payment. Please find more information below to determine if either, or both, will work for you.

  * Scratchpay is not a credit card; it’s a short-term loan/payment plan. Checking your plan option will not affect your credit score. You can find more information on it [**here**](https://scratchpay.com/).
  * CareCredit is a credit card that offers healthcare financing. This card offers 0% APR for 6 months on charges over $200. Since this is a credit card, however, it will be a hard inquiry on your credit. Clients often use Care Credit for their own healthcare services (including their personal dental care) as well. More information can be found on their website [**here**](https://www.carecredit.com/apply/).



##### I have pet insurance, do I still need to pay?

Yes. Pet insurance is a great option to make caring for your pet affordable and ensure that they receive the care they need when they need it. Unfortunately, pet insurance does not work the same as human health insurance. With most pet insurance plans, you pay the [veterinarian](https://abbeypethospital.com/veterinarian-el-cerrito-ca/) upfront and are reimbursed by your insurance provider after filing a claim.

##### I’d like to get insurance for my pet, which company do you recommend?

Great question! There are a TON of pet insurance companies that provide plans based on many factors. Since we have little to no interaction with pet insurance companies, we’re going to defer to the professionals for this one. To instantly compare personalized recommendations of various pet insurance plans across top providers, visit [Pawlicy Advisor.](https://www.pawlicy.com/advice)

##### I have questions about my pets upcoming procedure, who should I ask?

Our [doctors](https://abbeypethospital.com/veterinarian-el-cerrito-ca/) and surgical technicians are more than happy to address any questions or concerns before, during, and following your pet’s procedure. Feel free to contact us via text, email, or phone.

##### I have other questions, how do I get in contact with someone?

Feel free to contact us via text, email, or phone. If you have concerns about your pet, please schedule an examination with one of our stellar [veterinarians](https://abbeypethospital.com/veterinarian-el-cerrito-ca/) via the widget in the bottom right corner of this screen.
