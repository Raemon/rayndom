### Matthew Judd, DVM

_Owner/Medical Director_

Dr. Matt Judd joined Abbey Pet Hospital in 2011 and became the business owner in 2016 after the beloved Dr. Lee Prutton retired.

After graduating from Ohio State College of Veterinary Medicine in 2007, Dr. Judd began his veterinary career working in Placerville, CA. After a few years of mixed animal practice, he moved to the Bay Area to focus on dogs and cats. His clinical interests are medicine, general surgery, and dentistry.

Dr. Judd lives in Kensington and enjoys spending time with his brilliant wife, Dr. Anne Hitchcock, two super-smart kids, one kind of intelligent dog, and two cats (one is smart, the other is all looks). In his free time, he enjoys mountain biking. His favorite places to ride are Tilden Park and the backside of China Camp.

### Gretel Schlegel, DVM

_Associate Veterinarian_

Dr. Gretel Schlegel joined Abbey Pet Hospital in 2017 after moving from Fond Du Lac, WI.

Dr. Schlegel is originally from Minnesota, where she graduated from veterinary school in 2011. In Wisconsin, she worked at a mixed animal practice where she saw dogs, cats, cows, sheep, goats, and alpacas. Dr. Schlegel especially enjoys working with older cats and addressing their particular needs.

​She has two spoiled cats of her own, Agador and Sassafras. Gretel enjoys hiking, learning native plants, baking, and spending time with her husband and cats.

### Jennie Kim, VMD

_Associate Veterinarian​_

​Dr. Jennie Kim joined the APH team in 2018. She originally hails from the Midwest and was born and raised in the Chicago area. She attended college at Yale University and graduated with a degree in Economics in 2002. After graduation, she enrolled in a post-baccalaureate program at the University of Pennsylvania and graduated from their veterinary school in 2008. She completed a rigorous internship at a busy emergency and referral practice in Brooklyn, NY. After several years of practice as an emergency veterinarian, she transitioned into general practice. Her veterinary interests include emergency medicine, wound care, and feline medicine. Outside of work, Jennie enjoys spending time with her family, eating, and running.

### Anne Hitchcock, DVM

_Associate Veterinarian_

Dr. Anne Hitchcock joined our team in 2021. She originally hails from Encinitas, CA, and attended UC Davis for both her bachelor’s and veterinary degrees. After veterinary college, she completed two one-year internships at Rood and Riddle Equine Hospital in Lexington, Kentucky, and The Ohio State University. After her internships, she became an associate veterinarian at Loomis Basin Equine Medical Center. In 2011 she switched her focus to small animal practice and remained focused on dogs and cats. Before joining Abbey, she worked at Animal Care Clinic in El Sobrante. Her main interests are in canine and feline medicine. She and Dr. Matt Judd have two children, two cats, and one dog.
