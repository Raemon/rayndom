###### We love our community

# Pet Rescue Partnerships

## Thank you for your interest in these amazing organizations.

The Milo Foundation is an established 501(c)(3) non-profit, no-kill rescue organization providing a second chance for homeless pets. We rescue dogs and cats from high-kill animal shelters and adopt them to loving homes best suited to provide lifetime care. We offer sanctuary to those pets that are not ready for adoption and educate the public about responsible pet guardianship, including SPAYING AND NEUTERING, here at [Abbey Pet Hospital](https://abbeypethospital.com/about-abbey-pet-hospital/)!

Milo adopts out approximately 1,800 dogs, puppies, cats, and kittens each year! We could not do this without our dedicated staff, generous donors, volunteers, foster homes, and you! Milo Point Richmond is open every day except Tuesday, from 11:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Come ADOPT!

NorCal Boxer Rescue is a foster-based, volunteer-run organization whose mission is to rescue homeless boxer dogs, provide them the care they need, and adopt them into loving forever homes. We serve all of northern California, from about Bakersfield north. As an organization committed to the no-kill movement, we recognize our responsibility as a breed rescue to serve the most vulnerable boxers — namely, those who are most at-risk in a shelter environment. These include dogs who have medical issues, are senior, or require behavioral intervention. 

We are grateful to [Abbey Pet Hospital](https://abbeypethospital.com/about-abbey-pet-hospital/) for providing excellent care to many of our dogs who are on their path to a forever home! If you are interested in supporting our efforts, joining our family of volunteers, or adopting a boxer, check out our website at [ncbr.org](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__ncbr.org_&d=DwMFaQ&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=A4ZnROLBTycUViPAj462z6Is_d0ZIJYartUTFmc8yik&m=6RnUT-6UM_GhiVdIa2ivSPsOljOdWrJZnU_ly24c1kQ&s=QSA6kG2ffP9sHP8YTUV2kAW4h-7xq8OGCgy_Q9Par7Q&e=)!
