# Pet Surgery

We have a dedicated surgery suite with the most up-to-date equipment to do almost any surgical operation. Our [veterinarians](https://abbeypethospital.com/veterinarian-el-cerrito-ca/) are well-versed in a wide range of surgical procedures, including spays and neuters, enterotomies and gastrotomies, cystotomies, splenectomies, tumor removals, TPLO, and more.

Our patients are always accompanied by a dedicated surgical technician for every surgical procedure. This highly trained veterinary technician monitors your pet’s health while under anesthesia.

The attention doesn’t stop when the operation is finished! After surgery, a dedicated recovery assistant will be at their side continuously until they are completely awake. Our recovery technician will send you a message informing you that your pet’s procedure is completed and what time they can return home.
