# Pet Wellness Care

From the first time you come in and throughout their entire life, the [Abbey Pet Hospital](https://abbeypethospital.com/about-abbey-pet-hospital/) team will be there to give your pet the finest care possible. In terms of what your pet can accomplish and how long they will live full, we believe that our pet preventive health care measures may maximize the length of that life. Every six months, we encourage examinations because many illness situations might develop rapidly. We’ll select which blood and urine tests are appropriate for your pet’s age while also clarifying when extra testing like blood pressure measurement, x-rays, or feces analysis is required.

**These visits include:**

Annual physical exams

We recommend annual physicals for patients of all life stages but may recommend more frequent exams if your pet’s health requires it. We will discuss diagnostics as appropriate for your pet.

Vaccinations

Our [veterinarians](https://abbeypethospital.com/veterinarian-el-cerrito-ca/) will collaborate with you to establish a comprehensive immunization program to safeguard your pet.

Dental exams

Your [veterinarian](https://abbeypethospital.com/veterinarian-el-cerrito-ca/) will evaluate your pet’s [dental health](https://abbeypethospital.com/pet-dental-care-el-cerrito/) and offer advice at your annual checkup. Pets, like people, require regular dental care both at home and at the veterinary clinic. According to the American Veterinary Dental Society, 70% of adult cats and 80% of adult dogs are afflicted with oral disease.

Parasite prevention

We’re here to shield your pet from fleas, ticks, and heartworms. We’ll collaborate with you to create the finest flea and tick prevention program for your pets.

Nutrition

Nutrition is an essential aspect of your pet’s health and well-being. Your pet’s nutritional needs vary with age and level of activity. Some medical issues can be managed with specially developed diets. We stock a variety of Royal Canin Veterinary diets in-hospital for your convenience.
