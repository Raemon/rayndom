# About Abbey Pet Hospital

## The Abbey Pet Hospital Story

Abbey Pet Hospital has been an independent, locally-owned business since it was founded in 1958 by Dr. Linton. Before Dr. Linton, the business was run as a pet grooming salon. Abbey Pet Hospital moved to its present location in the 1970s when Dr. Linton needed more space. In 1983, Dr. Lee Prutton purchased Abbey Pet Hospital; he then built the practice from a small one-doctor operation into a three-doctor hospital and boarding facility. Dr. Judd joined the practice in 2011 and purchased the business upon Dr. Prutton’s retirement in January 2016.

Our [four-doctor](https://abbeypethospital.com/veterinarian-el-cerrito-ca/) practice is big enough to provide a range of services but small enough to offer personalized care. We offer everything from routine [wellness visits](https://abbeypethospital.com/pet-wellness-care-el-cerrito/) and vaccines to advanced medicine and orthopedic [surgery](https://abbeypethospital.com/pet-surgery-el-cerrito/). Our doctors are general practitioners with years of experience in [wellness](https://abbeypethospital.com/pet-wellness-care-el-cerrito/), medicine, [surgery](https://abbeypethospital.com/pet-surgery-el-cerrito/), and [dentistry](https://abbeypethospital.com/pet-dental-care-el-cerrito/).

Our facility continues to improve and evolve, with renovations completed in 2018 and another round of improvements slated for completion in late 2022. What once was a tiny office hidden behind a pizza joint is now a vibrant and modern pet clinic serving a growing pet population. Our doctors and managers continue to grow and update our standards as veterinary medicine advances while maintaining a grounded and caring atmosphere.

We could not do it without the care and support of our community, so thank you for supporting us over the years, and we look forward to continuing to serve and connect for years to come.
