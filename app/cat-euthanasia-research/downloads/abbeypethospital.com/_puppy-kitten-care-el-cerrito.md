# Puppy and Kitten Care

Bringing home a new puppy or kitten is an exciting moment for your family. The [Abbey Pet Hospital staff](https://abbeypethospital.com/veterinarian-el-cerrito-ca/) may aid you in getting started with your new puppy or kitten on the right paw! Congrats on the latest addition to your family!

**What to expect during their first visit**

Set up your pet’s first visit with us as soon after adoption as possible. It is critical to get your new puppy or kitten adequately vaccinated and checked to ensure that it is healthy and ready to stay that way. We’ll create a personalized care plan, including vaccinations and maintenance recommendations based on your needs.

**Vaccinations are essential**

It is critical to protect their fragile bodies from the most prevalent diseases by administering vaccinations and following a timetable for puppies and kittens.

**Parasite prevention is a must**

Many things can carry internal parasite eggs, and puppies and kittens eat or sniff at them. It’s critical to check your puppy or kitten for intestinal worms and give appropriate medications as prescribed.

**We highly recommend spaying and neutering**

We typically recommend [spaying](https://abbeypethospital.com/pet-surgery-el-cerrito/) or [neutering](https://abbeypethospital.com/pet-surgery-el-cerrito/) pets to avoid unwanted pregnancies and reduce the risk of other health problems. Spaying or neutering your kitten by 5 months of age is advised. For dogs, we typically recommend spaying or neutering between 6-12 months, but this can vary based on breed and size. Our [veterinarians](https://abbeypethospital.com/veterinarian-el-cerrito-ca/) will talk with you about when it’s appropriate to spay or neuter your pet based on their circumstances.
