###### Testimonials

## [Your Kind Words](https://abbeypethospital.com/veterinarian-el-cerrito-ca-reviews/)

“If there were 6 stars, that’s what I’d give Abbey Pet Hospital and most especially Dr Jennie Kim. The staff is wonderful too – helpful, friendly and very very caring. Dr Kim quite literally saved our beloved dogs life. We thought we were going to lose our darling cane corso pit mix, Othello to leptospirosis. But Dr Kim wouldn’t have it – it took a month but with her tenacity Othello now has a clean bill of health. My husband and I are so very grateful. Oh, and I forgot to say, Othello loves going to Abbey Pet Hospital now and he adores Dr Kim. We couldn’t be happier.”

###### Jerome S.

“They have been taking very good care of my kitties. I’ve had a lot of emergencies with my challenging (risk-taking) 2 year old female cat. She’s already had one surgery (dog bite) and is scheduled for another procedure. They are incredibly responsive, caring and professional!”

###### Mirko Y.

“I had to say goodbye to my boy this weekend and the Abbey team was amazing, amazing, amazing. Always patient, kind and helpful. The place could be packed but they have a way of making you feel like your the only one there. Attentive and friendly!” 

###### April T.

“The vets are very good and compassionate. The front office staff is friendly. I’m so impressed with their COVID safety measures.” 

###### Maria C.

“Aweome people and the owner is so friendly and very easy going. He makes you feel comfortable to leave your pet under his care and expertise. I highly recommend him.”
