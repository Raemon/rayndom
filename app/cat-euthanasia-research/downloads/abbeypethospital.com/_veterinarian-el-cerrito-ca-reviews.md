Dr. Gretel Schlegel is the only vet I bring my cats to. She is incredibly kind and attentive but most importantly she actually listens to my concerns. I have had many vets say they think they have a diagnosis before I finish describing the symptoms. Dr. Schlegel always listens fully and gives the cats a thorough inspection before giving a diagnosis. Also, my cats can be afraid/suspicious of new people but warm to her quickly which makes the whole process less frightening for them.

I love Abbey Pet Hospital for my cat Joey. My cat has been suffering from an infection in his paws for a long time and before I found this wonderful hospital I took him to another pet hospital in the city which I was very disappointed with their treatment. Dr. Jennie Kim is the best and was especially nice and did not rush us through and really helped with the treatment. Thanks to Dr. Kim my cat is fully recovered and such a happy boy.

The staff was very attentive and informative. We absolutely loved our visit and they were so kind to my dog. We will be coming back.

The vets are very good and compassionate. The front office staff is friendly. I’m so impressed with their COVID safety measures.

Everyone here is super sweet and will help in any way they can. Both Dr. Schlegel and Dr. Judd-as well as all of the reception and lab teams-are very caring, attentive, and knowledgeable!! Thank you all!!

They have taken excellent care of my dog Scooby ever since we got him from the Milo foundation. They are efficient, cautious but not alarmist, and careful. They respect my compassion for my beloved dog’s health, and also my budget. They really care about their patients and the family’s of those patients.

Abbey Pet in El Cerrito has been taking care of my furry family members for at least 18 years. They have always provided excellent care and recommendations and the people there are friendly, helpful and professional. I was also impressed with the speed and (what seemed like but probably wasn’t) effortless transition to the curbside service when the pandemic hit. 

I’m writing this review because, about a week after they learned that my cat (and a longtime patient of theirs) had passed away, I received the nicest card with handwritten sympathy notes from each of the staff members in the mail. Their understanding of the difficulty of the loss of a beloved pet friend and the compassion that they showed was, to me, above and beyond what I expected.

Thank you for taking such good care of my animal loved ones over the years, and I look forward to many more.

Had a good experience. Organized facility. I had my dogs glands expressed, a check up and several services. I will have neutering done here. I adopted my dog from the Milo Foundation. No issues. Prices were normal. Dr. Hitchcock came out to my car and spoke to me regarding the results. Liked the communication.

Makena M.

I had to say goodbye to my boy this weekend and the Abbey team was amazing, amazing, amazing. Always patient, kind and helpful. The place could be packed but they have a way of making you feel like your the only one there. Attentive and friendly!

El Cerrito is lucky to have this vet. Every staff member is kind, knowledgable and patient. They truly understand everyone’s pet is the most important to them. I have had experience with all 3 vets on staff and each has offered a stellar experience where they really listen to tooooo yoyr concerns. I could not ask to put my precious pet in better hands. Thank you

Everyone here is amazing. The front staff, the techs, and the doctors! Everyone is very friendly and knowledgeable. I brought three animals to them over the years and they’ve never done less than a stellar job. Best Vet Ever!

Yesterday, my car battery died when we were preparing to leave. It was a hot day so the technician gave us water for my cats while we waited for AAA. They were busy, but they took the time to make sure we and our cats were ok. Thank you!

Pat W.

If there were 6 stars, that’s what I’d give Abbey Pet Hospital and most especially Dr. Jennie Kim. The staff is wonderful too – helpful, friendly and very very caring. Dr. Kim quite literally saved our beloved dogs life. We thought we were going to lose our darling cane corso pit mix, Othello to leptospirosis. But Dr. Kim wouldn’t have it – it took a month but with her tenacity, Othello now has a clean bill of health. My husband and I are so very grateful. Oh, and I forgot to say, Othello loves going to Abbey Pet Hosp now and he adores Dr. Kim. We couldn’t be happier.

As a 25 year client of Abbey Pet hospital with 6 dogs, and 6 birds, I am very happy with the care my animals have received. My current dog , a rat terrier with a heart murmur has been treated very well. She has bounced back with medication, seems to be content and enjoying her life. She surpassed the normal one year average life span of dogs with her condition. (congestive heart failure).I owe Abbey Pet hospital, Dr. Judd, the other two vets who treated her at different times for her continuing her life. All the staff, animal technicians, assistants, receptionists and other support for showing her nothing but, love. I am grateful to everyone. I can’t thank you all enough.

Linda C.

I would like to personally thank Dr. Kim & the entire supporting staff for the care, compassion & professionalism I received as a client. My dog was Sunny, he was a patient at Abby Pet Hospital for ten years until his recent passing. During our visits we/he was greeted by a friendly staff and seen by the vet promply upon arrival. Sunny was always excited and playful during each visit & was provided the best care possible to help him live a long healthy life. After he passed away Dr. Kim & the entire supporting staff sent me a signed card offering thier condolenses. The gesture was sincere and heartfelt, words can’t express the gratitude I feel from their thoughtfulness. I am forever grateful to have had a skilled, dedicated & compassionate vet hospital to help me care for my beloved Sunny. Thank you so much for everything, you are truly the best in my book. It was a pleasure and privilege for me and Sunny.
