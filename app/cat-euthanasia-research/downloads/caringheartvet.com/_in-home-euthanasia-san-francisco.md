# Services and Pricing

We provide affordable in-home euthanasia for families of the San Francisco Bay Area.

## Our Pricing and Services:

##### In-Home Euthanasia

Home Visit, Relaxing Sedation, and Euthanasia Service

Includes complimentary and optional fur clipping and clay paw print impression

  * For pets 60 lb and under: $550
  * For pets 61-80 lb: $600



Additional fees starting at $50-150 may apply for extended travel time (greater than 20 minutes driving distance), evening, weekend, holiday or short notice appointments.

During this difficult time, we’ll make sure the final moments with your pet are in the place they love most—home. During this home visit, we’ll ensure that all of your questions are answered and that your pet is as relaxed as can be. Arranging for this to happen at home avoids the stress of a typical veterinary visit and provides a more peaceful experience for your pet and your family.

Dr. Allegra is unable to provide appointments/cremation transport for dogs weighing over 75-80 lb.

##### Private Cremation

Your pet is cremated individually and the ashes returned to you. After our appointment, you will receive an email with a link to the product catalog to select the urn you would like for your pet’s ashes. Your choice of one of the eight standard urn options (most include a laser engraved name plate) is already included in the cost of cremation. There are also additional options, as well as a selection of other memorial items, available for an added fee.

Individual cremation ashes are usually returned to you in 10-14 business days by USPS with signature confirmation required.

  * $350

  * $200

##### Home Burial

Please check with your local city or county for regulations for pet burial.

## Our Policies:

##### Service Hours

Phone calls are returned between the hours of 8:30 am to 7 pm.

Appointments available seven days a week, including holidays, from 9:30 am to 7:30 pm.

If you have an urgent situation with your pet, please take them to the nearest veterinary emergency clinic.

##### Service Area

We operate within a one-hour (driving distance) radius of San Mateo including San Francisco, Marin County as far north as San Rafael, the Peninsula, coastal communities including Pacifica and HMB, East Bay including Alameda and Contra Costa counties, as far east as Walnut Creek/Concord and Livermore area, and South Bay as far south as south San Jose.

##### Payment Policy

We accept cash, check (preferred method and can be prepared ahead and made payable to Dr. Allegra Liu), and major credit cards.

##### Cancellation Policy

While Dr. Allegra does understand that cancellations are sometimes unavoidable, short-notice cancellation limits our availability to assist another family who may need help during that scheduled time. When possible, please let us know of any changes with 24-hour notice.

If a cancellation is requested less than twelve hours before the scheduled time we kindly reserve the right to charge a $400 cancellation fee, if cancellation is requested less than six hours prior there will be a $500 house call fee.

If the natural death of your pet occurs there will be no cancellation fee WITH THE EXCEPTION of an instance where the doctor has started driving or has already arrived. In the latter case there will be a $530 house call fee plus any additional fees (for extended travel time, short notice appointment, etc.) and any aftercare fees that may apply should the owner elect to have the doctor handle cremation services.

Thank you for understanding that this fee system is necessary for Caring Heart Veterinary Services to continue providing our excellent and compassionate level of care.
