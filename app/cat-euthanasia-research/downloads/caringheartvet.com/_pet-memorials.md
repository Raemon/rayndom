## In loving memory

#### Princeton

September 21, 2005 – September 18, 2022  
Princeton started life as “Jack” and chose us when we visited the San Francisco SPCA one weekend in early November 2005. They told us that he needed to be socialized but we found him pretty comfortable around us when he got home. We renamed him after the character Princeton from the Broadway musical, “Avenue Q” as he was full of life and wanted to see and learn everything in his world. He loved to chase after laser pointers and had a favorite little stuffed toy puppy that he really adored. He never liked catnip and liked to tease his older brother, Winston, a Senegal parrot. Princeton always lived indoors and had homes in Daly City and Oakland. He also had an older sister, Viveca, a sweet yellow Labrador Retriever but he was too scared to get to know her. He was my constant furry companion for 17 years. He would meow loudly every evening to let me know it was time to go to bed, stay with me until I fell asleep, and then would wake me up every morning at around 6 am (sometimes 7 on the weekend). He would greet me at the door when I came home from work. He always wanted to be in the same room as me and would head butt me to let me know when he wanted attention. Sometimes he would sleep on me. He was pretty much in charge of the house. He was the greatest kitty. I miss him already and we will always remember him. R.I.P. Princeton. See you at the Rainbow Bridge, Bubba!

#### BubbleToes

BubbleToes was born on September 19, 2004, according to our niece. We adopted her from our brother in 2005 after our nephew became allergic to cats. She came all the way from Southern California and was previously named Princess. We called her Bubble for short. She got along with Mookie, our first cat, and everyone we adopted throughout the years, including Tootsie, Mia, Scoobie, Blossom, Trixie, Pixie, SweetPea, Chuckie, Freddie, Gabriella, and Castiella. She kept us company and preferred to sit on one of the chairs in the kitchen. We put a flower cat bed on the chair so that she was comfortable. During the pandemic, my sister took online craft classes from Mrs. O’Leary in Kansas. Bubble was famous in Kansas since she actively participated during these Zoom classes.

#### Maria

Maria came into my life when I was 20 and we’ve gone everywhere together ever since. She crossed the country five times, visited 25 states (always preferring a hotel suite over camping), and lived in seven cities, two states, and one district. She did a brief stint as a supermodel and even warmed the heart of (at least) one Trump. She was known far and wide, and many people who had never met her had heard of the dog named Maria – her reputation and personality were too big to contain. She greeted everyone with endless kisses and a butt scratch (for herself, of course), and never left my side (even when on the pot). She was loyal, funny, and a force to be reckoned with. While I will miss my girl very much, I’m so grateful I got to meet her, and even more thankful I had 14- long, happy years with her in my life.  
My dog taught me many things and certainly made me a better person. Here are some of her best lessons: 

  * Smile big and smile often.
  * Everyone deserves love and a wag, even if they don’t reciprocate.
  * Rules that say you don’t belong are meant to be broken. Never let anyone tell you where to go.
  * If someone is ignoring you, knock something over.
  * Don’t ever pass up an opportunity for a free butt scratch.
  * More importantly: don’t ever let someone else pass up the opportunity to give you a butt scratch.
  * There’s never a good reason not to snuggle (and don’t worry about people complaining that you’re too heavy to sit on them; they appreciate it deep down.)
  * Say yes to every adventure, go on every ride, and see all there is to see.



I don’t know what happens after we die, but I like to think she’s found herself a tennis court somewhere full of balls to steal and maybe a big, grassy field to run at breakneck speed again and hunt for bugs. Either way, Maria had such a big, bright spirit that no matter what happens, the universe absolutely got a little kinder and happier now that her spirit is free. Once in a while, you meet a soul who is larger than life, and Maria the pooch most certainly was.  
To say that Miloh was affectionate would be an understatement. He would always give his loved ones an endless supply of doggie kisses (even when we asked him not to! Haha). Riding in the driver’s seat was his favorite during car rides, he always needed to be near someone! He loved his older brother (Augy the doggy) and would always be looking out for him. Whenever we had family parties, Miloh would be quick to greet people at the door. And if he noticed someone was ill or had a little too much fun at the party, he would lay next to them to sleep until they woke up feeling fine.  
Miloh was a fighter; he had survived cancer once only to have it come back a 2nd time. When he had been diagnosed a 2nd time, he was given four more weeks to live, but he lived for ten more! We are all sad to have Miloh gone, but happy that we had got to spoil him so much longer during his last days. It was a great ten years with my little guy, and I know he’s all smiles in doggy heaven.

#### Miloh

Miloh was always a scrappy little guy. We had gotten him from the shelter where he ended up after being found roaming the streets for scraps of food. Always the crafty one, he would find ways to escape from his locked crate, jump through open windows, push through slightly opened doors, or steal food from the dinner table when nobody was looking.

#### Sadie

We rescued Sadie 1 year and 19 days before we had to let her go. She was the dog of our dreams – an avid cuddler, hiker, and loyal beyond words. She traveled with us effortlessly as we moved across the country during COVID. A pittie that couldn’t stand the cold, she thrived in CA sunshine. Sadie will be remember by all she touched as sweet, intelligent, and her parent’s best friend. Cancer sucks, but we know you are in peace now, sweet girl.

#### Coby

Coby the malamute joined our family when he was 5 years old. Coby was everyone’s favorite as he was the sweetest and happiest dog to be around. He enjoyed rolling around the grass and meeting people. Definitely a head turner everywhere he goes, his smile and happy energy was contagious. We miss his loud howls, loud stomps around the house, his yearly snow trips and more. Not a day goes by where we don’t miss him, Coby was the perfect family dog. He is one of a kind and he will be forever in our hearts.

#### Warwick

Warwick the Munchkin cat was part of our family for exactly 1600 days. He had been sitting in a county shelter as a stray at the young age of 13 years old for over a month before we made the roadtrip to bring him home from 400 miles away in Southern California. That’s a long way for a little guy with teeny legs! He came with a paw print signed letter from the shelter promising that he would love us forever if we loved him back. We hope we were everything he could have wished for.

#### Blueberry

We found Blueberry at the SF SPCA. She was around 2 years old and had clearly been through a rough life. She had recently whelped puppies and was emaciated. She had scars up and down her face and torso, the doctor says likely from someone trying to fight her in dogfights. We knew she was our dog from the moment we laid eyes on her, and we were 100% right. She came home with us that day and we loved her from then until her passing with a ferocious love. She was a kind, gentle, caring, and majestic dog and earned the title “Good Girl” every single day. We ache for her, and her sister, Loganberry (another rescue) does too. We plan to honor her by adopting a new rescue as soon as possible!

#### Zara

This is a picture of Zara in Tahoe.

Zara was always full of life. She woke up every day excited. It’s like she knew every day was a gift! Her happiness was contagious. She never met a stranger. Person or pup, they were all her buds!

#### Toffee

Toffee was so loved. He was our companion and our protector. As little as he was, he thought he was a big dog. We will miss his unconditional love, his expressive eyes, and his zoomies when we come home. He is truly missed.

#### Curtis

August 21st, 2008 – November 14th, 2023 

Curtis joined his family in San Mateo on October 17th, 2008. He was the best surprise they could have ever experienced. Anyone who knows his family, knows how much they love Curtis. His family adored him deeply, and found happiness through him every day. Curtis brought a smile out of all people he encountered, and gave so much joy and comfort to those around him. He was a son, brother, protector, lover, and best friend to his whole family. Curtis enjoyed traveling California with them, especially to Truckee and Oroville. He loved the outdoors, whether it be the mountains, streets of San Mateo, or his front and back yard. Curtis accumulated more miles walked and destinations visited than most dogs could ever imagine. His family took him everywhere they could, shared all their food, and constantly drowned him in cuddles and kisses. He will be remembered as the sweetest, cutest, smartest, most loyal, gentle, and loving dog, who enjoyed nothing more than to eat, play, explore, and simply be with his family. Curtis provided 15 years of so much joy and love to his family, and they gave him 15 years of the best life possible. He was the kindest, happiest, funniest, and best dog. He was just what his family needed. Although he will be greatly missed, Curtis is comfortable and at peace now — softly sleeping, eating all the tri tip possible, and chasing all the squirrels and tennis balls he could ever dream of. Curtis will always be in his family’s hearts, and his loving memory will last forever. They will always be a family of 6.

#### Marge Ayres

With a rusty meow reminiscent of her namesake, Marge Simpson, Marge was a loving member of our family for 8 years. Her origins are unknown before she was taken in by the SF SPCA in 2013, but we imagine she had a pretty hard life on the streets and may have been feral. She was slow to trust and was not a fan of strangers, unless they came bearing treats (Greenies specifically). She loved her parents and only us, showing us her playful and sweet sides that most people didn’t get to see. Before cancer left her mostly bedridden, her favorite activities included playing “soccer” with her dad, chasing the laser, and snuggling very close to us on the bed or the couch (but never sitting in our laps!). She begrudgingly accepted her little brother Bart, and enjoyed chasing him around the house and wrestling, but mostly he annoyed her. We are grateful for her years of love and wish we had many more with her.

#### Smoke

Our passionate, intense, smart, beautiful Smoke left us last evening with a peaceful send-off. For a little being, she packed a powerful presence. 

Whether attending our book club meetings with her arms daintily crossed (she had to have her own chair), or helping with the baking (if butter was involved), or leaping up on my back to more closely supervise my cooking, or seriously hunting her play ribbon—whatever she did was done with all her concentration and intensity.

We were lucky to have her love.  
RIP Smoke 2007-2021

#### Riley Dean

Riley Dean came to us when he was about a month old. He was a special kitten, diagnosed with moderate to severe Cerebellar Hypoplasia, which affected his motor skills and made it difficult for him to walk without falling or eat and drink without bobbing his head. There was some fear that he was a kitten that he might not make it, but he made our home complete for eighteen years and three months. He was a handsome, feisty, affectionate boy, and we are so lucky that he spent his life with us.

#### Hudson (Huddy)

We lost the love of our lives, our wonderful 15 1/2 year old yellow lab last Friday. He loved to get the newspaper every morning, and also loved his bone after. LOL. He will be so missed!!!

#### Lucy

I have lost part of my heart and soul that can never be replaced. My constant companion gave me fulfillment when my life was at its worst and at its best. She was my person and I was hers. I hope you are running free again and have no pain. Will see you again, my love, on the other side! A void now exists in my life but will treasure your memory forever.

#### Kira

Kira was a firecracker. She had enough personality to fill an entire room. I’m honored to have been your human for 13 years. Love you little bear.

#### Saba

Saba was part of our family for over 11 years. She was so special, a beautiful soul loved by everyone. She will be greatly missed but at least we have memories and she will stay in our hearts ❤ forever.

#### Max

Max was a GREAT dog. Harriers are not a common breed – less than 500 in the whole country. We had to drive 8 hours each way and stay overnight to get him, but it was so worth it. Our house is far less full with him not here anymore, but we know he’s in a better place with an infinite supply of rabbits to chase and eat as much steak, chicken, and especially cheese as he wants!

#### Finnamore

Finnamore came into my life in 2001 when he stumbled onto my front steps looking for food as a tiny kitten. We nursed him back to health and he was a welcome member of the family for almost 20 years before he passed. He was a special cat and a good friend, always available for a snuggle or wanting a chin scratch, and he will always be in our hearts.  
Miss you Tuxedo boy.

#### Cookie

Cookie was the sweetest German Shepherd dog and was a wonderful companion to Tom who is physically challenged. We miss her very much.

#### Natasha

Natasha was my little buddy. She always greeted me at the door and liked to be in the same room as me. She was thrilled when I became a pescatarian because she got to eat fresh fish every day. She made my life happier and richer every day. I am honored to have been her mom for the past 10 years. She was a good friend.

#### Tater

Tater came to me when he was just a pup. He was my faithful companion for 15 years, which is nearly half my life. He shared the ups and downs, the highs and lows, and all the challenges of this life with me. He was loved by so many, including his “sister” Tinky, my parents, my husband, and my dear son, who misses him daily. There will never be another dog like him. He was one of my absolute best friends, and his memory will be with me always.

#### Cristael Galdamez

Cristael could make any bad day better with just her smile. We were lucky to have spent 12 years of her life with us. She was a loving, caring, and beautiful Pittie. She showed us unconditional love and was a true friend. Her curiosity, energy, and soul will never be forgotten. Whenever we were home, we always felt safe and loved by her. We will miss her dearly, and we know that she is in doggy heaven chasing all the squirrels, eating all the hot dogs, and chewing on her favorite toys. She looks down on us and smiles, knowing that we will always hold a special place in our hearts for her. Rest in Paradise, my darling. We love you!

#### Dinah

Who knew back in September of 2000 that I would meet the dearest cat I’ve ever known and that she would be with me for 21 years, brightening every day we spent together. Dinah, your grumpy meow and resting judgmental face kept me grounded through the good and the bad, and you were one of the best cats to ever cat, you will forever be in our hearts. Sleep well, baby girl, and keep your brother Finnamore from getting into too much trouble. We love you, forever and ever.

#### Shyla

Shyla was our entire world. She was the happiest, most outgoing, goofy soul you’d ever meet. Unfortunately she went through too much as a pup for her to overcome. We showered her with so much love and affection, she was our family. There’s a huge hole in our family without our sweet girl but we know she’s at peace now. You will forever be with us sweet girl.

#### Snowy

Found in a flower box as part of a feral litter, we fostered Snowy and his 4 siblings. We knew the minute he came into our house as a kitten that he wasn’t leaving.  
Snowy was the most loving, hilarious cat we’ve ever known. He was a gentle, loyal friend. Trusting and open. He gave us 13 years of joy. We’ll miss him forever. Thank you, Snowy, for being you and sharing your life with us.

#### Samantha

Samantha was the kitten of a feral cat. She and her siblings were rescued at six weeks so that they could find homes. My six-year-old child choose her. She was the most beautiful cat. And the best hunter of any cat we ever had had (which was not fun when she would come inside with her prey). She was hit by a car (hit and run) when she was about four years old. It caused her to go blind over time. But she was amazing in how she adapted to her blindness and lived until she was 15 years old. She was stubborn and fearless and loved to cuddle. Near the end, she was my baby girl, and I tended to her as she went downhill until I couldn’t let her suffer anymore. Even when she could hardly walk she still did all of her “Samantha” things like crawling into bags, tearing up paper, and meowing when I did something she didn’t like. She had a tremendous spirit.

#### Kitty

A shy but very sweet girl. Thanks for sharing 16 years with me!

#### Gatsby 

May 1, 2002 – August 10, 2020

Gatsby came to us when he was a month old. He loved snuggling and kisses. He loved to fall asleep with his head tucked into my neck. He loved to look out onto the backyard and soak in the morning sun in his favorite spot next to the sliding glass patio door. He loved salmon and lentil beans. He was my heart for eighteen years. Our whole family loved him completely and will always love him. He will always be with us.

#### Murphy

Here is a picture of Murphy Carter with his favorite soccer ball. We bought him a new one right after we took this picture. He would only fetch soccer balls and loved to play keep away and carry them around the yard. He was so much fun and such a sweetheart.

#### Lucy

Lucy was a beautiful soul who brought our family so much love, support, and laughter. She was mine and my kids emotional support animal during my cancer treatments and I miss her so much it hurts. She will live on in our memories and we honor her by telling stories of her often. Love you lucy I hope you are running around a big field filled with wildflowers.

#### Rosie

Rosie came to us as a foster through a small rescue. I saw the request for a foster on Craigslist, and my heart went out to her…she very quickly became our first “Foster Failure!” She was a sweet, sweet 2 year old little girl…probably a Chi-weenie? She never needed or asked for much but enjoyed as many head rubs, kisses and pets we had to give her. She was a very treasured, important, loved and just wonderful part of our family and we are and will always miss her being with us. Rest In Peace our sweet Rosie…love you, miss you, kiss you…
