# Our Team

### Certified Hospice and Palliative Care Veterinarian - Tiffany Ma, DVM, CHPV

Dr. Tiffany Ma obtained her veterinary degree from UC Davis in 2006. After graduation, she received a year of advanced training at Veterinary Medical and Surgical Group in Ventura, a highly competitive internship program where she worked closely with many reputable specialists in the field. Dr. Ma practiced small animal medicine in Los Angeles and in the Bay Area for 9 years before becoming a hospice veterinarian. She founded Compassion Pet Hospice in early 2015 in loving memory of [Lucky](/us/about-us/our-team/12-about-us/67-lucky), her 17-year-old Papillon Mixed. Dr. Ma took care of Lucky in the last few months of his life at home. Lucky passed away in a familiar setting peacefully and with dignity, surrounded by many family members and friends who loved him. The experience was so profound that Dr. Ma started Compassion Pet Hospice with her husband to share this precious gift with other pet parents and pets.

Dr. Ma is also fluent in Chinese. It is her passion to serve the community with her unique background, her professional training, and her caring and compassionate heart.

Dr. Ma is the first veterinarian of Chinese descent to receive certification in the field of Hospice and Palliative Care. She graduated from the inaugural [AHPC certification program](https://iaahpc.org/veterinary-certification/) in 2017 and was an early pioneer in the field. She also completed the expert training in the art of gentle euthanasia through The Companion Animal Euthanasia Training Academy.

  


### Business Manager - Calvin Ho

Calvin, the husband of Dr. Ma, provides IT and business support to the practice. He also specializes in a virtual phone assistant technology that powers other veterinarian practices. In his spare time, Calvin works as a software consultant and serves on the board of Project Peace of the East Bay.
