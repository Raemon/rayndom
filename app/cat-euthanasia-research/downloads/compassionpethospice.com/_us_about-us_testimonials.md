## Testimonials

#### 

#### "Dear Dr. Ma, 

#### Hope you are doing well. It took us a couple of days sinking in what happened in the past week and we want to drop you a quick note to express how grateful we are to have you conducting the procedure for Teto. 

#### As you could see he was our treasure, we are so thankful that he was right next to us and he was spending his last moments on earth at his most comfortable place. Although it was one of the saddest days of our life, you made it easy for us. We really cherish your professionalism and your sympathy and empathy. With your guidance, we find our own ways to mourn and we are taking baby-steps getting used to a life without him. Thank you so much for being here that day! 

#### Btw, we really appreciate your courage in doing such a challenging job. We feel very lucky having you and I am sure all your clients will find the same."

#### \--Fontane & Jason from Alameda

#### _"Thank you Dr. Ma, for your graceful, compassionate presence during Rudy's passing. Your skilled professionalism brought relief to our pain and by allowing our process to unfold, you were truly an angel of mercy._

#### _We appreciated the idea of a clay paw print, so we decided to have both front paws imprinted. Glad we did! Rudy was cremated and his ashes returned to us before a few days time. We are sooo thankful that we found Dr. Ma and that she had such a personalization for us to remember Rudy, our beloved English Bully.  
Rudy was a rescue and came to us when he was 5. He was an angel in a dog suit. The sweetest pup full of love. His time with us was too short. We miss him everyday. At 10 yrs old he took ill and was hospitalized. Sadly, with a terminal diagnosis and rapid decline, he returned home where he peacefully transitioned surrounded by his loving family.   
Rudy's family thanks you, Dr. Ma for enabling his peaceful transition at home. We are eternally grateful."_

#### _\--Mitch & Jim from San Francisco_

#### \-- Maria from Fremont

#### 

#### _"Thank you again Dr. Ma for all you did to keep Bleu's quality of life better during her battle and giving us 2 more weeks with her. I'm so blessed to have found you and you were there for us to end Bleu's suffering. You were sent to us to ease all of our pain even at the end._

#### _Thank you for the beautiful card and your beautiful words ❤️  
I believe the Lord sent you to us knowing how difficult it would be to have a wonderful caring Dr. would make it easier to say goodbye.  
As difficult as that was, I am so very blessed you were there and the way you treated her so caring, loving and made her death so peaceful.  
I feel a connection with you and you were meant to do this... I hope everyone that has a terminally ill pet is fortunate enough to find you.  
I will plant those Blue forget-me-nots in my precious girl's memory.  
You are truly beautiful person inside and out and I thank you from the bottom of my heart for all you did for Bleu."_
