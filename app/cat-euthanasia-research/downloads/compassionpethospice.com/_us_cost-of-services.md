It does not include the cost of cremation - see below for aftercare options.

Two-hour appointment time is assigned to each euthanasia visit. Although you may not need that much time, we want you to know there is no rush at any point and you can take your time to say goodbye to your beloved. We can also discuss any concern you may have prior to signing the euthanasia consent form.

If the euthanasia appointment takes longer than two hours, there will be an overtime fee of $100 per each additional 30 minutes interval.

Additional clay paw print ($30 each) can be requested ahead of time.

An additional $150 for evening, weekend, and holiday appointment.

In-home euthanasia is for dogs, cats, and small mammals (e.g. rabbits, rats, guinea pigs, chinchillas, etc). Unfortunately, Dr. Ma is not able to serve dogs weighing over 99 lbs, nor can she serve birds, fish, reptiles or amphibians.

**In-home Consultation Visit $750***

The in-home consultation visit covers any individual or combination of our core services: palliative care, hospice care, and chronic pain management.

The 2.5-hour initial home consultation includes review of medical records, quality of life evaluation, thorough physical exam, dispensing of medications, treatments/procedures if indicated, an individualized care plan, and two weeks of on-going care through communication via emails, phone calls, or texts.

After fine-tuning the customized care plan for two weeks, client has an option to continue the active care relationship through on-going communication for $180 per month. Follow-up in-home visit (euthanasia or recheck) happening during the first week or during active on-going care, will have a reduced house call fee of $450. 

Follow up visit after the first two weeks, without on-going active care relationship, will be $500.

Medications, lab work, and supplies fees are priced separately.

An additional $150 to evening, weekend, and holiday appointment. 

Palliative and hospice care are limited to dogs and cats only.

**Deceased Pet Care $250**

If natural death happens before the euthanasia appointment, we can still come to your house to make a personalized clay paw print, provide you the grief and pet loss information, and pick up your pet for cremation OR prepare your pet for burial. We will also notify your family veterinarian of your pet's passing. It does not include the cost of cremation - see below for aftercare options.

An additional $150 for evening, weekend, and holiday appointment.

Aftercare Options

_We entrust[Animal Memorial Service](http://www.animalmemorialservice.com/) (AMS) in taking care of our patients' bodies after the transition. All pets are electronically identified and bar coded to ensure pet tracking accuracy. All pets are treated with reverent care and handled individually, gently and always with dignified respect. _

**Individual Cremation**

Your pet is cremated individually and the ashes is returned to you in [one of our complimentary urns](/us/cost-of-services/10-services/66-urns "Complimentary Urns").

You can order a [digital paw print](/us/component/jce/?view=popup&tmpl=component) of your pet. The digital paw print is free for private cremation and it costs $15 for communal cremation.

Your pet's cremains may be picked up from your primary veterinary office or AMS crematorium in Gilroy, or shipped directly to you (with signature and tracking number). Special arrangement can also be made with Dr. Ma for in-person ashes return. Ashes return will take 10-14 days in general.

Under 20 lbs $350

20-69 lbs $375

70-99 lbs $410

Dr. Ma is not able to serve animals weighing over 99 lbs.

Witness cremation is available. If you have any specific need regarding aftercare options, please contact Dr. Ma directly to discuss further before making the appointment. 

**Communal Cremation**

In a communal cremation, your pet will be cremated with other beloved pets. Their ashes will be respectfully scattered in the Pacific Ocean by [Oceans of Love](https://www.oceansoflovepets.com/).

Under 25 lbs $200

25-69 lbs $225 

70-99 lbs $250

Dr. Ma is not able to serve animals weighing over 99 lbs.

  


**Private Burial**

For private burial in pet memorial park, you can make arrangement ahead of time with the pet cemetery directly. Both [Bubbling Well](http://www.bubbling-well.com) in Napa and [Pet's Rest](http://www.petsrest.com/home.php) in Colma provide this professional service.

For home burial, you should check your local and county regulations. If animal burial is allowed, an average-sized pet should be buried at least 3 feet deep underground. This depth is important not only to prevent your pet from being disturbed by wildlife, but also to prevent the wildlife from ingesting a pet that has euthanasia solution within them. It is the responsibility of the pet owner, as well as the veterinarian, to prevent injury to wildlife. Because the burial depth is deep, you also need to be cautious of water and power lines.

## Additional Information
