# Online Quality of Life Assessment 

During an online Quality of Life Assessment, Dr. Ma can help walk your family through the decision making processes toward the end of your pet’s life. Many families are unsure if they are making the right choices for their pet- often wondering if they are not doing enough, doing too much, or if they are “keeping them around just for us.” These highly emotional decisions can be complicated and some families need professional assistance in clear decision making.

Online Quality of Life Assessments can help you determine if your pet is in pain or if their daily struggles are compromising their dignity and quality of life. Dr. Ma can offer additional guidance to help improve your pet’s quality of life - general treatment options, tips for giving oral medications, ways to encourage eating, and small changes in the home and yard to further support your pet.

Online Quality of Life Assessments can also help determine if other palliative and supportive care options are available. Dr. Ma will help your family decide if and when it will be time to consider euthanasia. Assessments will also include a description of how to prepare for euthanasia and what to expect during that visit. These discussions can be personalized to include advice for preparing for loss with children, other pets in the home, and any unique family circumstances. Our virtual consultations last approximately 1-1.5 hour, providing the time needed to discuss your pet’s quality of life in a non-hurried and supportive manner, taking into consideration your concerns and goals.

California veterinary telemedicine law, established by AB 1399 which went into effect January 1, 2024, allows veterinarians to establish a Veterinarian-Client-Patient Relationship (VCPR) remotely, enabling them to provide care via telehealth without a prior in-person exam in most cases. Key requirements include ensuring the animal is in California, obtaining client consent for telehealth, maintaining patient records, and using sound professional judgment to determine if telehealth is appropriate. There are limitations, such as restrictions on prescribing certain drugs and a prohibition on prescribing certain medications for horses in racing or training.

California state law places certain limits on a veterinarian’s ability to prescribe medications using telemedicine. Specifically, using this method, veterinarians:

  * Cannot prescribe controlled drugs (e.g. opioids, sedatives, etc.)

  * Can only prescribe up to 14 days of antimicrobials (e.g., antibiotics, antifungals, etc.)

  * Can only prescribe long term medications for up to 6 months

  * Cannot prescribe drugs off-label




Prescriptions for your pet can be filled at our online pharmacy or, should you prefer, Dr. Ma can call in the prescription for you to fill at the pharmacy of your choice.  
  


# Phone Consultation

  
If you don't need long conversation or review of medical records, we also offer 10-minutes complimentary phone consultation. If the phone call takes longer than ten minutes, there will be a phone consultation fee associated with it.
