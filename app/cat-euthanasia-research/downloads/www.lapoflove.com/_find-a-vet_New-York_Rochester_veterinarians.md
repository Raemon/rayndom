#### About Dr. Adria Schlemme

I grew up in Northern California and Texas. My early childhood was spent in the small town of Petaluma nestled in the rolling hills of Sonoma County. It was an idyllic setting for an early nature-lover like myself. Every weekend, we were off exploring redwood forests, coastal beaches, or fog-filled mountain tops. Growing up in Arlington, Texas, we took advantage of our neighboring city, Fort Worth. The city offers a unique blend of cowboy culture and fine art and there was always a fun museum or park to explore.

For as long as I can remember, I’ve always wanted to become a vet! I loved accompanying my mom to vet appointments. I even wrote in an early journal when I was 8 years old that I wanted to become a vet. In high school, my mom and I volunteered as wildlife rehabilitators and this was my first experience directly caring for fragile or sick animals. Though challenging at times (particularly when feeding baby squirrels around the clock), it was extremely rewarding and further fueled my interest in animal science.

I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Biology from Wellesley College in Massachusetts and later moved across country to obtain my Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine from Western University in Pomona, California. I currently reside in Canandaigua, New York where I have been able to live out my dream of taking care of pets. After vet school, I became particularly passionate about surgery - the skill and execution involved is satisfying to me. (Plus, my years of embroidery and crafting were great preparation for the techniques involved!). I love creative problem solving and putting together clues to find answers and explanations. I also enjoy connecting with the families of the pets, offering compassion and insight while caring for their special family members.

I’ve personally lost one of my own dearest pets, my cat Eliza. She arrived on our doorstep in Texas when I was twelve years old, and immediately bonded with me, making my room her home. While we weren’t sure of her age when we adopted her, she seemed older, so we were all surprised when she lived for another decade. It was the summertime when her health began deteriorating significantly. My family made the decision for euthanasia and we traveled with Eliza to a local veterinary clinic. While the timing was right, the experience at the end was not. Saying goodbye to my companion was agonizing and made more challenging by being in a public space. This experience shaped my desire to bring compassion and respect into end-of-life care for our pets. End of life care is a delicate area of practice. Death is not often a subject that is easy to talk about and face. Being able to provide a calming and supportive presence for the families during this period is a gratifying additional benefit of hospice care. Understanding what this process feels like inspires me in my quest to provide compassionate care for the animals and empathetic support for the people who love them.

Outside of my work as a veterinarian, I’m a big fan of being outside and love spending beautiful days on long walks or hikes. I also enjoy cooking and am always trying new recipes and plotting ways to use everything in my CSA box. 

#### About Dr. Gabrielle Faragasso

I’m originally from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania but my family purchased a small hobby farm outside of Binghamton, New York when I was 5 years old. I grew up surrounded by cats, dogs, chickens, cows, pigs, and horses, and becoming a veterinarian seemed like the most logical way to turn my hobby into a career. 

I attended Villanova University, and while I knew that I wanted to be a veterinarian, I also loved to read and write. I balanced my interests by majoring in English and using my elective classes to fulfill the vet school prerequisites. After graduating, I attended veterinary school at the University of Pennsylvania and completed an equine internship in Rochester. 

Before and during veterinary school, I worked in small animal practices. However, after growing up on a farm, ambulatory medicine will always have a special place in my heart. My primary interests include preventive medicine and ophthalmology. After veterinary school, I completed a one-year equine ambulatory internship and then worked as an ambulatory equine practitioner for three years. I found that one of the most fulfilling aspects of my job was performing on-farm euthanasia appointments. Being able to provide an opportunity for the owner to say goodbye to their best friend in a space they are comfortable in, surrounded by the people who love them, is a very special gift. I am grateful to be able to extend that opportunity to small animal families as well. 

I lost my first horse, Sunshine, to equine infectious anemia when I was in elementary school. I remember how devastated I was, but I also remember how patient and kind the veterinarian was as I navigated the emotions of frustration, sadness, and helplessness. He explained how this was a very kind decision for her condition and that not letting her suffer is a gift that we can extend to our pets. 

When I’m not working, I love to be outside, run, and hike with my dog. I also enjoy exploring the Rochester food scene and traveling when I can! 

#### About Dr. Cate Mattson

I grew up in Albany, New York. Although my love for animals started early, I didn’t follow a pre-veterinary track in college. My first job after graduation was in finance and in my free time, I volunteered at an animal shelter. That experience changed my life. I found so much joy in caring for animals in need that I decided to leave my job, complete a post-baccalaureate pre-health program, and apply to vet school. I eventually earned my doctorate of veterinary medicine from Cornell University’s College of Veterinary Medicine.

As a veterinarian, my focus has been on canine and feline primary care, surgery, and end-of-life care. I love helping animals live their best lives, whether that means performing a life-saving procedure or simply offering comfort and support in their final moments. There’s something deeply rewarding about building relationships with pets and their families and I’m honored to be part of those connections.

Losing my own personal pets has helped shape how I approach my work, especially end-of-life care. I’ve always appreciated that the word “euthanasia” means “good death” in Greek. It’s such a compassionate gift we can give our animals when their quality of life has diminished. I’m grateful for the chance to provide comfort and peace to pets and their families during these incredibly meaningful moments.

#### About Dr. Lauri Crimmins

I grew up in Big Flats, New York, although the town isn’t big or flat. It had an elementary school, but I attended middle and high school in the nearby town of Horseheads—if you’re intrigued, ask me how the town got its name!

I first became interested in veterinary medicine at the age of 5 when my childhood dog, Shamus, saved my brother and me from a rabid skunk. Because we had recently moved and didn’t have a vet, Shamus hadn’t received a rabies booster in recent years and was quarantined for six months. 

I went to SUNY Binghamton for my undergraduate biochemistry degree and the University of Tennessee for veterinary school. As a practicing veterinarian, I love the variety that zoo medicine brings. I also enjoy performing acupuncture and any opportunity to continue learning and providing comfort to my patients and their families.

I first became interested in providing end-of-life care while caring for chimpanzees, when I realized how critical those last moments can be for the animal and those who love them. I’ve also had both good and bad personal experiences saying goodbye to animals throughout my life. 

Humane euthanasia is such a difficult and selfless decision, and my goal is to ensure it is the best experience possible for the pet and their family. Through Lap of Love, I provide others with the service I would want for myself when it is time for my furry babies to cross the rainbow bridge. 

Outside work, I enjoy the “lake life” with my extended family, especially my nephew and niece. I also enjoy drawing, swimming, walking with my dog, and cuddling with my cat.
