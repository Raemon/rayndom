As you get older, you may not run up and down the stairs with a child’s energy anymore, and your pet likely feels the same way. As your furry pal advances in age, or suffers a disease, routine activities become more difficult. Navigation, including climbing stairs, scaling furniture, and stepping over the side of the litter box, is a common issue for senior pets. If your senior pet has decreased mobility because of osteoarthritis, cancer, or another disease, update your home to make access easier. Blind or deaf pets can also struggle to navigate, but some minor changes can help.

## #1: Build ramps to your senior pet’s favorite resting places

If your older pet can no longer leap onto the couch to snuggle, and instead whines for a boost, place a ramp next to their favorite resting area. Many pets don’t realize their muscles are weak or their joints are painful until they try to jump, and they can fall and hurt themselves. Provide easier access to couches, beds, and your cat’s windowsill perch with a sturdy ramp that gives your pet traction. 

## #2: Provide traction on slick floors for your senior pet

Tile, linoleum, and hardwood floors are often too slick to provide traction for your senior pet with mobility issues. Place carpet runners on commonly traveled walkways, and apply grip aids to your pet to increase traction. [Dr. Buzby’s ToeGrips](https://toegrips.com/) and [PawFriction](https://pawfriction.com/) are two products that work well for pets and are easy to apply at home.

## #3: Don’t confuse your senior pet by rearranging the furniture

Many senior pets suffer from cognitive dysfunction, despite showing no obvious signs. However, one common sign of declining mental function is the inability to remember locations, for example, of their food and water bowls. They may also become stuck behind furniture, or head to the hinge side of the door they want opened. Keep your pet’s necessities, such as their bed and food and water dishes, in the same place, to avoid confusion. Changes in routine or in their home life can upset pets with cognitive dysfunction, and they may experience stress and anxiety, so limit rearranging your furniture.

## #4: Use sounds, hand signals, and scents to help your blind or deaf pet navigate

Refraining from moving your furniture is key for a blind pet, who can become familiar with the general layout and avoid bumping into items, but other methods also can help blind or deaf pets navigate or follow you. Jingling bells by the door, “Come here” hand gestures, and [scent markers](https://www.innovetpet.com/products/tracerz-scent-markers-for-blind-dogs?variant=32334649622602) can help your pet navigate your home safely. 

## #5: Block your pet’s access to staircases

Stairs are tough for a pet suffering from decreased mobility, and can lead to a nasty fall. Thwart your pet from attempting to navigate your home’s stairs by placing a baby gate across the entrance. If your pet is small enough to carry, you can tote them up and down the stairs as needed, but if they are too large to hoist, find an alternative. Building a ramp may not be feasible, so keep all your pet’s necessities on the ground floor, and use a ramp outdoors if your pet needs help entering and leaving your home.

With a few simple changes, you can help your furry companion navigate your home more easily, despite advancing mobility issues or other disease processes.
