If your pet has been diagnosed with cancer, your mind is likely racing, and you may fail to take in everything your family veterinarian says. Such an overwhelming diagnosis can make deciding on the first steps of your pet’s cancer management journey extremely difficult. To help guide you through this challenging time, learn more about what to expect after your pet’s cancer diagnosis.

## What will happen after your pet’s cancer diagnosis?

After your family veterinarian has diagnosed your pet with cancer, likely through a combination of blood work, a fine-needle aspirate, and a biopsy, you will be referred to a veterinary oncologist for specialized care. The veterinary oncologist will determine your pet’s overall health, evaluate the cancer’s stage, and grade the disease aggression. Your pet will undergo a series of diagnostic tests to provide this information, which will be used to create the best treatment plan. Diagnostic tests may include:

* Complete blood count (CBC) — A CBC measures your pet’s red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Abnormalities can indicate anemia, infection, inflammation, and clotting disorders that can all be associated with cancerous processes.

* Blood chemistry profile — A blood chemistry profile analyzes your pet’s organ function. Cancer can affect or spread to various organs; changes discovered through this test will help determine which organs are affected.

* Cytology — A fine-needle aspirate or biopsy will provide a cellular sample of your pet’s tumor to help your veterinary oncologist diagnose, stage, and grade the cancer.

* X-rays — Tumors can often be detected on X-rays, whether they are formed from soft tissue or bone. And, since many cancers metastasize and spread to the lungs and other organs, X-rays can also detect the cancer spread. 

These initial tests will help your veterinary oncologist decide on the necessity for additional diagnostic testing, such as an ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI. Armed with the most information possible about your pet’s cancer, your oncologist can determine the best, most effective treatment course.

## What to expect with surgery for your pet

If your pet is a surgical candidate, the tumor may be removed completely or partially to debulk the growth. Some bony tumors, like osteosarcoma, are best treated through amputation of the affected limb, while parts of a pet’s jaw may be removed if cancer infects the jawbone. Your veterinary oncologist can tell if your pet is a surgical candidate with diagnostic imaging. However, keep in mind that surgery is often paired with chemotherapy or radiation to eradicate or slow the growth of remaining cancerous cells. 

## What to expect with chemotherapy for your pet

Chemotherapy focuses on treating cancer with medications and is a component of most treatment plans. In general, chemotherapy is administered intravenously in a veterinary hospital, but some medications can be given orally at home. Chemotherapy is used to treat cancerous cells that could not be safely reached during surgical removal, for cells that have spread, or for pets who are not good surgical candidates. Unlike human chemotherapy, which often causes debilitating side effects, the chemotherapy agents and doses used for pets typically cause few side effects. You won’t have to worry about your pet suffering from hair loss, horrible nausea—although some nausea can be normal—or other negative side effects. 

## What to expect with radiation therapy for your pet

Radiation therapy requires general anesthesia to ensure your pet does not move during the treatment when a targeted beam is focused on the cancerous tissue to help shrink a tumor or slow cancer growth. Keeping your pet completely still with general anesthesia unaffected nearby healthy tissue. In most cases, pets require several radiation therapy rounds, and a treatment plan can stretch out for weeks.
