Adopting any pet, much less a senior version is a serious commitment that requires careful consideration. An adopted senior pet may not bless you with long companionship like a younger pet, but young or old, choosing the perfect cat or dog for your family is important. You are dedicating yourself to love and care for this pet, no matter what comes their way, and senior pets are at a higher risk for developing many conditions that occur with old age. Still, senior pets have much to offer, so consider the following tips before opening your home—and your heart—to an older dog or cat.

## #1: Understand the potential physical challenges of a senior pet

As we age—pets included—our bodies slow down, and routine daily activities become more challenging. If you adopt a senior pet, understand that they may be slower to rise in the morning and spend most of their time sleeping. In addition, many senior pets are afflicted with painful osteoarthritis, which can significantly impair their mobility, and they may find navigating stairs and furniture difficult. While this is not a huge concern if you adopt a small pet you can easily carry, a large one in a home with stairs can be challenging. 

A senior pet may pose other physical challenges like vision and hearing loss. Although these are not as concerning as mobility loss, they can be challenging to manage if you are unprepared. Fully understand your new senior pet’s physical limitations—and your own—before committing to a lifelong adoption. 

## #2: Assess your finances before adopting a senior pet

Puppies and kittens can be expensive, especially if they’re mischievous and prone to accidents. Still, senior pets can also place a burden on your finances. Older pets often develop health conditions that require lifelong monitoring and treatment, and costs can quickly add up without pet health insurance protection. Before choosing a senior pet with special needs or costly chronic conditions, decide precisely how much you can allocate toward their care rather than financially overextending yourself.

## #3: Consider your household’s lifestyle before adopting a senior pet

Is your home chaotic and possibly stressful for a mellow senior pet simply looking for a place to rest and relax? If your home is packed with many young pets and children who are all vying for your attention and take up most of your time—and rarely provide a calm, quiet area—a senior pet may not do well there. On the other hand, a senior pet would fit perfectly in a home with many places where they can quietly relax undisturbed, and their owner has plenty of time to devote to their care. Of course, the senior pet’s personality is also essential—some are social butterflies who enjoy the hubbub of a packed house, while others may become grumpy in crowded situations. Evaluate your home life carefully, and then choose a senior pet with a matching personality. 

## #4: Decide how much medical care you can handle for a senior pet

Senior pets can develop many health issues requiring substantial monitoring and treatment. You should consider not only your budget but also the time and effort you can spend treating and caring for a senior pet with a challenging chronic condition. For example, providing a good quality of life for an elderly cat with concurrent renal disease and diabetes requires a dedicated family.

## #5: Understand that you may lose a senior pet soon after adoption

Perhaps the most important aspect of adopting a senior pet is knowing that they have a much shorter life expectancy with you than a puppy or kitten. Your new elderly companion has already lived most of their life, and losing them soon after adoption, whether from a debilitating disease or because their time has simply come, can be heartbreaking. When adopting a senior pet, consider the emotional investment and understand your new companion may not be in your life for long.

Although senior pets are often overlooked in animal shelters and rescues, they offer plenty of love and life.
