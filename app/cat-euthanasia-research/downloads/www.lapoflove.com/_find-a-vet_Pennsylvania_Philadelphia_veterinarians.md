#### About Dr. Lucy Astor

I am originally from the Jersey Shore and, as many kids do, I grew up wanting to be a Veterinarian. Once I got to high school, though, I became interested in human geriatric medicine, so I started my college career at NYU as a pre-med student. During college, I realized my one true passion was in the veterinary field. I transferred to the University of Maryland College Park to major in Animal Science and then went on to obtain my degree in Veterinary Medicine at the University of Minnesota in St. Paul. It’s exactly what I was meant to do.

Immediately following veterinary school, I completed a rotating general internship and a specialty internship in Internal Medicine at Garden State Veterinary Specialists. It was there that I met my incredible husband, and we (and our combined five cats!) started a fantastic journey together that would take us to Florida, Chicago, New York City, and eventually landing happily in the Philly suburbs. Along the way, we heartbreakingly had to say goodbye to three of our loving cats but also joyously welcomed three beautiful (human) babies into our home. 

While working in Emergency Medicine, I discovered my interest in veterinary hospice and end-of life care. The experience of connecting with families to assist them and their beloved companions during such an emotional time was beyond rewarding. It made me realize how passionate I am about being able to help guide pets and families through the difficult journey of saying goodbye. It moved me to join Lap of Love, where I am honored to provide this care to you and your family.

Taking care of three young boys and two geriatric kitties leaves little time for hobbies, but in my precious spare time, you’ll find me cooking, working out, or at the shore.

#### About Dr. Nadira Williams

𝅘𝅥𝅮In West Philadelphia, born and raised𝅘𝅥𝅮 (The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air fans can appreciate this.) Growing up in Pennsylvania, I was surrounded by pet cats, dogs, and a turtle who lived for 10 years. I began helping animals at a young age and officially decided I would become a veterinarian at 5 years old, after finding an abandoned baby bird in our backyard and nursing it back to health. My love for animals and affinity for all things STEM—I’m a self-proclaimed math and science nerd—solidified my decision to pursue a career in veterinary medicine. 

I earned my bachelor’s degree in laboratory animal science from North Carolina A&T State University and completed veterinary school at the University of Pennsylvania. I’ve followed a bit of an alternative path in veterinary medicine, and my first job after receiving my VMD was in the federal regulatory sector. I’ve also spent time practicing preventative small animal medicine at community vaccine clinics. No matter what area of veterinary medicine I’m working in, I enjoy helping animals and connecting with the people who love them.

I know firsthand how difficult a pet’s passing can be. It truly feels like you’re losing a family member. Before I began working for Lap of Love, I used their services to say goodbye to my own cat, Miss Marbles. It was my first experience with in-home end-of-life care, and it was the best decision I could have made. The veterinarian was caring, professional, and supportive, and it meant so much to me that Miss Marbles passed peacefully at home, surrounded by her family. Now that I’m a part of the Lap of Love team, I like knowing I can create this same experience for other families by providing a peaceful and dignified passing for their beloved pets. 

When I’m not working, I enjoy traveling and experiencing new cultures, listening to music, and watching a good television series—I consider myself a bit of a TV show buff. I also enjoy reading, spending time in nature, watching sports—I’m a diehard Eagles fan—cooking, playing trivia, and spending time with friends and family, including my two cats, Deuce and Chloe. I’ve recently begun meditating and strength training, and they are both wonderful forms of self-care.

#### About Dr. Abby Frerotte

I grew up all over the country. My family moved around a lot when I was younger, and we lived in six different states before settling in Saint Louis, Missouri for my high school years. My parents later moved back to Pittsburgh, their hometown, and I now consider Pittsburgh my hometown.

I’ve known I wanted to be a vet since I was a few years old. My grandma owned a farm and I inherited her deep love of animals. My dad always tells the story of my shadowing a vet when I was 13 years old. I was splattered in blood from watching surgery all day, but I had the biggest smile on my face. I feel so grateful that I’ve been so sure of my career path my entire life. 

I attended Haverford College, outside of Philadelphia, for my undergraduate education and the University of Pennsylvania for vet school. I enjoy all aspects of veterinary medicine and truly love the variety that the field brings. My favorite part of being a vet is the relationships I build with owners and being able to see pets improve or, at least, ease their suffering. 

My family always had multiple dogs, so I have personally experienced many losses. We had a great relationship with our primary vet, who would come to our house to help us say goodbye. That always meant so much to me because it was such a peaceful and loving experience and not stressful for our pets.

As a veterinarian and a pet lover, I believe the ability to give our pets a peaceful passing and limit suffering is such a gift. Some of the best relationships I have made with pet parents are when I’m helping them understand their pet’s quality of life and make the difficult decision to say goodbye. I feel honored to be able to provide this service for owners and pets. 

When I’m not helping pets and their families, I love to read, bake, do pilates, hike with my boyfriend and our four dogs, and try new restaurants!

#### About Dr. Adam Link

I grew up in Los Angeles, California, and decided at a young age that I was going to become a doctor. However, as I grew older and high school was ending, I realized becoming a physician didn’t feel right. I had always loved animals and still found medical science fascinating, but for some reason, the idea of being a veterinarian had never crossed my mind. Then, while researching colleges, I came across the field of animal science and everything clicked. I received my bachelor’s degree in animal science at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo in 2012. I went on to Washington State University, College of Veterinary Medicine, and graduated with my veterinary degree in 2016. 

After veterinary school, I acquired a small animal internship position in Sacramento, California and then practiced emergency medicine in my hometown of Los Angeles. After several years, I decided I needed a change of pace, so I started traveling the country and eventually made my new home in Philadelphia in 2022. 

Counseling families about their pets’ quality of life and end-of-life care has always been one of the most rewarding aspects of this career for me. For many pet owners, hospice care and euthanasia are difficult things to make decisions about during an unexpected vet visit, so I would often recommend in-home care. Now, with Lap of Love, I’m able to help families and pets in their most comfortable environment, which is an invaluable service I greatly appreciate and respect. 

#### About Dr. Katelyn Perez

I was born and raised in Miami, Florida, by Cuban American parents. I was passionate about animals from a young age, and often wheeled my cat around in a stroller. In high school, I worked part-time at a dog training facility and then shadowed at a local veterinary hospital. I fell in love with the veterinary field and was elated when I realized I could make a career working with animals. 

I completed a bachelor’s degree in animal science at the University of Florida and went to veterinary school at the University of Pennsylvania. 

My first year as a veterinarian, I worked as a shelter veterinarian, and I currently work as a general practitioner and urgent care veterinarian. I am passionate about feline medicine, emergency medicine, pain management and end of life/palliative care. One of the things I love most about being a veterinarian is educating families and working with them to ensure they are comfortable and confident about their pets’ care. 

My German shepherd suffered from severe arthritis, and when walking became difficult, I knew I had to consider his quality of life. A close friend performed the euthanasia in my home, and I was deeply grateful that he was able to stay in the comfort of his own bed during his final moments.

Deciding to euthanize a pet is a vulnerable moment in the human-animal bond, and helping everyone involved be at peace is important to me. I love offering compassion in a moment when someone needs it the most.

Outside of work, I enjoy going to the beach, hiking, checking out wineries, reading, and spending time with friends and family.
