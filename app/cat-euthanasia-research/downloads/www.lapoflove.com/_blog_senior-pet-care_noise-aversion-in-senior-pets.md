Pets of all ages can suffer from noise aversion, which is the fear of startling or loud sounds. Most commonly, pets with noise aversion are terrified of such booming sounds as thunderstorms and fireworks, but they can also be afraid of vacuums, construction noise, loud sounds on the TV, yelling children, and other everyday noises. As your pet ages, they may not only become fearful of sounds that never bothered them before, but their current noise fears may also become worse. Help your senior pet cope with their anxiety over harsh sounds by learning more about noise aversion.

## What are noise aversion signs in senior pets?

Although your senior pet may not be able to hear as well as they could, they can still suffer from anxiety triggered by loud, startling sounds. Noise aversion signs vary, as each pet displays stress and anxiety differently, but common signs include:

* Heavy panting

* Excessive drooling

* Vocalization (e.g., whining, whimpering, howling)

* Pacing

* Trembling

* Seeking attention

* Hiding

* Uncontrolled urination or defecation

* Attempting to escape

* Destructive behaviors

Some of these signs may be seen with other conditions, which can indicate an underlying problem, so contact your family veterinarian for an appointment. 

## Why does my senior pet seem more scared of noises now?

Cognitive dysfunction is common in senior pets, who may show many of the same signs with cognitive disorders and noise aversion. As your pet ages and possibly develops cognitive dysfunction, they may also suffer from anxiety, which can be made worse with loud, unsettling sounds. The key to differentiating between cognitive dysfunction and noise aversion is studying the situation for the presence of sound triggers.

## What can I do to manage my senior pet’s noise aversion at home?

If your senior pet has noise aversion, many methods can help ease their anxiety at home, especially if you can prepare in advance for noisy events like July Fourth or thunderstorms. The following methods can help reduce your senior pet’s noise aversion fears:

* Creating a safe spot — A quiet room is an ideal location for your senior pet’s sanctuary from loud sounds, especially one that has some soundproofing. Prepare the area with a comfortable orthopedic bed, your pet’s favorite toys, and a soft, fleece blanket. If your pet feels most secure resting in a crate, outfit their crate as their safe space.

* Applying a compression wrap — A compression wrap acts the same way as a swaddle for a newborn, applying pressure to calming points on the body. 

* Diffusing a calming pheromone — Species-specific pheromones can be diffused into your pet’s safe room or their main living area to provide an additional calming effect. Synthetic pheromones mimic the natural soothing pheromones emitted by mother dogs or cats and are most effective when they’ve been fully diffused into the environment for a couple of weeks.

* Playing white noise — White noise, or a TV or radio on at a low volume, can help block out unsettling rackets for your senior pet. 

* Offering distracting treats — A long-lasting treat can go a long way toward helping ease your pet’s worries. Your senior pet may no longer be able to chew hard treats, but many great options, such as peanut butter or a yogurt-stuffed Kong toy, are available. 

Above all, calmly reassure your senior pet. Avoid becoming anxious yourself, but act as a soothing presence by brushing, petting, or simply sitting with your pet.

## How can my veterinarian help manage my senior pet’s noise aversion?

If your senior pet shows moderate to severe noise aversion signs, despite your best at-home efforts, your family veterinarian can offer further calming measures. Anti-anxiety medications can help ease your pet’s worries, and assist with cognitive dysfunction-related anxiety. Discuss with your veterinarian whether long-term medicinal use may be beneficial.

Senior pets who suffer from noise aversion can experience a decreased quality of life, especially if they live in fear of everyday sounds. Discuss your pet’s quality of life with our [telehospice service](/our-services/telehospice) to determine whether intervention is required. If cognitive dysfunction, or another medical condition, has deteriorated your pet’s quality of life, [veterinary hospice care](/our-services/veterinary-hospice) or [in-home euthanasia](http://our-services/in-home-euthanasia) with a Lap of Love veterinarian in your area can provide a peaceful ending.
