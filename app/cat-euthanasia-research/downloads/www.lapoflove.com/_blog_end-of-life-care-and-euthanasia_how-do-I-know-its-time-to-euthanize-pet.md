Recognizing the signs that a dog or cat may be nearing the end of their life can be challenging. The decision to pursue euthanasia can feel overwhelming, but it’s often the best thing for our beloved pets. But with a mixture of good days and bad, many pet owners struggle to make the final call.

The signs that indicate it's time to euthanize your dog or cat center around quality of life—something you can objectively and subjectively assess together with your pet’s veterinary team. Overall comfort is the primary factor, but a “good” quality of life can vary for each pet. Here’s our guide on what to look for at home and how to collaborate with your primary or hospice pet care providers to ensure a peaceful end-of-life transition.

## Understanding quality-of-life assessment

When considering [end-of-life decisions](/how-will-i-know-it-is-time), quality of life is the most important factor. Signs it’s time to euthanize your pet center on their physical comfort, ability to enjoy daily activities, and mental well-being. While aging alone isn’t a reason to consider euthanasia, a steady decline in daily functioning can signal the need for further assessments or interventions. 

Veterinarians often use [quality-of-life assessment tools](/quality-of-life-assessment) to help pet owners make objective decisions during an emotionally difficult time. One widely used tool is the [HHHHHMM scale](https://www.aaha.org/resources/how-to-assess-your-senior-pets-quality-of-life/), initially designed by a veterinary oncologist. The scale addresses key areas that comprise the acronym, including hunger, hydration, hygiene, happiness, mobility, and whether your pet is experiencing more good days than bad. 

The Lap of Love team offers a shorter, more focused quality-of-life scale to help pet owners become aware of the factors that contribute to their pet's quality of life. The scale addresses the following:

\- Social function

\- Health

\- Mental health

\- Natural functions (e.g., eating, drinking)

\- Family concerns/perceptions about the pet

It can be helpful to use more than one scale together or try a few to determine which one works best for you. Then, use the scale regularly and go over results with your veterinarian to discuss the best ways to combat concerns and when euthanasia becomes the best option.

Quality-of-life assessment allows pet owners to step back and view the bigger picture. It helps shift the focus from “How long do we have left?” to “How well is my pet living today?” If your pet is no longer interested in food, struggles to walk, can’t stay clean, or seems persistently uncomfortable, their quality of life may be poor. 

Additional factors, such as a pet's ability to perform their favorite activities, can influence how you weigh other factors in the scale. For example, a ball-obsessed pet who can no longer play ball—even at a reduced speed—might have a low quality of life, despite eating well. Individual assessment and discussions with veterinary professionals are critical.

## Key physical indicators of decline

Many of the signs it’s time to euthanize your pet are physical. Understanding what to look for can help you recognize when your pet is suffering. Here are a few of the main issues:

* Pain and discomfort

Pain can arise from many sources, including joint diseases, abdominal organ conditions, or [dental](/blog/senior-pet-care/4-reasons-for-senior-pet-dental-care) disease. Pets may show pain through obvious limping or hunched posture, but it could also present subtly over time. Some pets become restless, clingy, or isolated, while others may pant excessively or simply rest more than usual. 

* [Appetite](/blog/senior-pet-care/why-has-my-senior-pets-appetite-changed) and hydration

A pet that consistently refuses to eat or drink may be suffering from nausea, organ failure, or pain that interferes with basic functioning. Other pets may continue to eat or drink but battle dehydration and weight or muscle loss because of a chronic disease that impacts their metabolism.

* [Mobility](/blog/senior-pet-care/helping-pets-with-mobility-challenges) changes

Dogs and cats suffering from mobility issues may have painful arthritis or a less painful neurological condition. Either way, reduced mobility can interfere with their ability to go places they once enjoyed or to perform basic daily tasks, such as urinating and defecating. Falls are common in pets with mobility concerns.

* [Incontinence](/blog/common-pet-diseases-and-symptoms/5-ways-to-care-for-a-pet-with-urinary-incontinence) and hygiene problems

Pets nearing the end of life may lose control of their bladder or bowel because of neurologic or orthopedic issues. Not being clean or able to groom themselves can cause discomfort and lead to skin or bladder infections.

* [Breathing](http://blog/senior-pet-care/5-reasons-why-your-senior-dog-is-panting) difficulties

Labored breathing, wheezing, or increased effort to expand the chest are urgent signs that your pet may be distressed. If the breathing issue is not treatable, prompt euthanasia may be the kindest option.

## Behavioral changes

Signs it’s time to euthanize your dog or cat may include behavioral and emotional changes. These changes can be subtle or dramatic, and may result from cognitive decline (i.e., dementia), physical concerns, or a combination. Things to watch for include:

* Social withdrawal

Once-social pets may [isolate themselves](/blog/senior-pet-care/senior-pet-socialization-companionship), choosing to rest in closets, under beds, or in corners where they’re less likely to be disturbed. Some pets stop responding to familiar voices or no longer seek affection. Others may show confusion, pacing, or disorientation.

* Changes in sleep patterns

Affected pets may sleep much more than usual, struggle to get restful sleep, or sleep during the day and stay up at night. Profound fatigue or discomfort can cause excessive sleep, which can appear as a loss of interest in toys, walks, playtime, or visitors.

* Emotional changes

Older pets may experience [anxiety](/blog/senior-pet-care/senior-pet-anxiety-tips) or agitation, which is often expressed as increased vocalization, including whining, howling, or groaning, particularly at night. They might also react differently to situations they once enjoyed, such as car rides, walks, or interactions with visitors and other pets.

## Tackling quality-of-life issues

Simply identifying a declining quality of life doesn’t mean that it’s time to euthanize your pet. However, it does mean that interventions are required to keep them comfortable and happy. When interventions are not effective or a pet’s condition worsens, then euthanasia may be the best option to relieve suffering.

For example, you can make changes to your home, purchase mobility devices, and provide pain medications or therapy for pets with joint disease that limits their mobility. Pets suffering from anxiety, sleep problems, or confusion may improve with medications. What’s possible depends on how the pet responds to interventions and the family’s ability to provide care and assistance in various forms.

## When to consult a veterinarian

Check in with your veterinary team if you notice any changes in your pet’s physical or mental well-being. Although specific changes are commonly associated with aging, that doesn’t mean you should ignore them or consider them “normal”. Avoid waiting for an emergency or for your pet to be in apparent agony to discuss your concerns.

Veterinarians familiar with pet end-of-life signs and hospice care can assess your pet’s physical and emotional well-being, explain how symptoms might worsen over time, and help you determine whether palliative care—treatments aimed at reducing pain or discomfort—is an option. Veterinary professionals provide a unique perspective that complements yours and can help you determine if your pet is showing signs it’s time to euthanize. 

## Making a compassionate decision

Recognizing the signs it’s time to euthanize a dog or cat is challenging for most pet owners, but understanding what to look for can make it easier. When pets can no longer enjoy life or find relief from discomfort, euthanasia becomes a final gift to alleviate suffering. Assessing quality of life and identifying signs of decline are the first steps in your pet’s end-of-life journey.
