As your pet ages, you may question their need for routine medical care, such as vaccines and dental cleanings. But this is no time to relinquish your pet’s vital health care. Older pets need regular preventive care as much as, if not more, than their younger counterparts, since they are at higher risk of developing[age-related diseases](/resource-center/common-diseases-in-dogs). [Dental disease](/blog/senior-pet-care/dental-disease-in-senior-pets) affects far more than your pet’s mouth and can steal precious time with your beloved companion. Still skeptical? Here are four reasons dental care should be part of your senior pet’s regular health care routine.

## #1: Dental disease is a common pain source in older pets

[Dental disease](/blog/senior-pet-care/dental-disease-in-senior-pets) develops when oral bacteria deposit a sticky plaque on your pet’s teeth that hardens to tartar. Over time, tartar builds up on the visible parts of your pet’s teeth and beneath the gum line. Subgingival plaque and tartar cause the ligaments that attach your pet’s teeth to the surrounding bone to deteriorate and their teeth to become loose. Additionally, bacteria-laden tartar can cause painful tooth root infections that lead to tooth decay. 

As you can imagine, tooth root infections and loose teeth are excruciating for pets—if you have ever had a toothache, you know how painful dental disease can be. Unfortunately, pets often hide pain so well that their owners are unaware they are suffering. And the instinct to survive is so deeply rooted that many pets eat despite painful teeth. If your senior pet has bad breath or tartar accumulation, dental pain may affect their quality of life despite a normal appetite. Regular dental cleanings are critical to stop dental disease from progressing and causing painful dental problems.

## #2: Oral bacteria are not limited to your pet’s mouth

Bacteria buried under layers of plaque don’t sit idly by but instead, look for opportunities to migrate to other body areas. Unfortunately, oral bacteria can travel through the bloodstream to your pet’s [heart](/resource-center/common-diseases-in-dogs/heart-disease), [kidneys](http://resource-center/common-diseases-in-dogs/chronic-kidney-disease), brain, and [liver](/resource-center/common-diseases-in-dogs/liver-disease) and cause serious complications. For example, they are a common cause of endocarditis, which develops when bacteria form a thick plaque on a pet’s heart valve. The kidneys can damage the glomerular membrane, interfering with blood-filtering capabilities. And oral bacteria have been implicated in cerebral infarctions (i.e., strokes), which can lead to cognitive decline. Regular dental care eliminates tartar, effectively removing the bacteria source.

## #3: Feline odontoclastic resorptive lesions are common in older cats

Feline odontoclastic resorptive lesions (FORLs) are areas of tooth resorption, similar to human cavities, that develop in cats. Up to 75% of cats are believed likely to have FORLs, which are extremely painful. Yet, because cats are masters at hiding pain, they rarely complain until oral pain becomes unbearable and they can no longer eat. Regular dental exams and cleanings can help your family veterinarian detect FORLS in their early stages before your cat suffers needlessly. FORLs resist treatment, and affected teeth require extraction to eliminate the pain source.

## #4: Dental disease can affect your senior pet’s quality of life

Your senior pet’s [quality of life](/quality-of-life-assessment) is undoubtedly your top concern. Unfortunately, dental disease can severely impact your pet’s health and happiness and cause significant discomfort. Dental pain and tooth loss can make eating difficult, while an oral infection can cause generalized weakness and debilitation. Also, bad breath associated with dental disease can rob you and your pet of necessary bonding time if you avoid snuggle sessions and sloppy kisses. Lifelong dental care can add years to your pet’s life, which makes this choice a no-brainer.
