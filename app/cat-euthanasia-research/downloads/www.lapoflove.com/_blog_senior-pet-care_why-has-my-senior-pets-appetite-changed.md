Senior pets typically make many changes, from different behaviors to mobility issues, that may be concerning. If your senior pet is leaving their food bowl partly full or has suddenly developed a ravenous appetite, their appetite change could be caused by various factors. As your senior pet’s caregiver, you want to act quickly when a concerning change arises to ensure your pet has no serious medical condition. An appetite change always warrants visiting your family veterinarian, who can help resolve the issue. While you prepare for your pet’s veterinary visit, consider these four possible causes.

## #1: Your senior pet can no longer easily access their food

As your pet ages, their likelihood of developing mobility issues drastically increases. One study found that approximately 90% of senior cats have osteoarthritis, and veterinarians believe most older dogs are also affected. While arthritis causes pain, which can impact your pet’s appetite, your pet may be hungry but unable to get to their food. If your pet has arthritis, walking up or down stairs and navigating slippery floors may be too difficult, and they may forgo their dinner. To help your senior pet with mobility issues, place food and water bowls in easily accessible locations on each home level.

## #2: Your senior pet has dental disease

Have you lifted your senior pet’s lip lately? All pets are susceptible to dental disease, affecting 80% of cats and dogs over three years of age. If your pet has not received regular professional dental care, they may have years—or a lifetime’s—worth of dental disease built up since their third birthday passed many years ago. Dental disease leads to painful root infections and tooth decay, loosening, and loss. Although pets have deep-rooted survival instincts that often make them eat despite the pain, your pet may stop eating if they can no longer handle their discomfort. 

Other signs your pet may be suffering from painful dental disease include:

* Tartar accumulation on tooth surfaces

* Bad breath

* Dropping food while eating

* Resisting being touched near the face

* Loose or missing teeth

* Blood in their water or food bowl

Dental disease is best prevented early, but if your senior pet’s teeth have gone without care, your family veterinarian can devise a plan to improve their dental health and eliminate their pain.

## #3: Your senior pet has cognitive dysfunction

[Cognitive dysfunction](/resource-center/common-diseases-in-dogs/cognitive-dysfunction) is an age-related decline in cognitive function similar to dementia or Alzheimer’s disease in people. The condition affects more than 50% of geriatric dogs and cats and becomes increasingly likely as your pet ages. Cognitive dysfunction is characterized by abnormal behavior changes, including:

* Decreased appetite

* Disorientation

* Confusion

* Decreased interactions with people and other pets

* Altered sleep/wake cycles, typically with night-time restlessness 

* House soiling

* Increased anxiety

If your pet has cognitive dysfunctions signs, discuss their situation with your family veterinarian. Many people attribute the changes to normal aging, but cognitive dysfunction is an abnormal medical condition that can be treated and possibly improve your pet’s appetite and quality of life.

## #4: Your senior pet has a systemic disease

Your appetite likely diminishes when you don’t feel well, and your senior pet is the same. Systemic diseases, such as kidney or liver failure, heart disease, diabetes, and cancer, become increasingly likely as your pet ages and may affect their appetite. Other diseases, such as arthritis, dental disease, and some cancers, cause pain that can lead to inappetence. A decreased appetite is often the first sign that your pet is not well and requires veterinary care.

Although only a few illnesses cause an increased appetite, hyperthyroidism, common in middle-aged and older cats, accelerates metabolism. Affected cats often lose weight, despite scarfing down their dinner and crying for more.

If your senior pet no longer has an appetite, consider supporting them with [veterinary hospice care](/our-services/veterinary-hospice). Our [telehospice service](/our-services/telehospice) can help you evaluate your pet’s quality of life and make important choices about their final days, including planning for [in-home euthanasia](/our-services/in-home-euthanasia).
