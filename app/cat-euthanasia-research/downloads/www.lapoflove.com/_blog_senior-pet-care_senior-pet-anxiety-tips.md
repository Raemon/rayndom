Anxiety can affect pets of all ages, but the problem begins or worsens for some dogs and cats when they reach their senior years. Understanding why anxiety plagues pets in their golden years can help you find ways to alleviate their distress, improve quality of life, and preserve the bond you share. Here’s a look at senior pet anxiety, how it impacts older pets, and how you can help your furry pal feel their best.

## What is anxiety in pets?

Anxiety is a state of unease or worry, usually caused by the anticipation of an adverse event, whether real or imagined. Fear, anxiety, and stress can impact your pet’s overall well-being, especially when they become chronic conditions. Pets can experience generalized anxiety, which is present to some degree all the time, or situational anxiety, which is a response to a specific trigger, such as a thunderstorm, interaction with a stranger, or a painful veterinary experience. Anxious pets typically take some time to recover from a triggering event.

## Recognizing senior pet anxiety

Anxiety presents differently in different pets and senior animals compared to younger pets. Look for changes, particularly the following, in your pet’s behavior:

* Restlessness or pacing

* Unusual vocalization

* Trembling or cowering

* Clinginess or withdrawal

* Destructive behavior 

* [House soiling](/blog/senior-pet-care/house-soiling-in-senior-dogs)

* Appetite loss

* Overgrooming 

Senior pet anxiety signs can overlap with many other health and behavioral problems, so a diagnosis can be more challenging. Contact your veterinarian if you notice any concerning changes in your pet’s behavior, patterns, or attitude.

## Why anxiety increases with age

Physical and emotional changes associated with aging can cause anxiety in some senior pets or make them more sensitive to situational anxiety triggers. In many cases, the cause is multifactorial. Some possible contributing factors include:

* Cognitive dysfunction — [Cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CDS)](/blog/common-pet-diseases-and-symptoms/tips-for-pets-showing-cognitive-decline) in pets is similar to Alzheimer’s in humans, causing confusion and memory loss. Pets with CDS may be easily startled, lose their sense of routine, and forget people or places, leading to anxiety.

* Sensory decline — Because of age-related declines in vision and [hearing](/blog/senior-pet-care/noise-aversion-in-senior-pets), some pets can lose confidence and begin worrying about people or objects “sneaking up” on them. 

* Chronic health issues — [Painful conditions](/blog/senior-pet-care/is-my-senior-pet-in-pain), such as arthritis or [dental disease](/blog/senior-pet-care/dental-disease-in-senior-pets), can lead to discomfort, general irritability, and anxiety. Some health conditions that alter metabolic rate or hormone levels can also cause anxiety. 

## Managing senior pet anxiety

Senior pet anxiety is treatable with various medical and behavioral interventions. However, although you can address underlying medical issues to improve anxiety, you may also need other strategies to maintain your aging companion’s optimal mental health. Ask your veterinarian if the following could help:

* Calming environment — Senior pets feel secure if you set up a familiar, calming, cozy atmosphere with their comfort in mind. Promote relaxation in your pet’s area with soft bedding, soothing music or white noise, and a pheromone diffuser.

* Predictable schedule — Teach pets what to expect each day with consistent feeding, walking, sleeping, and waking times. Avoid deviations from the routine, which can be upsetting for seniors.

* Mental and physical stimulation — Mental and physical activity helps keep your pet’s body and mind sharp. Short walks, controlled play, interactive toys, and training sessions will keep them engaged and entertained.

* Calming aids — Anxiety wraps, pheromone collars, and calming supplements may help reduce anxiety in some senior pets. Use them consistently and combine products to achieve a lasting effect.

* Behavior modifications — A professional trainer or veterinary behaviorist can assess your pet and develop training techniques to overcome specific anxiety triggers, fears, or phobias that have appeared or worsened during your pet’s senior years. Desensitization and counterconditioning can also help your pet build positive associations with people, places, pets, or stressful situations.

* Prescription medications — Prescription anti-anxiety medications or calming diets can help pets suffering from general anxiety or cognitive decline. Medications are most effective when used in conjunction with other strategies.

Senior pet anxiety can be frustrating for pet owners to handle on their own. Work with your primary veterinarian, who can help you find the reasons for your pet’s anxiety and develop a treatment plan that will reduce their discomfort and increase enjoyment in their golden years.
