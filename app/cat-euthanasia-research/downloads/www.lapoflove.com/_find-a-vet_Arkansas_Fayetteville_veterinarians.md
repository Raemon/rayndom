#### About Dr. Mike Stanford

I grew up in Sandwich, Massachusetts, a historic, small town on Cape Cod, where my parents owned an ice cream shop and rental cottages. I’ve always loved animals and spending time outdoors, which made veterinary medicine a natural fit. 

While attending Virginia Intermont College, I took several equestrian classes taught by Dr. Jake Haught, a local large animal veterinarian. I was fascinated by the work he did and was inspired to follow a similar path. After graduating and completing my pre-requisite courses at Virginia Commonwealth University, I attended the Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, where I received my veterinary degree.

I worked as an ambulatory equine and small animal veterinarian for 25 years during which time I became interested in utilizing complementary and alternative therapies, such as acupuncture, traditional Chinese medicine, and chiropractic care, to improve the quality of life for my patients.

In college, I had a Siberian husky who was my constant companion for 16 years. As she aged, her body weakened, and she lost her sight, hearing, and—eventually—her mobility. These changes happened slowly, and I didn’t realize how much her quality of life had diminished until she was completely dependent on me. I knew it was time to let her go, and on a warm, sunny day, I helped her pass while she lay in my lap in the front yard. This experience taught me how important it is to ensure our pets enjoy a good quality of life and provide them with appropriate end-of-life care. 

I am passionate about advocating for animals and helping families navigate their pet’s end-of-life care, and I feel fortunate to be able to provide this support through my role at Lap of Love.

Outside of work, I’m an avid long-distance motorcyclist and have toured 49 US states and various Canadian provinces and territories with my wife. I’m also an amateur potter, woodworker, camper, and back-packer. I love spending time with my wife, daughter, and grandchildren, as well as our rescue Pitbull terrier, Ash, and our Peterbald cats, Albert and Kianu.
