________

Euthanizing a pet is an emotionally complex experience. It’s not about the final moment, but the memories, love, and bond built over the years. For Emily, who lives in Denver, Colorado, that bond was with Molly, a feisty shih tzu who had been by her side for more than 15 years.

Molly was Emily’s first dog as an adult, a constant through life’s changes, and the reason Emily fell in love with little dogs. “I still have the first little chew bone we ever got her,” Emily recalled with nostalgia.

When it came time to say goodbye, Emily wanted something different from her previous experiences as a pet owner and a veterinary hospital employee. She knew of in-home euthanasia because of her experience in the veterinary industry and through her sister, Sarah, so she turned to Lap of Love to give Molly the goodbye they both deserved.

## Emily and Molly: A lifetime of love

Emily got Molly when she was in her twenties. Emily and her ex-partner worked at a restaurant together, and a coworker mentioned their dog had just had puppies. “We said, ‘Oh, let’s just go look!’ We didn’t plan on taking one home, but that’s what happened,” Emily remembered. “We picked Molly because she had black and brown spots, and her brother was all white.” That simple decision shaped the next 15 years of Emily’s life.

Molly was Emily’s shadow and adventure partner. “She was feisty,” Emily admitted of Molly’s big personality. She accompanied Emily during a big move from Illinois to Denver and remained a steady presence in her life. [Emily’s bond with Molly](/blog/senior-pet-care/5-ways-to-strengthen-your-bond-with-your-senior-pet) was so strong that she had Molly’s face tattooed on her wrist. “She’s on me forever,” Emily said, a testament to her deep appreciation for Molly’s companionship and loyalty.

## How Emily knew it was time

Molly was [healthy for most of her life](/blog/common-pet-diseases-and-symptoms/top-5-senior-pet-health-concerns), but as she neared 16 years old, she developed pulmonary hypertension. The coughing kept her up at night as it worsened, and Emily [knew the end was near](/blog/pet-loss-support/navigating-anticipatory-grief). Although Molly was Emily’s first dog, she had cared for many other dogs with her family and through her involvement in rescue work. One of those dogs was Annie.

Annie, a shih tzu who also had pulmonary hypertension, spent her final days in the ICU. “They called us at 2 a.m. saying they were doing CPR, and I will never forgive myself for letting that be her last day,” Emily recalled.

She didn’t want Molly’s story to end the same way—rushed to an emergency room in distress or hospitalized and surrounded by strangers. Emily’s sister, Sarah, shared advice that stuck with her: It’s better to euthanize a week too soon than [a day too late.](/blog/pet-loss-support/overcoming-guilt-after-losing-your-pet)

When Molly, who had always been an enthusiastic eater, refused her favorite McDonald’s cheeseburger, [Emily knew it was time](/blog/end-of-life-care-and-euthanasia/how-will-I-know-its-time-to-say-goodbye). “She had never had issues with her appetite in her whole life,” Emily said. That moment, small but significant, told her that Molly was ready.

## Molly’s last day

Emily wanted Molly’s last day to be packed with everything she loved. It was October, and the weather couldn’t have been better. “It was a beautiful fall day,” Emily remembered with a sense of nostalgia.

They started the day with a car ride, one of Molly’s favorite activities. Molly had always loved the feeling of the wind on her face as she leaned out the window. Molly wasn’t up for the walk Emily had initially planned, so they enjoyed the ride and the crisp fall air together instead.

Later, they returned home and rested together on the balcony, soaking up the peacefulness of the day. Emily contacted Lap of Love and arranged for the euthanasia to take place at Cheeseman Park, a spot two blocks from her home, where she and Molly loved to spend time. They met Sarah there, and the Lap of Love veterinarian joined them beneath the trees.

“It couldn’t have been a more peaceful experience,” Emily said, acknowledging that although the day was difficult overall, it was the best it could have been. True to Molly’s nature, she put up a bit of a fight for the first injection. Emily smiled and laughed as she recalled the moment, knowing it was an expression of the lively spirit Molly carried.

The Lap of Love veterinarian brought a small basket and offered to carry Molly in it, but Emily chose to hold her one last time. Afterward, Emily took home a nose print and received a thoughtful poem via email. Molly’s last day was the kind of goodbye Emily wanted—filled with love, surrounded by friends, and in a place that held memories for both of them.

## Grief, acceptance, and healing

After Molly’s passing, Emily [braced herself for the grief](/blog/pet-loss-support/finding-peace-and-friendship-after-pet-loss) she knew would follow. Molly had been a constant companion for almost half her life, but she noticed something unexpected: she felt more at peace than she had after previous losses. The grief was still there, but it wasn’t as overwhelming.

“I think having a last peaceful day with Molly helped my grieving process,” Emily reflected. That day—the car ride, the nap on the balcony, the visit to Cheeseman Park—gave her a sense of closure. She wasn’t haunted by thinking about what she could have done differently.

Her friends and family also noticed the difference. “My sister and one of my close friends said, ‘You’re taking this a lot better than expected,’” Emily recounted. Although she described herself as emotional, especially regarding her dogs, Emily knew why. A better euthanasia experience didn’t erase her pain, but it softened the edges. 

## A new perspective

Saying goodbye to Molly on their terms was a wholly different experience for Emily. “There’s something about being in your atmosphere,” she said. The setting helped ease her emotional pain and created a memory she knew she could look back on with a smile.

Molly always hated going to the vet, so spending her final moments in a clinic wasn’t the right choice for her family. In-home euthanasia offers control over the pet euthanasia process. For some families, that might mean a quiet afternoon at home with their pet curled up on a favorite blanket. For others, like Emily, it might mean a final visit to the park.

Many pet owners see euthanasia as inherently negative, but it doesn’t have to be. You have options for when, where, and how you’d like to say goodbye, and you can craft an experience that creates a meaningful, lasting, and surprisingly positive memory. In-home euthanasia is a gift to you and your pet.

Emily described how holding Molly in her arms throughout the pet euthanasia process helped her feel connected and present. Having the option to carry Molly to the car afterward, receiving a thoughtful follow-up email from the veterinarian, and knowing she could take her time made an objectively sad experience better.

In-home euthanasia may not be the right choice for everyone. But for pets like Molly, who found vet visits stressful, in-home euthanasia was ideal. “It’s never a fun situation, but this was the best it could have been,” said Emily.
