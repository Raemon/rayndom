#### About Dr. Dan Genatiempo

I grew up in northeastern Indiana, and knew from the time I was in high school that I was going to be a veterinarian. After completing my undergraduate work at Butler University I spent two years working toward a master's degree in veterinary microbiology at Texas A&M University. I completed my DVM at Texas A&M in 2003. After returning to the Indianapolis area I spent one year in a private practice internship and nearly 12 years in small animal private practice before dedicating my services to end of life care. 

During my years in private practice I discovered that I had an aptitude for end of life care and euthanasia. Many clients have told me that they feel it must be the most difficult part of being a veterinarian. My response has always been that it's all about how you view it. I have always viewed it as an opportunity to allow an animal to pass peacefully and comfortably, a final gift of kindness to them.

#### About Dr. Amy Czarnecki

I grew up in rural Michigan surrounded by pets of all kind. I always knew that animals would be a large part of my life, but my fate was cemented when I volunteered at a small animal clinic while attending Albion College. Upon graduation from Michigan State University College of Veterinary Medicine in 2003, my husband and I started our migration south - first spending several years in the Washington D.C. area and then settling in Savannah, Georgia for 12 years to raise our family. We returned to our Midwestern roots in the summer of 2019. I have always loved medicine- my areas of special interest include dentistry/oral surgery, internal medicine, geriatric medicine and hospice care. I am particularly passionate about client education and fostering a team approach with owners when it comes to patient care. 

During my many years in private practice, I realized that providing peace with dignity at the end of a beloved animal’s life was something that I believed strongly in; protecting the “human-animal bond” from beginning to end is my priority. Having lost one of the great loves of my life several years ago, I found such peace in being able to say goodbye in our backyard beneath her favorite tree; she was surrounded by her family in a place she loved. I will always hold this memory in my heart and have dedicated myself to help others find the same comfort when they make that most selfless decision of all to let a loved one go. I am always humbled when a family allows me to be a part of this final moment and am thankful to be able to serve them in this way. 

I love this poem written by my daughter (then age 10) after we let our beloved Maizy go. This is what it is all about- my daughter will forever have this special memory of getting to be a part of this beautiful circle of life. 

“Letting Go”- by Addyson Czarnecki 

My mood was dark that summer day 

She got too old to even play 

My heart ached as I drew her near 

All I wanted was to ease her fear 

On a blanket under her favorite tree 

We made the choice to set her free 

I buried my face in her soft, orange fur 

I had never known my life without her 

As minutes passed her heart began to slow 

It was so hard to finally let her go 

I sat there in silence, not knowing what to say 

Then my dad gently picked her up and carried her away 

I know she is at peace now up above 

My sweet old Maizy will never lose my love 

#### About Dr. Emily Yau

I was born in Monterey, California and grew up in Towson, Maryland. I have always had an interest in working with animals, and during my schooling I spent many summers exploring various veterinary-related careers, including the zoo, wildlife centers, and private practices.

After completing my undergraduate degree at Tufts University in Massachusetts, and obtaining my veterinary degree at the University of Pennsylvania, I discovered that working with companion animals and their families was my passion. 

I returned to Maryland after completing veterinary school and worked as a general practitioner for many years, co-owning my own practice for seven. During my time as a general practitioner, I assisted countless pets in their passing, aiming to make it as peaceful and dignified as possible. I always aimed to make the process go smoothly, which can be challenging in a stressful veterinary clinic environment. An unfamiliar environment often triggers stress and fear in pets, and that is the last thing I wanted my patients and their families to experience during their final moments. 

After attending lectures at a veterinary conference on in-home veterinary hospice and euthanasia, I knew I wanted to be involved in this field—I just needed the avenue. I was excited that an opportunity with Lap of Love aligned with my plan to move to Indianapolis so I officially relocated to the Midwest to join their team. It is an honor to help families and their pets with end-of-life care.

I currently share my home with three cats: Bitty, Oscar, and Tut, and enjoy spending my free time exploring bike trails, as well as experiencing new restaurants and adventures. 

#### About Dr. Cassie Smead

I grew up in a small one-stoplight town in Arkansas just outside of Little Rock. Our town was so small that it was a huge deal when we got a Sonic. I was one of those kids that always wanted to be a veterinarian. We had a lot of stray dogs that would get dropped off in our neighborhood and I always found a way to get them to follow me home and beg my parents to keep them. They never did, but we found good homes for every one of those dogs! One night at a childhood sleepover, the family’s horse got into some sweets in the dumpster and began to colic. At the time I had no idea what was happening, just that the horse was sick and somebody showed up to treat the horse and make it feel better. It was then that I remember making the decision that I wanted to be the person that came to fix the animals. That desire stuck with me and became my life goal. 

I completed my undergraduate studies at Arkansas Tech University in Russellville, Arkansas and received my bachelor's degree in agriculture business. I developed a soft spot for large animals, despite staying focused on becoming a small animal veterinarian. I married my high school sweetheart one week after graduating from ATU, and moved to Stillwater, Oklahoma the next week to attend veterinary school. 

After graduating vet school, I started a grueling rotating internship at an emergency and specialty hospital. I soon realized the stressful environment of emergency medicine was not my path, but I went on to open and run a new urgent care department.

The experience of losing my own dogs gave me the greatest insight into end-of- life-care, and specifically the variety of ways families can memorialize their pet. When my heart dog, Quiglet, was hit by a car at just 2 years old, we did not have the clarity of mind to save things like a fur clipping or paw print, or know that we could do beautiful things with his ashes if we had him cremated. I wish that I had something to remember Quigley by, and I don’t want anyone else to feel that way. Through my work at Lap of Love, I can give pets a peaceful and painless end-of life experience and provide families with support during a difficult time. 

Outside of work, I enjoy painting, especially pet portraits. I also love baking, hiking—we have a goal to visit every U.S. National Park—watching movies, and playing Catan with friends.

#### About Dr. Emma Davidsen

I grew up in the old part of downtown Noblesville in an old Victorian home that my dad and I spent our summers fixing up. My dad instilled in me a strong work ethic—and some valuable home improvement skills. I have always innately known that becoming a veterinarian was my purpose in life. My fondness for animals was evident early, and a strong inner voice told me that I could combine my love for animals and affinity for math and science by pursuing a career in veterinary medicine. 

I completed my bachelor’s degree in biology with an English minor, and then my veterinary degree at Purdue University as a third-generation Boilermaker. I also enjoyed extracurricular activities as an Alpha Omicron Pi and studying abroad in Colombia and Paris. 

I love emergency medicine and I spent the first phase of my career at an emergency and specialty hospital. My favorite cases were polytrauma and laceration repairs, but I found myself drawn to end-of-life care. I found that in an emergency room setting, I couldn't take as much time as I wanted with a pet and their family as they said goodbye. I feel that end-of-life care is a spiritual experience, and truly a celebration of the human-animal bond. 

I recently lost my heart cat, Lucky, at the age of 15. He came into my life when he was 10, with three legs and about 50% of his kidney function. We spent five blissful years falling in love with each other. Although I was only with him for his last act, I like to think he chose me for his finale. Treating his disease was the most rewarding part of my career and losing him has been the hardest, but it has affirmed that a peaceful passage can be beautiful and healing. 

Outside of work, my interests evolve with the seasons. In the spring, I enjoy napping on rainy days and then rescuing worms. In the summer, I like roller skating and growing tomatoes on my small balcony. In the fall, I love anything spooky or Halloween-related. And in the winter, I work on 1000-piece jigsaw puzzles. Year-round, I love listening to true crime and comedy podcasts, reading, crocheting, traveling, and starting art projects I’ll probably never finish.

#### About Dr. Melanie Jereb

I grew up in Cary, a suburb of Chicago. Hometown of Jimmy John himself! My entire childhood revolved around animals. Growing up, we had dogs, cats, ferrets, guinea pigs, hamsters, fish, frogs, and snails. Our home had at least 4 dogs and cats at any time and was always full of life and love. At a young age, I knew I wanted to work with animals. Our family volunteered at Heartland Animal Shelter, and we also fostered kittens and feral animals. My family spent several holidays taking care of the animals at the shelter so that other volunteers could spend time with their family. At Heartland, I especially loved working with aggressive or fearful animals and gaining their trust and love. 

I completed my undergraduate degree in Biology and Environmental Science while playing Division 1 volleyball at Creighton University. I captained the team to their first sweet 16 NCAA finish! I adopted my fur baby, Hercules, shortly after graduating from Creighton. He is specifically named after the Disney character, as it was one of my favorite childhood movies. I took two years off of school and worked full time as a veterinary assistant at a small animal hospital. For veterinary school, I attended the University of Illinois, my father’s alma mater, where I came to know more than ever that veterinary medicine was where I belonged. 

I spent the first phase of my career in general practice at a veterinary hospital that saw everything from vaccine and wellness appointments to emergency and critical care. I love being a vet because I get to help people who love animals as much as I do, and assist them with their care, even when it involves emotional or difficult decisions. 

I have counseled my own family members through the decision to say goodbye to a beloved pet. I've seen firsthand the many complicated emotions that surround the end of a pet's life. In 2021, my parents and I said goodbye to one of my childhood dogs, Desiree. My mother struggled a lot with making this final decision for Desi, and I helped her to realize when it was the right time for Desi to cross the rainbow bridge. It was a wonderful and peaceful moment in the end, with Desi surrounded with people who loved her, sitting under a tree. This is the kind of peace that I want to be able to give to all pet moms and dads.

Outside of veterinary medicine, I continue to play volleyball, enjoy camping and hiking with my dog, reading, trying new recipes, traveling, and exploring!

#### About Dr. Kristen Puls

I’m a Colorado native with a love for animals, a passion for medicine, and a desire to solve problems and serve others. As a child, I always dreamed of becoming a veterinarian and am constantly in awe of the deep and special bond we share with our pets and their incredible impact on our lives.

I received my undergraduate degree from Colorado State University. Shortly after, my husband and I moved to Indiana so we both could attend Purdue University, where I earned my Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine.

In addition to my role with Lap of Love, I work at a general practice where I wear many hats and no two days are the same. I enjoy preventive medicine, internal medicine, and geriatric care.

Over the years, I’ve developed an unexpected passion for end-of-life care, hospice, and euthanasia. I believe that stewardship of animals means advocating for their freedom from pain, fear, and struggle, including sometimes giving the gift of a peaceful death. 

I’ve experienced this personally with my own pets. As a pet parent, my desire has always been to ensure my pets pass with freedom from pain, fear, and struggle in the comfort of their own space. I believe there is something sacred in that final goodbye—the last hug, the last breath, the last heartbeat. Nothing else matters except to be present. These moments do defining work if we let them. 

As a Lap of Love veterinarian, I desire to serve others in the incredibly difficult and sacred final moments of their furry loved ones. I want to give these loyal companions the gift of freedom in the presence of their favorite people and the familiar setting of home. 

It’s an honor to come alongside families in this way.

#### About Dr. Sarah Tomasic

I grew up in Northwest Indiana, about an hour from Chicago. My story is a bit different in that, unlike many veterinarians, I didn’t know from a young age what I wanted to be. I knew that I wanted a career in medicine, but I wasn’t sure where to go from there. During a school break, I took a job as a veterinary assistant at a clinic in my hometown. Watching the veterinarians work made me realize that I wanted to be like them. 

I received my undergraduate degree from DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana, and my Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine from Purdue University. I’ve practiced small animal general medicine for more than a decade and learned that I most enjoy providing preventive care, geriatric care, hospice care, and pain management. I am certified to perform acupuncture therapy and love seeing animals improve with this uniquely effective treatment. 

I provide at-home end-of-life care services for Lap of Love because allowing pets to pass in a calm, peaceful, and comfortable environment is the greatest gift I can give to pet families. I lost my “heart cat” a few years ago. She got sick abruptly, so we said goodbye in a clinic setting, and I remember looking back and wishing that she had passed at home in her comfortable bed.

I will always choose at-home end-of-life care whenever possible for my own pets, and I am grateful to be able to provide others with the same experience. Losing a pet is hard, but I can ensure that it goes smoothly and creates a positive last memory for the family.

Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, traveling, reading, and learning to play the guitar.

#### About Dr. Corey Fruits

Growing up in rural Hendricks County, Indiana, I spent a lot of time at my grandparents' farm. I have many fond memories of tending to the cattle, chickens, and various other animals we raised over the years. I was also a 4-H member, raising and showing pigs for most of my 10 years in the program. When I wasn’t at the farm, I could often be found getting to know the regulars at the local diners, including the café my parents ran for a number of years. 

While my animal experiences led me to a career in veterinary medicine, it was people who led me to hospice care. I have always wanted to give back to the people and the community. This area of veterinary care lets me do just that.

I completed my undergraduate studies at Southern Illinois University—Carbondale, where I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Animal Science, and met my beloved wife. From there, I attended Lincoln Memorial University's College of Veterinary Medicine in the Cumberland Gap.

Though I've experienced many different facets of this career field, and have always enjoyed helping pets return to health, I find the most enjoyment and fulfillment in end-of-life care. 

There is a certain beauty in the euthanasia process, especially when performed in-home. I find that familiarity offers a higher lever of comfort for pets and pet parents alike, allowing for a deeper, more meaningful end-of-life experience. 

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my wife and son (I'll always be a family man first) as well as our 2 dogs. We especially enjoy being outdoors, hiking and exploring local parks. We've even run some 5K events as a family! Indoors, I enjoy games of all sorts, and relaxing with a good book or movie.
