Battling the constant messes from a pet with urinary incontinence can be exhausting and frustrating, despite knowing it’s not their fault. Pets can be born with ectopic ureters or bladder defects that lead to urinary incontinence, or they can develop a condition later in life that leads to urine leakage. Kidney disease, diabetes, Cushing’s disease, paralysis, and cognitive dysfunction also are common conditions senior pets can develop that can cause urinary incontinence. Although cleaning up urine puddles can take a toll on your bond with your pet, urinary incontinence can be easily managed, thereby restoring your bond with your furry friend. Try the following five ways to care for a pet with urinary incontinence.

## #1: Fit your pet for diapers to contain urinary accidents

Dog diapers can effectively help manage your pet’s cleanliness, but you will need to carefully monitor them for urine scalding and infection. Ensure your pet’s diaper is well-fitting, which may take some trial-and-error to find the best size. Once you outfit your pet, check them frequently for wetness. Some pets may need their diapers changed every few hours to ensure they remain clean and dry, and to help avoid urine scald and infection.

## #2: Keep your pet clean to avoid infections

Without frequent cleaning, your pet can easily develop skin and urinary tract infections, and the urine must be removed to prevent additional issues. Frequent bathing is necessary, but can dry out your pet’s skin, so opt for an oatmeal-based shampoo, or one formulated to soothe dry skin and treat infections. You can also use a waterless shampoo to spot clean urine-soaked areas, which works especially well for large-breed dogs and those who suffer from a paretic or plegic hind end. 

## #3: Use waterproof pads under your pet’s bedding

Limit messes in your home by placing waterproof pads under your pet’s bedding. Although the pads won’t keep your pet dry, they will prevent carpet stains. You may need to change your pet’s bedding daily, and you should always check for damp spots after your furry friend wakes up, and wash as needed. 

## #4: Take your pet for more frequent walks

Similar to a puppy, senior dogs with urinary incontinence need more frequent walks to minimize accidents in your home. Walk your dog when they first wake up, after they eat and drink, and every few hours throughout the day to limit urinary messes. 

## #5: Talk to your veterinarian about urinary incontinence treatment options

Many urinary incontinence cases are the result of a primary condition, which better management may provide relief for your pet. Conditions that can be medically or surgically managed to provide some measure of urinary incontinence relief include:

  * Diabetes — Pets with unregulated [diabetes ](/resource-center/common-diseases-in-cats/diabetes)drink and urinate frequently, so maintaining an ideal blood glucose level through insulin administration and diet is essential for minimizing urinary accidents. 
  * Kidney disease — While renal failure has no cure, you can help manage your pet’s [kidney disease](https://www.lapoflove.com/resource-center/common-diseases-in-cats/chronic-kidney-disease). Prescription diets, kidney health supplements, subcutaneous fluids, and additional therapies may help support your pet’s kidneys and decrease excessive thirst and urination.
  * Cushing’s disease — A body that produces too much cortisol, as with [Cushing’s disease](https://www.lapoflove.com/resource-center/common-diseases-in-dogs/hyperadrenocorticism), creates thirst and a need to urinate more frequently in affected pets. By successfully managing your pet’s Cushing’s disease with medication, you can help control urinary accidents. 
  * Cognitive dysfunction — Pets with [cognitive dysfunction](https://www.lapoflove.com/resource-center/common-diseases-in-dogs/cognitive-dysfunction) can lose much of their memory, including house-training and obedience skills. Although your pet’s decreased mental function cannot be fully restored, food puzzles, daily training, brain health supplements, prescription diets, and prescription medication can slow cognitive decline and support your pet’s mental function. 



Although caring for a pet with urinary incontinence can be time-consuming, there are many methods to help minimize accidents and keep your furry friend clean and comfortable.
