### 1:1 Individual Pet Loss Support Session

Grieving the loss of a pet is a very personal experience and the journey to healing is different for everyone. Our individual support sessions are for pet parents who desire personalized support on how to heal following the loss of their beloved pet. Individual call sessions are led by a highly trained, professional grief coach who will offer a compassionate ear and a caring safe space for the sharing of feelings and emotions surrounding the death of a loved pet.

Cost: $55.00 for a 50-minute session

*Individual support sessions are not meant to be a substitute for mental health support with a licensed mental health counselor. Our pet loss support offerings are available as a “companioning” model, providing support to the caller, not counseling. Callers will be provided with additional counseling service referrals if requested.

### Memorialize your pet

When your pet is no longer physically present, keeping their memory alive through a memento or keepsake can both honor them and help ease the grieving process. Whether it’s a painting of your pet or a necklace made from their pawprint, an object that you can hold in your hand creates a sense of everlasting connection.

Our Pet Memorial Keepsakes site was created for those who seek comfort in mementos after saying goodbye to a pet. The site offers a range of unique memorial items from carefully selected companies. We hope you find an item that perfectly symbolizes the forever bond between you and your beloved friend.

### MENTAL HEALTH DISCLAIMER:

_The loss of an animal companion can lead to challenging emotional responses that warrant professional mental health support which is beyond the scope and training of the Lap of Love Pet Loss Resource Line staff. While we are here to provide compassionate grief support, we are unable to appropriately evaluate human mental health concerns and do not provide mental health counseling. The services of the Pet Loss Resource Line are not intended to directly support or provide a substitute for definitive mental health care, especially in a crisis. We may be able to help you find pet loss support resources in your area, but we cannot provide referrals to specific mental health services._
