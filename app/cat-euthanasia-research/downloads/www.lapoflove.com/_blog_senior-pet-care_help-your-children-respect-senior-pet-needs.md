As your four-legged friend ages, they likely seek less interaction and attention from the family, which can confuse children. If they are accustomed to playing with an energetic, adult pet without osteoarthritis aches and pains, blindness, or deafness, learning to respect their senior pet’s changing needs can be difficult. Rather than responding to an accident, take steps to prevent potential altercations between your senior pet and your children. Here are three ways to help your household coexist peacefully when your pet becomes a senior.

## #1: Teach your children to learn to read your senior pet’s body language

While young children may have difficulty learning to read a pet’s body language, older children should be able to look for clues that a pet does not want to interact with. Signals your senior pet is uncomfortable or nervous include:

* Tense mouth and suddenly stopping to pant

* Freezing for a second or two before reacting

* Watching the child from the corner of their eye (i.e., whale eye)

* Pulling away when hugged or petted

* Lip licking

* Flattened ears

* Tucked tail

* Yawning

Cues your senior cat may show to demonstrate they are anxious or irritated include:

* Tail flicking or swishing, with the speed increasing as they become more agitated

* Flattened ears

* A hard stare with widened eyes 

* Flattened whiskers

It can be more challenging to detect when senior cats want to be left alone, so watch carefully for the slightest hint of unease when your child approaches.

If your child is too young to learn to correctly read your senior pet’s body language, always supervise their interactions so you can intervene if necessary.

## #2: Warn your child to never approach a sleeping senior pet

“Let sleeping pets lie” is an excellent rule to follow for any pet of any age, but especially for seniors whose vision and hearing have likely declined and who may not be alerted when people approach. A startled pet can easily bite, especially a sleeping senior pet suffering from cognitive dysfunction and failing to recognize your child immediately. Block access to your sleeping pet, or ensure your child understands that your furry friend must be left alone until they are awake.

## #3: Encourage your child to ask your senior pet for permission before interacting

Senior pets become tired more quickly and may want less interaction than when they were young. Always give your pet the opportunity to leave a game, grooming session, or petting, and never chase them if they leave. The pet-pet-pause method is a great way to teach your child to ask your senior pet for permission to pet. If your senior pet seems interested in interacting, let your child pet them for a few seconds, then pause. Pets who want more attention may nudge at your child’s arm or position their body to indicate the best scratching spot, while pets who want to be left alone will turn their head or walk away. Instruct your child to ask your senior pet for consent before petting or playing to help prevent miscommunication and missed warning signals.

Helping your beloved pet age gracefully and pass peacefully is a great gift and a reward for a lifetime of love. If your senior pet is battling a chronic condition or their quality of life is deteriorating, our [telehospice](/our-services/telehospice) service can help you assess your senior pet’s happiness and health, and determine whether [veterinary hospice](/our-services/veterinary-hospice) care can help. If medical management can no longer offer relief, [in-home euthanasia](/our-services/in-home-euthanasia) may be the most loving choice. A Lap of Love veterinarian in your area can help you through this difficult process.
