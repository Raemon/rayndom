#### About

Lap of Love offers veterinary end-of-life care services in East Bay and the surrounding areas. Under the care of our experienced, compassionate veterinarians, we exclusively provide in-home euthanasia and hospice. Veterinary hospice specifically addresses comfort care and pain management for pets. Our telehospice service allows you to speak with a veterinarian to discuss your pet's quality of life. Some of our doctors are experienced with certain exotic species as well.

We are here to answer your questions every day, from 4 am - 8 pm. Appointments are scheduled throughout the week, please call for availability.

Sometimes pets take a turn for the worse overnight or in a short amount of time, so we do our best to accommodate same day appointments with a few hours notice, but cannot guarantee that.

If this is a medical emergency, please contact your local veterinarian or one of the emergency clinics listed in the Local Resources section.

#### Service area

Our veterinarians proudly service East Bay. Due to the expansive area covered, there may be an extended travel fee of $30-$100 based on your location.
