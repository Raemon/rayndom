As the cold weather bears down this winter, your furry pal may not want to venture outdoors. Senior pets are susceptible to temperature changes and cannot regulate their body temperature as well as when they were younger. Follow these four tips to keep your senior pet warm and comfortable in the chilly winter season.

## #1: Monitor your senior pet for hypothermia signs when outdoors

When you’re enjoying a fresh snowfall with your furry pal, watch them closely to ensure they don’t develop hypothermia. If your pet’s body temperature drops to 99 degrees or lower, that may indicate hypothermia. Mild to moderate hypothermia signs in pets include:

* Shivering

* Muscle stiffness

* Lethargy

* Clumsy movements

* Difficulty walking

* Pale gums

* Skin that is cool to the touch

* Confusion

As hypothermia worsens, pets will:

* Stop shivering

* Collapse

* Have fixed, dilated pupils

* Develop slow and irregular heart and breathing rates

* Become comatose

Without appropriate warming measures, a hypothermic pet can die. At the first hint that your senior pet is getting cold (i.e., shivering, tense muscles), head to the warm indoors before frostbite and hypothermia can strike. 

## #2: Outfit your senior pet appropriately for the weather

Before heading outdoors, dress your senior pet for the weather. A warm, waterproof coat or vest will help trap body heat and prevent melting snow from soaking their fur. Booties or paw wax protect their paws from ice and chemicals, while nose balm provides a moisture barrier between a dry, cracked nose and the dry, frigid air. Ensure your pet’s winter gear fits well, especially the booties, which can cut off circulation and do more harm than good if they are too tight. 

## #3: Provide your senior pet with a warm place to sleep

If you have a fireplace or space heater in your home, your senior pet no doubt curls up close to its heat. However, these warming sources can be dangerous if they venture too close. Always protect your pet from burns by placing a screen around your fireplace and putting a space heater behind a baby gate or other barricade. Consider a self-warming, orthopedic bed for your pet’s maximum comfort during the chilly winter. Additionally, ensure your pet’s bed is placed away from doors and windows and free from drafts.

## #4: Soothe your arthritic senior pet’s aches and pains

Many senior pets suffer from osteoarthritis, and their stiff joints can feel more painful during the cold winter months. Soothe your pet’s aches and pains with the following tips:

* Invest in a quality joint supplement — Joint supplements come in strengths that cater to every joint disease stage. Depending on your pet’s condition, they may benefit from a more robust joint supplement that’s packed with anti-inflammatory and joint-repairing ingredients, like glucosamine, MSM, chondroitin, green-lipped mussel, boswellia serrata, omega-3 fatty acids, and antioxidants. Discuss your pet’s joint supplement options with your family veterinarian to find what will help them most.

* Maintain an ideal body weight — During the winter, your senior pet will likely burn more calories to stay warm, but you should still refrain from overfeeding. An ideal body condition will keep your senior pet in tip-top shape and help reduce stress on aching joints. Choose a high-quality diet rich in vitamins, antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids, and joint-supporting ingredients that will help improve mobility.

* Engage in daily exercise — Daily exercise will keep your senior pet’s joints lubricated, help maintain muscle mass, and provide mental stimulation. Regular, low-impact activities prevent cabin fever and keep your pet’s joints healthy.

Discuss a treatment plan with your veterinarian — Many senior pets reach a point where they need pharmaceutical and alternative therapies to manage their osteoarthritis pain. Discuss the best treatment plan with your family veterinarian to decide whether pain medication, acupuncture, chiropractic care, cold laser therapy, and other treatment modalities suit your pet.

Cold weather can be particularly harsh on senior pets, severely decreasing their quality of life.
