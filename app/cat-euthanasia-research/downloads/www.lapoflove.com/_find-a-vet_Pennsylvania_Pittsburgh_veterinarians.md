#### About Dr. Allison Kachmar

As a child, I don’t think I ever gave the same answer twice when asked what I wanted to be “when I grow up”. I was too busy investigating and exploring the world around me! It was this spirit of curiosity that took me to DePaul University in Chicago as an undergraduate student. While there, studying chemistry, I realized Veterinary Medicine would allow me to enjoy the wide array of interests I had cultivated as a child. 

After graduating from Texas A&M University as a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine, I moved to Pittsburgh and began working in small animal private practice. As my clinical experience increased, I developed special interests in feline medicine, animal behavior, and fear free handling. I also noticed that many of the most meaningful experiences I had were while counseling families during end of life care. It was only after saying goodbye to my own dog that I recognized the calling I felt to focus my energy entirely on this important work. 

Through Lap of Love, my aim is to decrease fear and stress for my patients and their families. It’s important to me that both pets and the people who love them find comfort in the care and skill I bring into their home. Providing the safe, supportive guidance a family needs to navigate one of life’s most difficult experiences – saying goodbye – is a privilege and honor. 

When I’m not playing outside with my husband and young son, you may find me knitting, cheering on our Pittsburgh Penguins, or reading. We share a house with our two feisty feline friends: Jane & Oscar.

#### About Dr. Michelle Martinek

I was born in Michigan, raised in Ohio, and now live in Pittsburgh, so I suppose you could call me a midwestern girl through and through. I was blessed to grow up with an amazing family of doctors, with some farmers and pilots thrown in too. My childhood was spent catching frogs, snakes, and salamanders by the creek, bringing home box turtles from the corn fields, riding horses, and swimming in Lake Cumberland. My two dearest friends were my cats, and the three of us were inseparable. 

I developed a love for medicine and animals at a young age, and as I grew, my sense of adventure sent my cats and I all the way to the University of Miami, where I received my bachelor’s degree in marine science and biology. After graduation, I returned home to attend the Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine, where I earned my veterinary degree. 

I discovered a passion for exotic animal medicine and pursued many advanced training opportunities to serve all our wonderful and weird pet species. Variety has always been the spice of life for me! As much as I loved my work and learning new, complex drug therapies, treatment modalities, and surgical techniques, I realized my ultimate purpose in life is simply to ease the suffering of animals. 

Sometimes, easing an animal’s suffering doesn’t mean more treatments, trips to the vet, or pills, but rather finding comfort and peace at home. Through my role at Lap of Love, I hope to support pet owners, help them recognize suffering, and understand that aging and death is not something to fear. A dignified, pain-free passing is one of the greatest gifts we can give our animal companions, and I consider it a complete honor to witness the love between families and pets in their final moments at home. 

When I’m not working, I find my own peace through gardening, reading, ballroom dancing, and flying. I hope to follow in the family footsteps and earn my private pilot’s license soon. Then, life’s adventures can continue ever onward! 

#### About Dr. Jackie Fera

I was born and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The three rivers, black and gold, and pierogies are forever a part of me. As a child, I was fascinated by animals and dedicated myself to learning as much about them as I could. I spent much of my time begging my parents for various pets and even tried to secretly raise baby birds and snakes in the basement. Surprisingly, my earliest childhood career aspirations did not include becoming a veterinarian and ranged from computer science to Egyptology. That changed in high school when our family veterinarian invited me to shadow her. The experience sparked my interest and helped me realize that a career in veterinary medicine would allow me to help both animals and people. 

I earned my bachelor’s degree in biochemistry at Washington & Jefferson College in Pennsylvania and completed veterinary school at the University of Pennsylvania. 

I have always had a special interest in the bond between humans and animals, and my time working as a general practitioner and a federal public health veterinarian has allowed me to witness and support that connection in a variety of ways. In addition to end-of-life care, my veterinary interests include reproduction and medical genetics, radiology, behavior, and public health. 

My passion for end-of-life care began when my family dog, Heidi, passed away suddenly at home while I was attending veterinary school. While we were shocked and saddened to lose her after so many years, we found comfort in knowing that she was home with her family. Heidi’s passing impressed upon me how peaceful and special it can be for a pet to spend their final moments at home with their loved ones. Saying goodbye to a pet is one of the hardest decisions a family must make, and I am honored to be able to witness the love between pets and their families while supporting them through the end-of-life process. 

When I’m not working, I enjoy playing the piano and violin, reading, horseback riding, video games, archery, and cheering on the Steelers and my favorite sumo wrestlers. I also have a longtime interest in training, grooming, and showing dogs.
