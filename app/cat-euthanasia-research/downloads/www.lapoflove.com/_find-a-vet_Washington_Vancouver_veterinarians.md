#### About Dr. Dani Rockstad

I grew up in Kansas City, Missouri, also known as the City of Fountains since it’s said to have more fountains than Rome! My childhood love of animals, along with an affinity for math and science, led me to pursue a career in veterinary medicine.

I attended the University of Missouri Columbia—Go Tigers!—where I completed my undergraduate studies and veterinary school. After receiving my veterinary degree, I practiced emergency medicine for twelve years before transitioning to general practice, and then becoming the practice’s medical director. I love being a veterinarian because I get to help animals and people—caring is one of my superpowers! I enjoy forming relationships with families while practicing emergency medicine. 

I have lost many pets over the years, and my last three pets were able to pass at home. The goodbye process is much more personal, private, calm, and peaceful when done at home, especially for senior and geriatric pets. I really enjoy providing quality end-of-life care because it is the most important time of that pet's life. Being there for a grieving family gives me a sense of making a difference in this world, and reminds me that what I do matters. Grief is a common language that allows us to connect deeply with others. 

I currently live in Vancouver, Washington with my husband, two children, our twin kitties, Kiera and Watney, and our feisty chinchilla, Chewbacca Flash. I have many interests outside of work and acquire new ones almost weekly. I enjoy camping in our pop-up trailer, traveling, vegetable gardening, reading, and playing video games—no thanks to my kids for enabling this addiction. More recent pursuits include astronomy, playing the ukulele, birdwatching, photography, and volunteering at the local science museum.

#### About Dr. Jamie Romig

Before I could spell the word, I dreamt of becoming a veterinarian. My parents love to tell me—and anyone who will listen—that I wanted to be a veterinarian from an early age. Our family pets allowed me to experience the highs and lows of loving animals, from their arrival into our home to their last moments on earth. With every cherished pet we loved and lost, my surety about becoming a veterinarian deepened.

I grew up in a suburb outside of East Lansing, Michigan, which allowed me to enjoy Michigan State University's campus and countless local outdoor experiences. Naturally, I attended MSU for my undergraduate and veterinary school education. It’s been my second home, from the time I could walk until I moved away for my first veterinary job.

As a general practice veterinarian, I enjoyed providing preventive care to support long-term pet health. But most of all, I found fulfillment in easing a pet’s pain, providing palliative care for older pets, and supporting pets and pet parents with end-of-life care. 

In both my personal and professional life, I’ve faced pet loss in many forms—from saying a planned goodbye at the veterinary hospital to the heartbreaking, sudden loss of a young puppy. These experiences have led me to believe that euthanasia is the greatest act of love I can provide, as a pet parent and a veterinarian. Providing this kindness in the privacy and familiarity of the pet’s home through Lap of Love comforts not only the pet but their family as well.

When I’m not tending to pets, you’ll find me by the fire, curled up with my cats and a good book—or at least daydreaming about it. I also enjoy video games and crocheting small plush animals.
