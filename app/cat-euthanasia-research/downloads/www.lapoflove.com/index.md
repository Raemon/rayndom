#### Dr. Vanessa

In-Home Pet Euthanasia in South Central PA: Lancaster, Dauphin, Lebanon & York Counties

I grew up in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania. My father was a veterinarian and my mother was an animal-loving elementary school counselor, so we always had several pets. However, it wasn't until college, when I started volunteering at a local shelter and wildlife rehabilitation center, and I adopted the cat of my life, Haggis, that I seriously considered a career in veterinary medicine. 

I earned my bachelor’s degree from the University of Pittsburgh with a double major in Japanese and anthropology in 2006. I completed all my prerequisite coursework for veterinary school as a post-baccalaureate at Pitt. I attended veterinary school at Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine in St. Kitts and completed my clinical year at the University of Missouri. I was awarded my Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine with honors in May 2014. 

I've worked in small animal general practice in State College and Williamsport, Pennsylvania, and mobile wellness services throughout the state. I like being a vet because our animal family members give us so much, and they deserve as good a life (and death) as we can give them in return. 

The bond between people and their pets is central to everything I do as a veterinarian. I want to always honor that relationship and help owners focus on the wonderful life their pet had, rather than the pet's death. I feel privileged to glimpse the depth of love and affection between people and their pets at such a profound time in their lives, and being there for people in those moments is so fulfilling. 

I've always viewed euthanasia as one of the greatest honors of our profession. We can bring beloved pets peace at the end of their lives, and hold space for the heartfelt grief of their human family. In that sense, perhaps I came pre-molded for this type of work. 

My other interests include reading, live music, and travel. My husband is my best friend, and we have a son who keeps us busy. We also have two cats (Wikket and Fishstick), a hamster (Freeze), a yellow lab (Bogey), and tropical fish.

Dr. Rachel was so compassionate and professional. She was kind and helped us through every step. We are so very grateful that she was available on short notice and that Lap of Love is in our community.

#### Lisa

I wish that I had never had to use this service but thank goodness for Lap of Love and Dr. Jodi. July 8, 2024 was a very emotional day that was made bearable by Dr. Jodi. She was incredibly kind and patient and her calm demeanor was exactly what I needed. More than that, she was what Lucy needed. I cannot say enough good things about every person that I spoke to at Lap of Love and on this grief filled day, Dr. Jodi was truly our Angel. I love you, my sweet Lucy!

We could not have asked for a more peaceful experience with Dr. Wilbourne. We're so glad to have made the choice to use Lap of Love.

#### Sara

Dr Moe was incredibly considerate, kind, informative, and understanding. She understood the bond I had with my boy and did everything she could to soften the blow of losing him. I am so thankful for her service and she has made healing an easier, more cathartic process.

#### Bob & July

Dr. Puls was so wonderful. We were a wreck when she came to our house but she was able to guide us in a way that allowed us to make a thoroughly informed decision. Her compassion and loving demeanor made an awful day easier and we will always be grateful to her. 

#### Gizelle

Pembroke Pines, Florida

Dr. Diana, you heart felt kindness and compassion helped us through this difficult time in a way we could never imagine. Having helped several of our previous dogs cross to the rainbow bridge at the vet's office, we knew what to expect, and didn't want to do it with her. Having the option to help her at home instead, surrounded by all those who loved her, even her goofy brothers Charlie and Snoopy, was so much peaceful and easier. We appreciate so much the time you took with us and our little Annie, your patience, your soothing manners, and for listening to our stories. We thank you from the bottom of our hearts. We will never forget you. xoxo

When the time came to decide what was best for my 18-year-old Yorkie, Ozzy, I knew it had to be in-home. He had protected his home for 18 years, he would leave my world at his home and we would bury him at his home. He was a fearless protector, all 6 pounds of him and saying goodbye was so difficult. I called Lap of Love and they set me up an appointment within 24 hours of my request. Everyone I spoke to was kind and compassionate as one would hope someone in this kind of profession would be. Dr. Tina came over, sat with us and Ozzy and explained the procedure. She loved on Ozzy, made sure my family and Ozzy were absolutely comfortable. She was so compassionate and kind to our family. She made this process as peaceful as possible for my precious pup and my family. I am so thankful and grateful for this service offered. I couldn't imagine another way to say goodbye to my Ozzy. Thank you, everyone.

Rocky was my first dog. I got him in college and we grew up together. He had been diabetic for many years, and I dreaded this day as anyone does, but especially after moving to a city with no close friends or family to help support me through it. Everyone at Lap of Love was great every step of the way. I had to make the decision without much advance warning due to a drastic decline in his health, and they were able to accommodate a same-day appointment while also giving me a few hours to say goodbye first. I am a very private person with my emotions, so I cannot overstate how much easier it was for me personally to be able to say goodbye in my own home, and with my other dog present as well. Dr. Rhoades was amazing, and I immediately felt comfortable with her. For what is always the worst day for any pet owner, she made it as easy as possible under the circumstances. I will be forever grateful for their caring demeanor and professionalism, and for being able to say goodbye at home, on our own terms. I cannot recommend them enough.
