Receiving a cancer diagnosis for your pet is scary, especially when you think about their eventual decline. However, pets with cancer can enjoy a good quality of life despite their diagnosis, and can still enjoy daily activities. By catering to your pet’s needs based on the effects of their cancer, you can keep them comfortable for as long as possible.

## How to support your pet’s appetite 

Many pets with cancer feel unwell, and lose their appetite, turning up their nose at their normal kibble, and sometimes their water. Depending on your pet’s cancer and their management and treatment, your pet may benefit from a prescription diet designed to support specific organ health. Otherwise, you can entice your pet to eat and drink proper amounts in many ways, including the following:

* Mix canned food into dry food — Some pets enjoy the extra moisture and flavor offered by canned food, so mix some into your pet’s dry food, or switch solely to canned. By adding canned food, or plain water, to your pet’s dry food, you can boost their water intake. Additionally, prescription diets, such as Hill’s a/d and Purina CN, are formulated to be energy- and nutrient-rich, making them ideal supplements for pets with poor health.

* Warm up canned food before serving — Heating up the food to body temperature—around 100 degrees—can perk up a pet’s appetite. Mix the canned food well after heating to avoid hot spots. 

* Ensure food is fresh — Feed several small meals per day, rather than doling out a large portion of canned food. Crusty, stale canned food is not appetizing, and small, fresh amounts may entice your pet.

* Make eating and drinking easy — Keep your pet’s food and water dishes in the room where they spend most of their time, elevated if needed. Many senior pets suffer from arthritis in their elbows and neck, and bending down to reach their bowl can be uncomfortable.

* Avoid associating medication with food — While some medications need to be given with food, avoid tossing a potentially bitter- or foul-tasting pill in with your pet’s regular food. Instead, reserve a special treat, such as a hot dog, tuna, or cheese, for administering medication. Wait half an hour to an hour after your pet has eaten to give medication that must be given with food. 

* Administer an appetite stimulant — Some pets may refuse to eat enough calories to remain strong, so an appetite stimulant can help boost their hunger. 

* Purchase a drinking fountain — Fresh, running water can be a huge draw for pets, and will likely encourage them to drink more than from a plain water dish.

Ensuring your pet eats and drinks enough to fulfill their nutritional requirements is essential for a good quality of life. Ask your primary care veterinarian for help if your pet’s appetite or thirst has diminished. 

## How to manage your pet’s pain and mobility

Pets with cancer can suffer from pain caused by their condition or natural aging effects and associated osteoarthritis. And, pets in pain often do not eat or drink well, which can create a downward spiral of poor quality of life. Consider the following to help manage your pet’s pain and improve their mobility:

* Administer appropriate pain medications — Use only veterinarian-prescribed pain medications to help alleviate your pet’s discomfort. Inform your veterinarian if your pet’s pain level has changed because numerous medications are formulated to provide pain relief. They work on different body pathways, offering varied results that depend on your pet’s case.

* Investigate alternative pain management therapies — Acupuncture, chiropractic care, hydrotherapy, laser therapy, and other alternative therapies are excellent options to include in your pet’s pain management protocol. These therapies have few, if any, side effects, and can typically be used safely in conjunction with medications, chemotherapy, and radiation.

* Modify your home to improve your pet’s comfort — Rather than making your pet scale the stairs to their sleeping or eating areas, place all their resources on the main floor, and build ramps so they can go outside. Cushion your pet’s resting place with a firm, orthopedic-style bed rather than a soft one that sinks down to the floor. 

* Invest in mobility aids — Slick floors can make walking more difficult for a painful pet, so apply [toe grips](https://toegrips.com/) or [paw-pad adhesives](https://pawfriction.com/) to help them gain traction. Carpet runners placed on hardwood or tile floors will also help your pet maintain their balance.

Pets who have been diagnosed with cancer can still maintain a good quality of life for some time, but each pet is different.
