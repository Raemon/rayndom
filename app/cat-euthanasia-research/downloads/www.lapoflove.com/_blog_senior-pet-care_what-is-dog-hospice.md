As dogs enter the final stage of life, pet owners often face a challenging and emotional experience. Veterinary hospice care is designed to support the pet and its family by focusing on comfort, quality of life, and preparing for a peaceful passing.

Knowing what to expect and understanding the available care options can make this period more manageable. With the guidance of a veterinarian experienced in hospice care, pet owners can make informed decisions that ease their dog’s final days and ensure compassionate end-of-life support.
