#### About Dr. Tiffany Matheson

Growing up in rural Oklahoma I had many pets, some of which included dogs, cats, fish, rabbits, and even pigs. I spent nearly all my time with them or reading about them and when I was only five years old I told my parents that I wanted to be a veterinarian.

For my 16th birthday I got a Dalmatian puppy named Molly. Molly was my baby, and she was with me through high school, undergraduate college, and vet school. During my final year of vet school though, Molly became ill with chronic liver disease and 2 days after graduation I had to make the decision to let her go. This was my first time having to make that decision and while it was very difficult I was thankful that I was able to give Molly the gift of ending her pain.

Throughout the past 9 years while working as a Veterinarian, I have helped many people say goodbye to their babies and I feel privileged to have been able to give them a peaceful and loving last memory.

#### About Dr. Kimberly Moen

I grew up in California and Arizona. Along the way, I connected with many creatures, large and small, and they have been a core part of my life. Since I was old enough to walk, I played by butting heads with my goat Willie, rode horses with joy, and sneaked around the forest to catch a glimpse of wild deer. I even found a "secret" place for a new kitten amongst my stuffed animals so I could keep her inside the house. As a child, most of my conversations revolved around how my friends’ pets were doing. 

I formed a strong bond with my childhood dog, Katie Mae. She was a Labrador/Husky mix who sang beautifully with the coyotes at night and befriended my guinea pig, Skittles, who shared veggies with her. We took care of each other for ten amazing years. When, Katie suffered from a systemic infection beyond treatment, it crushed me. I have endured the loss of many beloved companions over the course of my life, and deeply understand the strong the connection between an animal and a human. 

It was inevitable that I would take the Veterinarian's oath to help animals, to prevent and relieve their suffering. So, I proudly graduated from Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine after doing my clinical rotations at the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine. I then went on to gain experience through general practice. Now, it is my desire to support and connect with people and their beloved animals alike. Through providing in-home hospice and peaceful transitions, I achieve this goal. For me, it is a beautiful thing to offer comfort and guidance to people during their most challenging and selfless gift to their furry family members. 

#### About Dr. Sheena Maynard

I grew up in Upstate New York in the small farming town of Kendall, and I’ve had a passion for helping animals since I was a child. I once found an abandoned baby rabbit in the bushes, and I bottle-fed it until it was released back into the wild. At my sixteenth birthday party, I announced to my friends and family that I would become a veterinarian someday, and I am so glad I’ve been able to keep my word. 

After graduating high school I moved to Melbourne, Florida to pursue a degree in veterinary technology at Brevard Community College (now Eastern Florida State College) and became a certified veterinary technician. I worked in general practice as a small animal technician for about six years while also pursuing my bachelor’s degree in veterinary hospital management from St. Petersburg College. 

It was while working at a specialty cancer clinic, administering chemotherapy to cats and dogs that I decided to pursue veterinary school. I attended the University of Florida in Gainesville and graduated with my veterinary degree. 

People describe me as caring, empathetic, and kind, and I’ve always had a soft spot in my heart for geriatric animals and people. I enjoy helping care for my neighbor’s elderly “grandma” pets and I am always ready to lend a listening ear to anyone who needs my time. 

I know how difficult it is to say goodbye to a pet. I lost my 14-year-old shih-tzu, Rusty, when he became suddenly ill during my third year of veterinary school. The experience taught me a lot and was one of the reasons I wanted to work for Lap of Love. I look forward to helping families and their pets and providing them with a peaceful goodbye. 

Outside of work, I enjoy paddle boarding, camping, hiking, bike riding, and spending time with my rescued rabbit, Yeti. I also have my student pilot’s license, and enjoy skydiving, scuba diving, and running marathons with my friends. I look forward to this new chapter of life as part of the Lap of Love family! 

#### About Dr. Juliana Cafiero

I spent my young childhood in Ft. Lauderdale Florida, but moved to Melbourne in middle school and returned to Brevard County after college and veterinary school to be close to family. I have wanted to be a vet for as long as I can remember. I was always finding lost pets so I could help reunite them with their families, and in college, I assisted the pre-vet society trap and release a majority of the feral cat population in Tampa.

I received my bachelor's degree in biology from the University of South Florida in Tampa and my veterinary degree from Ross University, finishing my clinical year at the University of Florida in Gainesville. I received my acupuncture training and certification at the Chi Institute, and am working toward spinal manipulation certification. 

I have had the fortunate opportunity to hold a variety of small animal practice jobs. I love holistic care and pain management and hope to expand to rehabilitation therapy one day (acupuncture, chiropractic care). My passion lies in helping alleviate pain for pets—helping a pet feel better with treatments beyond a prescription pain pill is rewarding. I love being a veterinarian because I love making a difference for pets and families, no matter how small. 

I have had many pets in my lifetime. Losing a pet never gets easy, but it can be a very different experience from one pet to another. The most heartbreaking and difficult was suddenly losing my favorite cat, Squirrel, to heart disease. I could not be with her when she passed, and losing out on that opportunity has helped me guide other pet parents in making difficult end-of-life decisions. I like to view end-of-life care as my final gift to families and pets. If I can help a family or a pet through that difficult time, then I've made a small difference in the world for them.

When I’m not working, I love paddleboarding with my dog Remi and my significant other, and biking around town. We also love live music, karaoke, fishing, and playing board games with friends and family. 

#### About Dr. Sabrina Daniels

I am originally from Cowlesville, New York, a tiny rural town where cattle outnumber people. As a child, I spent most of my time by the nearby creek or listening to birds in the woods. I was often accompanied by my first dog, Princess, a beautiful rough collie. Princess was a loyal companion and a great listener, always eager to hear me read books aloud and sing her songs.

As Princess aged, she suffered from arthritis and cognitive decline. Although we said our goodbyes and she was lovingly escorted across the rainbow bridge, I knew I would never forget my first friend. I promised to help pets like her, and families like mine, by supporting them through end-of-life care.

My journey to becoming a veterinarian began at Medaille College, where I studied veterinary technology. I went on to work as a licensed veterinary technician (LVT) for nine years in a busy eight-doctor general practice. During that time, I attended the University of Buffalo for my undergraduate and master’s degrees in biological sciences. This was followed by veterinary school at Ross University. I completed my clinical training and primary care internship at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 

While end-of-life care and supporting the human-animal bond are my primary interests, I enjoy many aspects of veterinary medicine, including dentistry, cardiology, oncology, and working with pocket pets and reptiles.

As a Lap of Love veterinarian, I am honored to provide care that eases discomfort for pets and their families while also witnessing such a beautiful expression of love. I find the human-animal bond to be one of life’s deepest and most fulfilling experiences. Our pets give us purpose, belonging, and love without the need for words. I believe this bond continues despite the loss of their physical presence, and that while their passing brings us pain and sadness, it gives them freedom and peace.

When I’m not caring for pets and their families, you’ll find me outdoors. I love to kayak, hike, and camp. I also enjoy traveling to new places, playing video games, and swimming.

#### About Dr. Jaclyn Colton

My hometown is Rockledge, Florida, which was a wonderful place to grow up. I could watch shuttles and rockets go up while I was on the playground, and I enjoyed being close to the beach and Orlando’s theme parks.

I have always had a passion for animals, science, and medicine, and my first job was as a kennel technician at a local veterinary clinic. This experience helped me gain the skills to work as a veterinary assistant, and I eventually became a veterinary technician. 

I am a Gator alum and received my undergraduate degree in wildlife ecology and conservation and my Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) degree from the University of Florida.

In my 15 years in the veterinary field, I have worked in general practice and wildlife medicine at the Brevard Zoo, and I also have an extensive background in ecology and wildlife research focusing on the population genetic health of endangered species. 

I have lost two special dogs in my life. The experiences with Bogey and Sugar taught me how to have compassion for owners struggling with the decision to euthanize. I also learned how important it is to ensure a patient’s quality of life if an owner isn’t ready to say goodbye.

I am passionate about hospice and end-of-life care. My goal is to offer compassion and understanding as I help conclude a patient’s suffering or struggles with an illness, and owners are typically extremely grateful. I’m honored to help navigate these difficult situations.

In my spare time, I enjoy going on adventures with my two dogs, Meeka and Leeloo. Meeka and I also have fun competing in agility trials. Reading and embroidery are other hobbies I find relaxing and enriching. 

#### About Dr. Kate Heppner

I was born and raised in Tampa, Florida, a city I’m proud to call home. I grew up in an agricultural environment, riding horses and showing horses and cows. We had a menagerie of pets, including potbellied pigs, goats, chickens, dogs, cats, and fish. Veterinary medicine was a natural career path for me, and I never considered anything else. 

I completed my undergraduate studies at Clemson University and the University of Florida, and then attended veterinary school at Ross University. After graduating, I completed a rotating small animal internship at North Carolina State University and began working in emergency medicine. I have always been passionate about pain management, which led me to pursue a certification in acupuncture. By controlling pain, I’m able to help patients live their best lives.

I've lost many beloved pets over the years, including my childhood horse of 22 years and several soul dogs. It was very important to me that they remained comfortable in their final stages of life and that the family members and household pets they were bonded to could be present to comfort them during their passing.

Pets and animals have an enormously positive impact on our quality of life. We view them as family members, and they deserve to be treated and cared for as such. By providing this care through Lap of Love, I know that I’m making a positive and meaningful impact on each pet and their human families.

Outside of veterinary medicine, I enjoy horseback riding and working out. I am a competitive CrossFit athlete and partake in competitions several times a year. I also enjoy all water activities, including scuba diving, boating, fishing, and relaxing on the beach.
