The aging process tends to sneak up on us, especially when our beloved pets are involved. One day, they’re zooming around the house, and the next, they’re curling up and resting their greying muzzle on a cozy blanket. A pet’s senior years can be filled with joy, but this is also when health problems are likely to develop.

How you address their health issues can impact your senior pet’s longevity and well-being. Knowing what to look for, you can recognize problems before symptoms advance and when treatment is more effective. Let’s look at the top five senior pet health issues so you can spot them early and you and your veterinarian can develop a successful treatment plan.

## 1\. Heart disease in senior pets

[Heart disease](/resource-center/common-diseases-in-dogs/heart-disease) commonly affects middle-aged and older pets, but the condition differs from typical human heart disease. Dogs and cats don’t commonly develop arterial plaques like people. Heart valve disease is the most common heart condition in older dogs, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which causes thickened heart muscle, is the most common heart condition in older cats. Both diseases can eventually lead to congestive heart failure. Severity depends on the individual—in some pets, heart disease progresses slowly and causes only mild effects, while others may quickly develop life-threatening diseases. 

Heart disease becomes apparent only when advanced. You may notice your pet tiring easily, [fainting](/blog/senior-pet-health-and-safety/hospice-collapsing-episodes), or coughing in advanced cases, but usually, the first sign is a heart murmur that your veterinarian can detect during a routine exam. Medications can help improve heart function and may slow progression or prevent complications. 

## 2\. Kidney disease in senior pets

[Kidney disease](/resource-center/common-diseases-in-dogs/chronic-kidney-disease) is prevalent in older pets, especially cats. Pets with inadequate kidney function become dehydrated, toxins build up in their blood, body function declines rapidly, and they feel generally unwell. Some pets with kidney disease develop high blood pressure, which can lead to retinal damage, blindness, and further kidney deterioration. Symptoms include increased thirst and urination, poor appetite, vomiting, weight loss, and bad breath. 

Early detection is key to treating kidney disease. Unfortunately, symptoms don’t become apparent until the disease is advanced, making routine wellness visits and disease screening critical in older pets. When the disease is diagnosed in late stages, treatments focus on controlling clinical signs but can’t stop the progression or cure the disease. 

## 3\. Dental disease in senior pets

[Dental diseas](/blog/senior-pet-care/4-reasons-for-senior-pet-dental-care)e usually begins by age three and, without intervention, worsens throughout a pet’s life. Dental disease involves plaque and tartar buildup that traps bacteria along the gum line, leading to progressive inflammation and infection that can spread to vital organs. Symptoms include drooling, bad breath, difficulty chewing or playing with toys, bleeding gums, loose or missing teeth, and brown or yellow buildup.

Prevention is critical to preserve your pet’s dental health and quality of life. Daily toothbrushing is ideal, but dental chews, dental diets, water additives, and other products can help. Pets with existing dental disease require a professional veterinary dental cleaning to remove plaque and bacteria.

## 4\. Obesity in senior pets

Slowed metabolism and reduced activity are a recipe for obesity, a significant concern for senior pet health. Some evidence suggests that pet obesity is linked to inflammation, which increases the risk of many other diseases, such as diabetes and cancer. Obese, arthritic senior pets often suffer from poor mobility.

Consult your veterinarian to determine the right food for your pet’s breed, age, and goal weight, and then stick to the diet. Exercise can be strenuous for aging pets, so start with a short, slow walk each day and work up to an extra few minutes at a time. Low-impact exercise can help improve comfort and provide bonding moments each day.

## 5\. Cancer in senior pets

Statistically speaking, [cancer](/blog/common-pet-diseases-and-symptoms/what-does-it-mean-to-stage-my-pets-cancer) is one of the most common causes of pet death. Cancer can develop anywhere in the body, including the skin or internal organs. Tumors can be non-cancerous (i.e., benign) or cancerous (i.e., malignant) with greatly varied symptoms, depending on the tumor’s location. [Lumps and bumps](/blog/senior-pet-care/lumps-and-bumps-on-senior-pet), unexplained weight loss, and behavior changes are common signs of cancer. 

No one is sure how to prevent cancer, but you can ensure early detection with regular veterinary visits and by closely monitoring your senior pet’s health for changes. Treatment options for some cancers include surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation. A veterinary oncologist can help you choose the best choice for you and your pet.

You can’t stop your pet from growing older, but you can focus on prevention for their overall health and well-being. A balanced diet, regular exercise, and mental stimulation throughout a pet’s life can pave the way for a healthy future.
