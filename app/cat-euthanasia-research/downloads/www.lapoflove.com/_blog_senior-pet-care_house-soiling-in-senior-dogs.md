If your senior dog has started house soiling, you may be upset and frustrated. You thought that problem was addressed long ago when you house trained them as a puppy. As dogs age, they may revert to house soiling for several reasons. The first step should be a veterinary evaluation because this behavior in senior dogs is typically a medical issue.

## Your senior dog may have forgotten they were supposed to go outside.

[Cognitive dysfunction syndrome](/resource-center/common-diseases-in-dogs/cognitive-dysfunction) (CDS) is a disease affecting geriatric dogs characterized by an age-related decline in cognitive abilities, such as perception, awareness, learning, and memory. CDS incidence is high, affecting about 28 percent of 11- to 12-year-old dogs and 68 percent of 15- to 16-year-old dogs. CDS typically has three stages:

* Stage 1 (mild) — Senior dogs have changes in their sleep patterns and slight changes in social interactions.

* Stage 2 (moderate) — Senior dogs exhibit hyperactivity at night, start to forget their house training and require special care.

* Stage 3 (severe) — Senior dogs have dramatic behavior problems, including aimless wandering, barking through the night, unresponsiveness to family, and significant house soiling.

Certain management practices to provide environmental enrichment for your senior pet, may help slow CDS progression. You can also talk to your veterinarian about dietary modifications and medications that may help your senior dog’s condition. No specific treatment exists for house soiling caused by CDS.

## Your senior dog may not be able to wait until they get outside.

Several medical conditions in your senior dog can cause incontinence, which is the inability to control their bladder or bowels fully, and results in inappropriate soiling that is not your dog’s fault. Conditions including urinary tract infections, [kidney disease](/resource-center/common-diseases-in-dogs/chronic-kidney-disease), spinal problems, gastrointestinal disorders, and loss of hormones caused by spaying or neutering can cause incontinence. Common signs in your incontinent senior dog include:

* Leaking urine while sleeping

* Having a bowel movement while sleeping

* Dribbling urine while standing or walking

* Dropping feces while standing or walking

* Wet spots on their bedding

* A urine or feces smell on your dog

Some medications and supplements are available to help treat certain incontinence problems, but not all cases can be resolved.

## Your senior dog may be experiencing pain that causes them not to go outside.

Arthritis is a common condition affecting senior dogs that can cause significant pain and decreased mobility. If your senior dog is experiencing arthritis pain, they may not be able or willing to go outside to do their business. They also may not be able to posture correctly to urinate or defecate, resulting in their coat becoming soiled. Medications are available to help mitigate your senior dog’s arthritis pain.

## What can you do if your senior dog is house soiling?

If your senior dog is house soiling because of a condition that cannot be treated, you can take several steps to help keep your home clean.

* Revert to puppy training — Increase the frequency you take your senior dog on walks. Take them out after eating, drinking, and after they have been asleep.

* Waterproof their environment — Put waterproof covers on your senior dog’s bed, and any other resting areas.

* Use puppy pads — Place them in several areas of the house where your senior dog can access them easily.

* Use doggy diapers — Doggy diapers can help prevent accidents, but ensure you change them frequently, to avoid skin irritation and infections.

* Bathe frequently — Bathe your senior dog frequently to prevent odor, irritation, and infection. 

* Clean appropriately — If your senior pet has an accident, clean the area well using an enzymatic cleaner, to prevent them from being attracted to the area.

Managing a pet who is house soiling can be frustrating, and patience is important while determining the cause of the behavior. If a medical issue is causing the problem, your senior dog is not at fault, and they may be anxious about being punished if they cannot wait to go outside. Remember—your senior dog has been a loyal friend for a long time, and they deserve to be treated with dignity as old age affects their [quality of life](/quality-of-life-assessment).
