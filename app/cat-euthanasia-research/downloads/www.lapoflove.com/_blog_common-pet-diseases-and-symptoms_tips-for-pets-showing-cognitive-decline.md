Like humans, pets experience[cognitive ](/resource-center/common-diseases-in-dogs/cognitive-dysfunction)changes that occur naturally as they age. Similar to [dementia](/resource-center/symptom-management/dementia) or Alzheimer’s, it’s common to see shifts in behavior and demeanor, including agitation, restlessness, disorientation, confusion, or vocalizing. Some symptoms may be more prevalent at certain times of the day than others, prompting a shift in the household routine. Navigating these cognitive changes can be challenging for pet parents and cause concern that their pet is experiencing emotional distress or physical discomfort. Thankfully, some tools and resources may alleviate concerning behaviors and symptoms and empower pet parents to support their loved ones better.

## Provide environmental support

* Add night lights to reduce shadows later in the day that may contribute to “sundowning” and evening anxiety.

* Offer sound enhancements such as white noise machines and calming music to create a tranquil environment that encourages relaxation and sleep. Peaceful sounds may also reduce anxiety if your pet wakes up at night. 

* Adaptil (for dogs) and Feliway (for cats) emit pheromones into the environment via spray, a plug-in adapter, or a wearable collar to ease anxiety and stress.

* Place baby gates on stairs to protect your pet from falling if they wander at night, which is a standard cognitive behavior change. 

## Offer enrichment activities

Toys like Kongs®, Toppls®, snuffle mats, and treat puzzles provide mental stimulation, sharpen cognitive skills, and help relieve boredom and anxiety during idle time.

Offer plenty of opportunities for fresh air and time outside. Provide dogs with short, frequent walks throughout the day. If mobility is an issue, consider a stroller or a cart rather than heading out on foot. Set up a playpen outdoors if the weather is appropriate to provide a safe area where your pet can enjoy fresh air; this is a good option for dogs with mobility challenges and indoor cats with a curiosity for the great outdoors.

## Take note of your pet’s “witching hour”

“Witching hour” is when your pet’s cognitive symptoms are most prevalent. Adjusting your pet’s medication regime or activity schedule to get ahead of this time may help decrease the intensity of their symptoms. 

## Take it up a notch

Many over-the-counter supplements are specially formulated to alleviate symptoms associated with cognitive aging in pets. Ask your veterinary care team if these may be appropriate for your pet:

* Senilife

* Zylkene

* Zentrol

* Composure

Melatonin can also be incorporated to promote restful sleep; discuss with your veterinary care provider if this would be appropriate, and if so, what dosage would be recommended.

## Consider more extensive support 

Ask your veterinary care team if transitioning to a cognitive support, prescription formula diet may benefit your pet. 

* Hill’s b/d

* Purina Neuro Care

Ask your veterinary care team if they can recommend any prescription medications (such as selegiline) to reduce your pet's cognitive dysfunction. Remember that many of these medications can take time to reach full effectiveness.
