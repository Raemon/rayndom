#### About Dr. Nikki Lynch

From as early as I can remember, my life has revolved around animals, and I wouldn’t have it any other way! They have been my passion and purpose, and I, their healer, advocate, and friend. As a little girl growing up in Long Island, NY I could be found rescuing orphaned wildlife, riding horses, or playing with my family’s menagerie of cats, dogs, hamsters, rabbits, turtles, lizards, and frogs. I loved anything pertaining to science and the natural world, and often spent entire summer days collecting and studying specimens of leaves, bugs, seashells, rocks, and flowers, and jotting down notes about them in my little nature journal. I think I speak for all of my colleagues when I say that you don’t just choose a career in veterinary medicine; it chooses you. 

In my years of practice as a general practitioner, I have found that one of the most important aspects of veterinary medicine is the human-animal bond. There is nothing more rewarding and sacred to me than being able to help families navigate the challenging and emotional waters of the end-of-life period. Being there to help families make difficult decisions, provide palliative care, and provide a peaceful and loving passing of their beloved pets, is my mission, and it’s an honor to fulfill.

When I’m not helping families and their fur babies, I enjoy hiking, oil painting, riding horses, seeing Broadway shows, and spending time with my husband, Sean and our baby son, James. We have 4 senior kitties: “Dinah”, “Georgie”, “Piper,” and “Squeak.”

#### About Dr. Lindsay Rosenblitt

After receiving a hamster as a Christmas gift at the age of seven, I knew animals needed to be a part of my life forever. While growing up in Florida, I befriended all sorts of creatures that I encountered in my neighborhood. I could be seen catching and cuddling lizards, snakes (non-venomous!), birds, and especially neighborhood cats. My bond with animals was instantly formed and forever secured. 

I attended veterinary school at the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine. During my first year, I met my future husband who was also completing a professional degree. Upon graduation, we married, moved to his native Connecticut, and I began practicing in Stamford, CT all within one month! Throughout my many years of veterinary medicine, I have enjoyed a variety of experiences. I started my career at a feline-only hospital then transitioned to a traditional general practice. After having my first child, I started a house-call practice, which fit perfectly into my life as a new mother. For the last several years, I have been a part of a general practice where I met wonderful mentors and saw a complexity of internal medicine, emergency and surgical cases. 

Throughout my career, my purpose as a veterinarian has always been to maintain a good quality of life for my patient and prevent suffering. I knew going into the veterinary field that not all illnesses can be cured, and end of life care would be essential. Regardless of the medical condition or treatment plan, my main focus is always to ensure that my patient’s quality of life is top priority. When that quality can no longer be preserved, my purpose is to prevent suffering and ease the end of life transition. The last moments of a pet’s life should reflect the love, dignity, and intense bond that was shared with their family. These ideals are what led me to Lap of Love. 

While not taking care of furry friends, I enjoy trail running outside to experience the beauty of the seasons. I am also a hobbyist baker and love decorating cakes! I share my life with my supportive husband, two amazing kids, and a menagerie of pets. Our home is filled with the joy and companionship of 6 cats, 2 dogs, and 2 hamsters! 

#### About Dr. Morina Pierce

I grew up in a rural Arizona town and attended a small high school. I have wanted to be a veterinarian since I was a toddler when my favorite toys were stuffed animals and a toy veterinary kit. I raised several animals in 4H and FFA, which required me to administer medications as part of their care. 

I attended the University of Arizona for my undergraduate studies and Washington State University for veterinary school. During vet school, I volunteered for the pet loss support line, and I took an end-of-life elective. After graduating, I worked for five years in general practice. I developed a passion for behavior and internal medicine cases, and I love witnessing the human-animal bond on a daily basis.

I feel that euthanasia can be a life-changing and beautiful experience when it is performed correctly. After using Lap of Love vets for two of my own pets, and appreciating their peaceful passings, I joined Lap of Love so I could provide the same service for other families. 

When I am not working, I enjoy backpacking, camping, hiking, horseback riding, playing board games, reading, and spending time with family.

#### About Dr. Elisa Mazzaferro

I grew up in Waterbury, Connecticut, alongside my twin brother and many dogs over the years. My mother remembers me as a child picking up inchworms and kissing ants, and then gently placing them down without harm. We often roamed the neighborhood woods, hunting for salamanders to pass the time. 

Because of my love of animals and passion for science, becoming a veterinarian seemed like a natural choice. I attended the University of Rhode Island, where I obtained my bachelor's and master's degrees in animal science. Following this, I moved west to Michigan State University, where I earned my Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine.

After graduating, I pursued a career in emergency and critical care, which lasted for nearly three decades. It began with an internship at the Veterinary Institute of Trauma, Emergency, and Critical Care in Wisconsin, followed by a residency in emergency and critical care and a PhD in small animal clinical sciences at Colorado State University.

Throughout my years in emergency practice, I frequently guided families in making medical and end-of-life decisions. I have also shared the end-of-life journey with my own pets, and I believe they told me when it was time. I hope to be a source of comfort and compassion for families and their precious furry loved ones in their final time of need by providing euthanasia services through Lap of Love.

I spend my spare time volunteering for the Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care Society, consulting with other veterinarians, and traveling to speak at conferences and experience new cultures and food. I also enjoy gardening, cooking, and spending time with my fiancé, Tom, our two dogs, Kramer and Minnie, and our two Bombay cats, Lulu and Bean
