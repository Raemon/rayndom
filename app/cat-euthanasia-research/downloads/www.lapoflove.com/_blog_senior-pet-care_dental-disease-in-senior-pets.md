During your pet’s lifetime, there is an excellent chance they’ll require professional dental care. Up to 80% of pets have some form of dental disease by age 3, and that percentage increases with age unless steps are taken to reduce plaque and tartar accumulation. While you may be worried about your pet being anesthetized for a dental cleaning, many pets requiring this procedure are seniors, because they tend to have the most periodontal problems.

To keep your senior pet’s mouth in tip-top shape well into their golden years, staying ahead of periodontal issues through routine care and being able to identify dental disease signs are key. 

## What are dental disease signs in senior pets?

You may chalk up your senior pet’s decreased appetite to a disease process, like [kidney disease](/resource-center/common-diseases-in-dogs/chronic-kidney-disease) or [cancer](/blog/common-pet-diseases-and-symptoms/common-types-of-cancer-senior-dogs-and-cats), but poor oral health may be the cause. Other common dental disease signs in senior pets include:

* Red, inflamed gums

* Bleeding gums, or blood in the water or on toys

* Bad breath

* Brown, yellow, or gray plaque and tartar accumulation

* Loose or missing teeth

* Dropping food when eating

* Refusing to eat

Your pet may also paw at their face or develop a lump on their muzzle under their eye, which likely indicates a tooth-root abscess. Although senior pets routinely develop lumps and bumps, a lump that pops up in such a notorious spot as under the eye is rarely from another cause. However, if you notice any of the above signs in your senior pet, contact your veterinarian for a definitive dental disease diagnosis.

## How can I keep my senior pet’s mouth healthy?

Keeping your senior pet’s mouth healthy requires special care and attention, as they may be suffering from other conditions that can cause sore gums, nausea, and a general poor disposition, including refusing to allow toothbrushing. However, keeping their teeth clean provides an immeasurable health benefit, so you may need professional help. Try the following at-home dental care methods to keep your pet’s mouth healthy between dental cleanings:

* Develop good brushing habits — Daily toothbrushing is the gold standard of at-home dental care for pets. With a pet-friendly, fluoride-free toothpaste and a gentle toothbrush, you can scrub away plaque before it can harden into tartar. Focus on the outer surfaces of the teeth, as your pet’s tongue will wipe the inner surfaces clean. 

* Choose healthy chews — Not all chews are created equal for pets. In fact, many are too hard and can damage your pet’s enamel, or fracture their teeth. Avoid antlers, bones, and other hard chews, and instead, opt for dental chews with plaque- and tartar-eliminating features that have been approved by the [Veterinary Oral Health Council.](http://vohc.org/)

* Use plaque deterrent — If your pet is less than amenable to toothbrushing and refuses dental chews, try adding a [plaque deterrent](http://vohc.org/all_accepted_products.html) to their water. A few drops in the water dish can help prevent plaque accumulation and keep your pet’s mouth healthy. 

While daily at-home dental care is an excellent method of keeping your pet’s mouth healthy, you will still need your family veterinarian’s help. Up to 60% of the tooth structure lies below the gum line and cannot be reached through regular toothbrushing, and only professional cleaning can ensure your pet’s teeth are plaque- and tartar-free. 

If your senior pet has been diagnosed with dental disease or a debilitating periodontal condition, your family veterinarian may have additional suggestions for professional dental care that can offer them relief.
