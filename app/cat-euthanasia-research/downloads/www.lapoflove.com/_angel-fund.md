## Dedicated to pets and their families

Lap of Love is dedicated to walking pets and families through the delicate final moments of a pet’s life, allowing for the human-animal bond to remain as undisturbed as possible. But the reality is, many pet parents can’t afford our services. That's why we set up the Lap of Love Angel Fund, which is dedicated to ensuring as many in-need families as possible get to experience a most beautiful and compassionate end-of-life experience with their pet from the comfort of their homes. Would you like to donate to the fund and become an angel today? 

*The Angel Fund is a limited resource only dispersed at Lap of Love's discretion depending on the severity of the need.

## Your donation makes a lasting impact

One of the amazing aspects of the human-animal bond is the fact that it never seems to go away. No matter how long it been since a beloved pet has passed, we remember them, their quirks, and their cuteness like it was yesterday. So when you donate to the Angel Fund to help families and their pets, you're not just donating to support a single passing moment in time—you're donating to an experience that will stay in people’s hearts and minds forever, a moment of immeasurable importance with an impact they’ll feel for the rest of their lives.
