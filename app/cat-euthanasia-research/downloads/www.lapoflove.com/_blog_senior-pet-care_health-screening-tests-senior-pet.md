Throughout your pet’s life, they need yearly wellness checks and health screening tests, but as your pet enters their senior years, they need these tests at least every six months. Your pet is more likely to develop a debilitating illness as they age, but pets are hard-wired to mask all indications they are sick to avoid appearing vulnerable. This means that your senior pet can behave like a young whippersnapper while harboring a life-threatening disease.

## How do I know when my pet is geriatric?

The advances in veterinary medicine and pet owners’ compliance with recommended preventive measures have resulted in pets living longer, more active lives. Your pet may still enjoy playing fetch and continue to wake you up at the same time every morning. They certainly do not act old, so how can you tell when they reach their golden years? Cats are typically considered senior at age 7. For dogs, the milestone depends on their breed. Small-breed dogs are similar to cats and reach their geriatric years at about 7. Large-breed dogs are considered senior pets when they are 5 to 6.

## What does a senior pet wellness check involve?

Senior pet wellness checks are similar to regular ones, but more comprehensive testing may be recommended as your pet ages.

* History — Your veterinarian will want to know about changes in your senior pet’s social interactions, appetite, sleeping habits, mobility, and ability to urinate and defecate. A small change in your pet’s behavior could indicate a significant issue.

* Weight — Your senior pet will be accurately weighed to check for fluctuations from previous visits. A drastic decrease or increase in your pet’s weight can indicate certain disease processes, such as diabetes or cancer, that will need further investigation.

* Physical exam — Your senior pet will be thoroughly examined from head to toe, looking for any abnormalities or causes for concern.

* Complete blood count — This test measures your senior pet’s red and white blood cells, as well as their platelet count. Abnormalities can indicate issues such as anemia, infection, or cancer.

* Biochemistry profile—This test measures your senior pet’s electrolyte levels and organ function and can detect problems such as kidney failure or liver disease. 

* Urinalysis — Your senior pet’s urine will be assessed to determine appearance, concentration, and content. Abnormalities can indicate issues affecting your pet’s kidneys, bladder, and liver. 

* Thyroid testing — Your senior pet’s thyroid hormone levels will be monitored to ensure they remain appropriate. Hypothyroidism is more common in dogs, while hyperthyroidism is more common in cats.

* Breed-specific testing — Certain breeds are more prone to specific diseases and may need further testing to ensure they are unaffected. For example, your veterinarian may recommend advanced cardiac testing for your Doberman or glaucoma screening for your cocker spaniel.

## What disease processes could affect my senior pet?

Your pet is more likely to be affected by specific disease processes as they enter their geriatric years. The earlier these issues are discovered, the better your pet’s prognosis for managing the problem. Common diseases affecting senior pets include:

* [Cognitive dysfunction](/resource-center/common-diseases-in-dogs/cognitive-dysfunction) — Similar to humans with Alzheimer’s disease, your senior pet can suffer from degenerative changes in their brain. Signs include disorientation, social interaction changes, sleep-wake cycle alterations, house soiling, and activity level changes.

* [Heart disease](/resource-center/common-diseases-in-dogs/heart-disease) — Senior pets affected by heart disease may exhibit signs such as lethargy, cough, difficulty breathing, and abdominal swelling. 

* [Kidney disease](/resource-center/common-diseases-in-dogs/chronic-kidney-disease) — Senior cats are especially prone to kidney disease, but senior dogs are also affected. Signs include weight loss, decreased appetite, lethargy, and vomiting.

* [Diabetes](/resource-center/common-diseases-in-dogs/diabetes) — Obese senior pets are at higher risk for diabetes. Signs include increased water intake and urination, chronic or recurring infections, and cloudy eyes. 

Senior pets frequently do not exhibit signs in the early stages of a disease process. Regular health screening tests are the only method to discover these issues before they damage your senior pet’s well-being irreparable. Ask your veterinarian how often your senior pet should be screened to ensure they stay by your side for as long as possible.
