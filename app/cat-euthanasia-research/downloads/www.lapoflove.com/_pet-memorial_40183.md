#### [Captain aka GrampsGramps was one of a kind. Our hearts were made for each other from the start & he will forever be remembered in my household. Morgan Cumming, GeorgiaJanuary 20, 2026](/pet-memorial/40188)[LoadingRollieI love you sweet PoPo, you were the best girl ever!

There will never be a more loyal friend. We will miss her every day.Katie O Fallon, MissouriJanuary 19, 2026](/pet-memorial/40184)[LoadingSadieTo our Sadie lady, the goodest girl, our pocket pittie, littlest house hippo, baked sweet potato, the fan favorite, and the squishiest of squish faces. You truly were the best dog, easy and loving, even when you used your block of a head to ask for more pets. I will miss your little circle zoomies and your little safari out to the tall grasses at the end of the yard. Your snores in the night, your little smile when you slept, and how you would knock every pillow off the sofa just to get comfy. I will miss your dinosaur chomps and maybe even your stinky breath. Rest easy, kind soul, and give Molly snuggles for us. 💔Adam, Dayna and Sophia Caseyville, IllinoisJanuary 19, 2026](/pet-memorial/40183)[LoadingTrigger Trigger, I found you when the world hadn’t been kind to you, and somehow you still chose to trust me. From that moment on, we saved each other. You stood by me through endless roads, changing skies, and every chapter in between as we traveled the United States side by side. You were never just my dog—you were my constant, my protector, my home. You taught me loyalty, resilience, and what unconditional love truly looks like. No matter where we went, I was never alone because I had you. Thank you for choosing me, for surviving, for loving me the way only you could. You will always be the best friend I ever had, and a piece of my heart will forever walk this world with you. Always yours, ❤️ MommaAngela Palm Coast, FloridaJanuary 19, 2026](/pet-memorial/40182)[LoadingMiloMilo was just 8 weeks old when we welcomed him home. Since that day, he has brought our family so many reasons to smile. From the way he followed our movements to ensure he knew our whereabouts to giving his infamous kisses to playing hide and seek. We will forever miss you and the security we felt knowing you were nearby. We love you Big Boy and miss you more than words can express. We take comfort in knowing you are snuggling and running with Charlotte. We love you Milo. Melissa Weddington, North CarolinaJanuary 19, 2026](/pet-memorial/40181)[LoadingSammiLOVE. LOVE beyond words that I have to fully express the deep, deep place you held in our hearts. Your SMILE! Oh, it was glorious! There was nothing that could ever have prepared my husband and I for the pain, loss, and deep grief that we feel after losing our precious girl. You were the center of our lives for 17 years! We miss smashing our faces into your fur. We miss watching you sleep. Small walks at the park (using the doggy stroller in these later years). When you started to get sick, we did everything we could to keep you as healthy and as comfortable as possible. You hid your growing distress too well for us to have seen how sick you were. GOD, baby girl, we miss you. This pain is like nothing either of us knows how to get through. The house is empty without your little spirit. Baby girl, run on the shores of heaven and lie in the cool grass, warmed by the heavenly sunlight until Daddy or I come for you!

I love you forever.Holli Riverside, OhioJanuary 19, 2026](/pet-memorial/40179)
