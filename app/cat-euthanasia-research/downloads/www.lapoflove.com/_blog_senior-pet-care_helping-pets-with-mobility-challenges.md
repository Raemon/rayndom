Pets who are experiencing[mobility](/resource-center/symptom-management/mobility-disorders) challenges may need a helping hand. Whether recovering from injury or illness or managing a progressive disease, decreased mobility may look like your dog having trouble jumping up on the sofa for a snuggle or your cat struggling to get into her covered litter box as quickly as she used to and maintain proper posture once inside. Watching can be challenging and leaves us pet parents powerless about how to help. Fortunately, there are many options worth considering. These include simple environmental adjustments [around the home](/blog/senior-pet-care/5-simple-tips-help-senior-pet-navigate-home), affordable equipment, tools, or supplements you can discuss with your veterinary care team to support your pet. 

## Provide easy access

* Consider a ramp to bypass steps into the home and to get in and out of the car. If a ramp initially seems intimidating for your pet, try laying it flat on the floor to allow them to get used to walking on it this way and improve their confidence, then gradually increase the incline to encourage the transition.

* Pet-friendly stairs can be placed next to furniture to reduce the need for jumping onto a couch or bed. 

* Elevate food and water bowls to shoulder height to make them easier to reach and reduce neck strain.

* Reduce available square footage so your pet doesn’t need to travel as far to reach the necessities.

* For kitties, consider creating a “hospice suite” with everything they need in one peaceful, quiet area. Include a low-edged litter box for a more accessible entrance and exit. This is especially helpful if other pets in the home or multiple cats have historically shared a box; it’s time for a spot all their own! A separate space could also reduce stress and thereby reduce inappropriate urination.

## Traction is key

* Keep the fur between paw pads as short as possible to reduce slipping, and keep nails short. If [grooming](/blog/senior-pet-care/essential-tips-for-senior-pet-grooming) outside the home has become stressful for your pet, consider having a mobile grooming service come to you. 

* Roll out the red carpet: If you have slippery flooring like hardwood or tile, putting down yoga mats or carpet runners can provide more traction, especially in high-traffic areas and in front of food and water dishes. 

* If your pet allows, traction aids such as [PawFriction](https://pawtology.com/) and traction booties can give another boost if needed. 

## Support your pet while reducing strain on you

* Full-body harnesses with handles can be helpful for pets with generalized mobility challenges (such as osteoarthritis affecting multiple joints). Many such harnesses are designed to be comfortable enough to wear all the time, so they can always be in place to help at a moment’s notice.

* Consider a sling if your pet has more specific rear or fore-limb mobility difficulty, like osteosarcoma in one affected limb. Large beach towels can work in a pinch. 

* Use harnesses and slings for potty breaks, to navigate stairs, and during walks and outside time; they can also help in a mobility emergency.

## Take it up a notch

* Assisi Loop® products utilize Targeted Pulsed Electromagnetic Field Therapy (tPEMF™) to trigger the body’s natural anti-inflammatory process, which can reduce discomfort and improve mobility. 

* Passive range of motion (PROM) exercises can improve joint mobility. Start slowly and follow your pet’s lead. These movements are new, so some initial resistance and reluctance are normal. Using heat therapy beforehand can help ease the movements.

* There are over-the-counter veterinary supplements that are specially formulated to alleviate joint degeneration. Discuss with your care team whether these may be appropriate for your pet! 

## More extensive support

Discuss with your veterinary care team whether these in-clinic treatments/modalities or prescriptions may be appropriate for your pet: 

* Cold laser therapy

* Acupuncture 

* Physical therapy 

* Prescription-strength comfort care (NSAIDs and neuropathic pain medications)

* Librela (canine) and Solensia (feline) injections for the management of arthritic pain

If you think mobility affects your senior pet’s quality of life, use our quality of life [scoring tools](/quality-of-life-assessment) or our [telehospice service](/our-services/telehospice) to help make important decisions about their future. If your pet is suffering despite treatment, it may be time to consider [in-home euthanasia](/our-services/in-home-euthanasia) to help your pet pass with dignity and peace.
