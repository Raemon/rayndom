#### About Dr. Carling Sitterley

My interest in veterinary medicine began my junior year of high school, when I was fortunate enough to shadow a local veterinarian as part of a school requirement. Veterinary medicine has been a large part of my life ever since that first experience. Over the years, I have come to realize being a veterinarian is as much about supporting people as it is about helping animals. I truly enjoy that I am able to do both in my career.

Born in central New York, I grew up near Lynchburg, Virginia. I stayed in Virginia for both college and veterinary school. After receiving a bachelor’s degree in biology at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, I moved to Blacksburg, Virginia, where I attended the Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine at Virginia Tech and earned both a doctor of veterinary medicine (DVM) degree and a master of public health (MPH) degree.

In 2017, I moved to South Central Pennsylvania to join Lap of Love. It is an area I visited frequently in my childhood to spend holidays with extended family. Although my extended family has since moved out of the region, I love being here with my partner, two cats, and a clingy poodle mix pup. We're surrounded by such a wonderful sense of community and gorgeous landscape. When I am not working with clients and their furry loved ones, I spend time exploring area hikes and otherwise finding ways to be outside or to explore the gems Pennsylvania has to offer in terms of food and points of interest.

Prior to me moving to Pennsylvania, I had a kitty named Tigger, whom I affectionately called my “forever foster.” She only lived with me for the second half of her life and experienced chronic kidney disease for much of that time. In August of 2015, when Tigger’s quality of life was no longer what I wanted for her, I decided to drive an hour with her to have a very close friend and veterinarian perform the compassionate act of euthanasia for her. The whole process of saying goodbye to Tigger ended up being more difficult for me than I anticipated, and I found it especially valuable to have someone I trusted perform the euthanasia and be there to support and comfort me afterward.

While I may be meeting you for the first time, I strive to act in ways that allow every family to feel the same level of trust, support, and comfort that I experienced at Tigger’s passing. I have also felt the pain of saying goodbye to two more kitties, Chewie and Frankie. It seems saying goodbye to your own fur babies gets more difficult each time. I hold these experiences close when I am helping families and their beloved pets. If I can make a difficult time for you and your fur baby the slightest bit easier, I will have done the job I set out to do.

#### About Dr. Nikki Abdulla

I grew up in rural western Pennsylvania with my grandparents. Because my grandmother was compassionate, kind-hearted, and had a huge soft spot for all animals, our household was full of dogs and cats that had shown up on our doorstep as strays, as well as the occasional gerbil or rabbit. It was not unusual for us to take in baby birds, rabbits, and kittens to nurse back to health; they always became members of the family. My grandmother taught me that we have a duty towards other living creatures in need. I also learned from her that our pets add so much joy to our lives and give their love unconditionally to those who are kind to them. 

As a teenager, I began working in my aunt’s small animal veterinary clinic cleaning cages, doing laundry, and walking dogs. As I got older, I began to shadow her in appointments and observe patient treatments in addition to surgery. I watched as my aunt helped pets and their families from their early years to end of life and it was at this point that I developed the desire to become a veterinarian. I knew it was my calling to help families and their cherished companions in any way that I could. 

After graduating from The Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine, I worked in both general practice and emergency medicine. During my years in emergency medicine, I was privileged to assist families and pets through some of the most difficult times in their lives. Some of the most fulfilling moments in my career have involved guiding families through providing their pets with palliative care and through the process of saying goodbye. When I moved to the Harrisburg area and discovered Lap of Love, I knew immediately that it was the right fit for me. I believe that the ability to provide relief from suffering is one of the greatest gifts that we can give our cherished companions. It is my honor to be able to help families keep their beloved companions comfortable for as long as possible and help guide them through a peaceful passing in their own homes.

#### About Dr. Pamela Datsko

I grew up in the small town of Ebensburg, Pennsylvania—my high school’s graduating class was only about 100 students. It was here that I discovered my love of nature, and the joy that animals bring us. You could say I was born to be a veterinarian. As soon as I knew what the word meant, I had no doubt that’s what I would be. Shadowing a local veterinarian in high school cemented my desire, because I loved every minute of the experience.

I attended Indiana University of Pennsylvania for my undergraduate studies before completing veterinary school at Michigan State University. I received a well rounded, real-world education at MSU and appreciate everyone who was a part of my experience there. 

After graduation, I spent 30 years working in small animal medicine and developed a passion for surgery, because it allowed me to cure a pet’s condition. However, not all pets can be saved, and I learned a lot about the power of the human-animal bond from my time supporting clients during their pet’s end of life. It was difficult to provide a peaceful, individualized end-of-life experience in the clinic setting, and as my career developed, I realized that I wanted to provide better end-of-life care for my patients. 

When someone loses a pet, they lose a family member who has given them the truest form of unconditional love—a family member who has supported them through trials and shared in their times of joy. Our pets deserve the ending we want for ourselves—in familiar surroundings with loved ones nearby, a last treat or hug, and release from pain. I am honored to be able to provide this for pets and their families through my role at Lap of Love. 

When I’m not working I love to ride my Morgan mare, Maya—she and I have become quite the team over the last 12 years—and go on adventures with my two dogs, Bandit and Chloe. I also enjoy creating acrylic-poured art and traveling. 

#### About Dr. Vanessa Tagg

I grew up in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania. My father was a veterinarian and my mother was an animal-loving elementary school counselor, so we always had several pets. However, it wasn't until college, when I started volunteering at a local shelter and wildlife rehabilitation center, and I adopted the cat of my life, Haggis, that I seriously considered a career in veterinary medicine. 

I earned my bachelor’s degree from the University of Pittsburgh with a double major in Japanese and anthropology in 2006. I completed all my prerequisite coursework for veterinary school as a post-baccalaureate at Pitt. I attended veterinary school at Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine in St. Kitts and completed my clinical year at the University of Missouri. I was awarded my Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine with honors in May 2014. 

I've worked in small animal general practice in State College and Williamsport, Pennsylvania, and mobile wellness services throughout the state. I like being a vet because our animal family members give us so much, and they deserve as good a life (and death) as we can give them in return. 

The bond between people and their pets is central to everything I do as a veterinarian. I want to always honor that relationship and help owners focus on the wonderful life their pet had, rather than the pet's death. I feel privileged to glimpse the depth of love and affection between people and their pets at such a profound time in their lives, and being there for people in those moments is so fulfilling. 

I've always viewed euthanasia as one of the greatest honors of our profession. We can bring beloved pets peace at the end of their lives, and hold space for the heartfelt grief of their human family. In that sense, perhaps I came pre-molded for this type of work. 

My other interests include reading, live music, and travel. My husband is my best friend, and we have a son who keeps us busy. We also have two cats (Wikket and Fishstick), a hamster (Freeze), a yellow lab (Bogey), and tropical fish.

#### About Dr. Amy Fish

I am a Lancaster, Pennsylvania native. Although I moved away for college and veterinary school, I somehow ended up right back where I started. 

I have been interested in animals since I was young, but I was never sure exactly how I wanted to work with them. After some exploration, I settled on becoming a veterinarian because it would allow me to make the biggest difference for pets and their families.

I completed my undergraduate degree in animal and veterinary science, with a minor in classical studies, at the University of Maine. From there, I went abroad and received my veterinary degree from the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies in Edinburgh, Scotland.

I have worked in small animal general practice for five years and enjoy making long-lasting relationships with clients and their pets. I’ve helped many families say goodbye to their beloved pets and I’m honored to be present during such a meaningful and vulnerable moment. Hearing families recount stories of their pets warms my heart and reminds me of my bond with my own beloved animals.

My heart dog, Rocky, hated going to the veterinary hospital. Soon after finishing veterinary school, I found cancer in Rocky’s lungs. When he began to decline, the last thing I wanted to do was drag him into the hospital. Fortunately, an amazing colleague helped him pass in the comfort of our home. From that point on, I’ve wanted to help other families and pets feel equally comfortable and reassured during their pet’s final moments.

Outside of work, I love spending time with my husband and our three cats, Lemon, Pepper, and Tikka. I also enjoy traveling and spending time on the beach. At home, I love to knit, crotchet, quilt, and bake. When I'm not being crafty, I play rugby with a local women's team.
