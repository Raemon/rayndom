Our pets’ grooming needs evolve with age, and special attention is necessary during the senior years to ensure comfort and safety. Joint pain, muscle weakness, skin conditions, and behavior or personality changes can contribute to grooming difficulties. Yet, grooming is essential for your pet’s overall wellness and should remain a priority well into their golden years.

## Senior pet grooming benefits

As they age, pets often require more frequent grooming because their skin, hair coat, nails, and overall health change. Arthritic pets struggle to groom themselves and may become excessively oily and flaky or develop a foul odor from bacterial or yeast overgrowth on the skin. Nail quality may decline, and hair may become matted or brittle. To counteract these changes and assist the immune system in keeping the microbiome in balance, we recommend frequent grooming, nail trims, and ear cleanings.

## Finding a professional groomer

One solution is to find a professional groomer who is well-versed in senior pet grooming needs. Mobile grooming professionals can be a fantastic, low-stress option that doesn’t require your pet to leave home. Your veterinarian’s office may also cater their grooming services to older pets or those with health issues, such as sedation for highly stressed or anxious pets.

## Skin and coat care for senior pets

Between professional grooming services, you can keep your pet’s coat fresh and clean with brushing and bathing at home. Brushing helps spread natural oils through the coat, removes loose hairs, and helps prevent matting. Choose a soft-bristled brush or rubber curry comb so you don’t hurt sensitive skin, and pay close attention to areas prone to tangles or debris, including the ears, armpits, and [hind end](/blog/senior-pet-care/why-does-my-senior-pet-have-diarrhea).

When bathing your pet, provide a non-slip surface with a bath mat or towel and use warm, soothing water. Ask your veterinarian or groomer for recommendations or a prescription shampoo to control active skin conditions. Afterward, gently towel dry your pet and keep them warm until their coat dries naturally—use a blow dryer on low only if your pet tolerates the noise.

Many cat owners are surprised that their cats will often tolerate and appreciate a bath as much as dogs. While young cats typically groom themselves sufficiently, older cats can become greasy and matted if pain prevents adequate self-grooming. Cat grooming is best accomplished in a shallow sink with a detachable, gentle sprayer.

## Nail trims for senior pets

Regular nail trimming prevents long or brittle nails from painful breaking or tearing, which can lead to infection. Keeping nails short can also help pets with [joint pain](/blog/senior-pet-care/is-my-senior-pet-in-pain) or muscle weakness become more mobile by increasing paw pad contact with the ground. However, nail trims can be stressful for many pets and pet owners. When trimming your pet’s nails at home, enlist a partner to feed your pet tasty treats and trim the nails while your pet is lying down in comfort.

## Ear cleaning for senior pets

When you bathe your pet, you should also clean its ears to remove excess wax buildup and prevent infections. Use only a veterinarian-approved ear cleansing solution and cotton balls—not cotton swabs—to gently wipe away debris. Do not dig deep into the ear canal, which can harm the eardrum. If you notice redness or excessive debris, contact your veterinarian.

## Special considerations for senior pets

Successfully grooming a senior pet requires special care and accommodations. Consider the following strategies for a safe and effective grooming session:

* Groom your pet in a familiar, temperature-controlled environment. Avoid bathing outdoors in [cold weather](/blog/senior-pet-health-and-safety/4-ways-to-keep-your-senior-pet-comfortable-in-cold-weather).

* Short, frequent sessions are better than long, infrequent sessions because they minimize joint discomfort and stress. Make grooming a regular part of your routine.

* Use non-slip mats and surfaces during the entire grooming process.

* Pair unpleasant grooming procedures with frequent rewards, such as treats or toys, to help your pet develop a positive association with the grooming process.

* Do not use scissors to cut your senior pet’s hair because you can easily cut their fragile, thin skin. If you want a home haircut, use clippers with a blade guard.

* Learn to identify pain or [distress](/blog/senior-pet-care/how-to-understand-senior-cat-body-language) and stop the grooming session if your pet appears uncomfortable.

* Approach the grooming process with patience and compassion.

Grooming senior pets is about maintaining their physical appearance and providing them with care and comfort. Keeping them clean and fresh helps them feel their best and reduces pain and discomfort, an essential aspect of quality of life. If your senior pet develops incontinence or [mobility issues](http://resource-center/symptom-management/mobility-disorders) that make keeping them clean difficult, contact us to [discuss their quality of life](/our-services/telehospice) and whether [veterinary hospice](/our-services/veterinary-hospice) care may be a helpful solution.
