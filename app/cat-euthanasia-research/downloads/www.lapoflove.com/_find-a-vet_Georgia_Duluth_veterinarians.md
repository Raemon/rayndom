#### About Dr. Selena Taylor

I was born in Indiana, and aside from a few years in Colorado, I spent my childhood in Indianapolis. As a child, Indianapolis felt like a huge city, and It was a great place to grow up with a lot to do, such as watching the local sports teams, camping, fishing, and shopping. 

Growing up, my father always told me, "Whatever you do in life make sure you enjoy it; the money will work itself out." Those wise words stuck with me, and I can honestly say that I’m doing what I love. The challenges and rewards that come with caring for animals and supporting the human-animal bond are what called me to become a veterinarian and still bring me a deep sense of fulfillment every day. 

I completed my undergraduate studies at Alcorn State University in Mississippi and attended veterinary school at Tuskegee University in Alabama. 

I have been practicing veterinary medicine at a small animal clinic for 18 years, and one of my favorite parts of my job is connecting with my clients. It feels good to be doing my part to improve the lives of pets and therefore the lives of their families. 

Losing a pet is never easy. Over the years I have lost two guinea pigs, one cat, and one dog, and one of the toughest parts of saying goodbye was putting each of those pets in the car for their last ride to the clinic. Although my pets didn't know why they were going for a ride, my family and I did, and that was tough. I appreciate that my Lap of Love role allows me to take that step away from families by providing at-home end-of-life care. It is a gift for pets to pass comfortably in a familiar place surrounded by their family, and it makes saying goodbye a little easier for people. Providing this service speaks to my heart and is a way to continue supporting the precious human-animal bond. 

Outside of work, I enjoy being active and working out. Additionally, I am always working on a DIY project around the house, my car, or our yard, or helping a friend with their projects. 

#### About Dr. Kathleen Storves

I was born in Birmingham, Alabama but grew up in Raleigh, North Carolina. I remember deciding I wanted to be a veterinarian when I was in kindergarten. I loved animals and even wrote about my dream job in my "All About Me" book in pre-kindergarten. 

I knew I wanted to understand the way animals work, so I pursued a degree in biological sciences at Clemson University. After that, I attended the University of Georgia College of Veterinary Medicine and completed a residency program at the University of Michigan. Despite all that, I’m still an Auburn Tiger by birth! 

As a veterinarian, my interests include internal medicine (because I love solving problems) and behavior—I find it so important for a pet’s well-being—and their owner’s! I have worked with a huge variety of species and pigs have surprised me the most. They are so smart! 

My first personal pet was a super sassy Tortie cat named Emmy. She was my steadfast companion through college and veterinary school. I knew her the best, so I knew when it was time to say goodbye. It was the most difficult and best decision I made for her. She had always been anxious in the car—despite our extensive travels—so I wanted to provide a comforting environment. With the help of a veterinarian colleague, Emmy was able to pass at home. 

I believe in-home end-of-life care is the most incredible service we can provide for pet parents. Allowing them to experience the grief and sadness of this terrible day in the comfort of their home, in a safe space, and with no judgment—only love—is the most rewarding part of this career. 

Outside of veterinary medicine, I am a competitive tennis player and a Jazzercise instructor! When I’m not on the court or in the studio, I love to read, watch my girls dance and play sports, and travel with my husband.

#### About Dr. Amber Williams

I grew up on my family’s farm in rural Georgia, where I developed an enthusiastic love for animals and being outdoors. I became “Dr. Amber” when I graduated from the University of Georgia’s College of Veterinary Medicine. After vet school, I stayed in the Atlanta area to be close to family and friends. 

For many years, I treated critically ill pets in an urgent care environment. There, I developed a wealth of clinical expertise and a deep appreciation for end-of-life care for our beloved pets. I strongly believe in helping pet parents provide a loving and peaceful goodbye for pets by allowing them to stay in the comfort of their own homes and avoid the stress of a hospital visit. 

When I’m not helping pets and their families, I enjoy spending time with my husband and son and snuggling with my own pets: a large tabby cat named JJ and our one-eyed, special needs dog, Ava. You can also find me working with stained glass, baking bread, watching Jeopardy, and rooting for the Georgia Bulldogs.
