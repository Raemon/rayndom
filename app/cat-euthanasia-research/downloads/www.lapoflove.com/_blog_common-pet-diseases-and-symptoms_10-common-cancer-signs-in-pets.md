Thanks to dedicated pet owners, high-quality nutrition, and preventive medicine, pets are living longer than ever. Sadly, an unforeseen side effect of an increased lifespan is an increased cancer risk.[The National Cancer Institute](https://ccr.cancer.gov/Comparative-Oncology-Program/pet-owners/what-is-comp-onc) estimates roughly 6 million new cancer diagnoses are made in dogs each year, with a similar number in cats. However, pets do not all receive annual veterinary care or receive a definitive cancer diagnosis, so these numbers may be higher. More studies and statistics are available on canine cancers, since more dogs than cats visit their veterinarian. Based on current information, the [Veterinary Cancer Society](http://vetcancersociety.org/pet-owners/faqs/) estimates that one in four dogs will develop cancer at some point, and almost 50% of dogs over age 10 will develop cancer. Fortunately, half of all canine cancers are treatable if caught early enough. More research is needed to gain a deeper understanding of feline cancers.

Many cancers are more common in older pets, but if you can recognize the potential cancer signs, you can take prompt action, and minimize the disease spread. Monitor your pet’s health, and schedule an appointment with your family veterinarian if you notice any of the following potential cancer warning signs:

## #1: Abnormal swellings or lumps that change rapidly

A key cancer clue that is obvious to pet owners is a lump or bump that appears suddenly, or an existing mass that changes rapidly. While many lumps are benign, an equal number are malignant. If a new bump pops up on your pet, or an existing one begins to grow, schedule an appointment with your family veterinarian for cytology or biopsy.

## #2: Sores that do not heal 

A sore may not heal simply because your pet won’t stop licking at it, but, if that’s not the case, a non-healing wound is cause for concern. Whether the sore is resistant to antibiotics, or a more serious issue, a sore that fails to heal requires veterinary attention.

## #3: Decreased appetite

With many pets, almost nothing will disrupt their eating, and a decreased appetite clearly indicates a problem. In picky pets, a decreased appetite is more difficult to judge, but any time your pet goes off their food, it’s time for a physical exam and diagnostic workup, because lack of appetite can be a sign of pain, acute illness, or a serious disease.

## #4: Weight loss

Unexplained weight loss in pets is often a sign of a serious underlying issue, and is always a concern. Pets suffering from hidden disease processes like cancer can rapidly lose weight, despite a good appetite, and an unchanged exercise regimen. If your pet is losing weight, they will likely need additional nutritional support to maintain decent health.

## #5: Lameness

While limping and lameness is common in older pets suffering from osteoarthritis, lameness that does not resolve with rest and medication can indicate a nerve or bone cancer, like [osteosarcoma](/resource-center/common-diseases-in-dogs/osteosarcoma). When limping is accompanied by a hard, swollen area on the affected limb, or any combination of other cancer warning signs, schedule an immediate appointment with your family veterinarian.

## #6: Lethargy

Pets with cancer feel unwell, and may refuse to play, or participate in their favorite activities. Cancer can sap the body of strength, cause anemia, or create pain, making your pet weak, lethargic, and depressed.

## #7: Gastrointestinal problems

Vomiting and diarrhea are two of the most common issues veterinarians see, but chronic gastrointestinal problems that do not resolve can indicate an underlying cancer process. Tumors in the gastrointestinal tract often lead to chronic vomiting and diarrhea.

## #8: Difficulty eating or swallowing

Oral cancers are common in [cats ](/resource-center/common-diseases-in-cats/oral-tumors)and [dogs](/resource-center/common-diseases-in-dogs/oral-tumors), and can make chewing or swallowing extremely painful or difficult.

## #9: Coughing or difficulty breathing

Many cancers can metastasize (i.e., spread) to the spleen, liver, and lungs. Tumors that spread to your pet’s [lungs ](/resource-center/common-diseases-in-dogs/lung-tumors)can cause coughing, or rapid, shallow breathing that requires increased effort.

## #10: Bleeding or discharge from any body area

Bleeding or abnormal discharge can be a sign of infection, injury, or cancer. If you notice blood coming from your pet’s nose or mouth, or in their stool or urine, or bruises forming, contact your family veterinarian.

By keeping a close eye on your pet for potential health issues, you can quickly spot problems, and get them prompt care and treatment, which offers the best prognosis.

If your pet has been diagnosed with terminal cancer, you may choose to support your beloved companion through their final moments with [hospice care](/our-services/veterinary-hospice). Prepare yourself for the inevitable by learning more about [in-home euthanasia](/our-services/in-home-euthanasia), or contact a Lap of Love veterinarian in [your area](/find-a-vet) for more advice on keeping your pet comfortable through the end.
