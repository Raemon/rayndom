After a lifetime of showering your senior pet with love and affection, you likely think your bond could not become even stronger. However, you can participate in many activities to strengthen your bond and deepen your relationship. Try the following five activities to show your furry companion how much they mean to you.

## #1: Engage in daily grooming sessions with your senior pet

Aging pets often develop conditions like osteoarthritis that no longer allow them to self-groom properly. If your furry friend cannot comfortably stretch to groom their sides and hind legs, their hair coat can become matted and dull, and they may develop dry skin. Trimming their nails regularly will help your senior pet walk more easily on slick floors, and you should consider applying a traction aid to their nails, like [Dr. Buzby’s ToeGrips](https://toegrips.com/). Senior pets may also become incontinent, so use waterless shampoo to spot clean dirty areas and limit full baths that can strip healthy oils from your pet’s skin. Help your pet look beautiful and feel their best by brushing them daily, keeping a close eye on their nails, and bathing them as needed to maintain good hygiene. 

## #2: Play brain games with your senior pet

Many senior pets suffer from cognitive dysfunction, but you can help keep their mental facilities sharp. Make a point of playing daily games to exercise your pet’s body and mind. Food puzzles, which encourage your pet to use their brain to access their meal, are a self-rewarding activity. You can create your food puzzles or hide strong-smelling treats around your home to entice your pet to sniff out their snacks.

## #3: Exercise with your senior pet

In addition to exercising your senior pet’s brain, you must motivate them to move their body. Older pets can lose muscle mass or become overweight without regular exercise, putting more strain on painful, arthritic joints. Daily exercise will not only keep your furry companion in good shape but will also provide them with plenty of one-on-one bonding time with you. Consider hiking a different trail with your dog or a new chase toy for your cat to encourage more physical activity and help keep them young and healthy.

## #4: Teach your old dog (or cat) a new trick

Your senior pet may have a vast repertoire of tricks hidden up their furry sleeve, but they can still learn new skills. Whether teaching your cat to high-five or your dog to burrow under a blanket, training sessions are another great way to strengthen your bond. You and your furry companion will become closer than ever by using positive reinforcement techniques to reward correct behavior rather than punish incorrect actions. You can also use your daily training sessions to practice old obedience commands.

## #5: Create a bucket list for your senior pet

Although bucket lists typically involve cramming as much fun as possible into a pet’s final life stages, you can create a bucket list that spans months or years. Add your pet’s favorite activities to their bucket list—something simple, like a kiddie-size ice cream cone for your pooch, or more complex, like the ultimate climbing tower and lookout station for your cat. Spend as much time as possible with your pet participating in enjoyable activities, and your relationship will grow.

Your pet may be getting older, but seniors often still have plenty of time to enjoy their golden years.
