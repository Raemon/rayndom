#### About Dr. Alexa Spittler

I grew up in the small town of Morton, Illinois—the pumpkin capital of the world—with a love for animals, science, and helping others. After working at a local veterinary clinic during high school, I knew that veterinary medicine was the career for me. 

I completed my bachelor’s degree in animal sciences at the University of Illinois, and then earned my veterinary degree from the University of Missouri. Following graduation, I moved to Fort Collins, Colorado to complete my residency and a master’s degree at Colorado State University. 

As a board-certified research veterinarian, I studied treatments for musculoskeletal diseases in pets, such as osteoarthritis—a common and extremely painful condition many pets develop during their senior years. Through this work, I developed a passion for pain management and quality of life for aging pets. I transitioned into a career in end-of-life-care, where I knew I could make a difference for pets and their families during one of the most challenging times of their lives. 

My husband serves in the United States Space Force, which prompted our recent move to Colorado Springs. I am so grateful for the opportunity to expand Lap of Love’s services to this area to provide the most peaceful end-of-life experience for every pet and family I have the honor of serving. 

Outside of work, I enjoy traveling, hiking, snowshoeing, playing trivia, spending time with my family and friends, cheering on the Chicago Bears and the Illinois Fighting Illini, and spoiling my cat, Mosby! 

#### About Dr. Christina Kellogg

I was born in Elgin, Illinois. My father was in the army, so we traveled a bit—from Washington to Germany—when I was young. We finally landed in Colorado, and despite living in several locations throughout the state, I consider it my home. 

I knew from a young age that I wanted to become a veterinarian. I have always had a deep love and respect for all types of animals. Starting at a young age, I began volunteering for any animal-related program I could find, including Guide Dogs for the Blind and the humane society. 

I attended Colorado State University for both undergraduate and veterinary school. I have always enjoyed working as a general practitioner—I love following pets from healthy puppy appointments to their senior years, and being there for all their health needs in between. I have particular interests in neurology, internal medicine, and exotic animal medicine. 

I am so grateful to have been able to say goodbye to all of my close animal companions in the comfort of home. I appreciated not having to take my pets into a noisy, busy hospital, which would have caused them added stress. Instead, each experience was beautiful and positive. I have always wanted to provide other animal lovers with that experience as well. 

Outside of work, I enjoy many hobbies. I am an orchid enthusiast and I grow and care for a large collection of orchids. I love taking care of reptiles and learning their husbandry needs—I currently have a bearded dragon and a leopard gecko. I also recently started learning and practicing archery.

#### About Dr. Audrey Clark

Growing up in sunny Palm Harbor, Florida—about 15 minutes from the beach—sand and surf were staples of my childhood. Animals were another childhood staple, and I naturally gravitated toward them for as long as I can remember. By second grade, I had already decided I would grow up to become a veterinarian, and my parents still have my elementary school "autobiography" to prove it. I got my first taste of veterinary medicine when I was 15 years old, volunteering at the veterinary clinic where we took our family dog. Needless to say, the experience further proved that this was the career path I was meant to follow. 

I received undergraduate degrees in Spanish and animal science from the University of Florida in Gainesville before attending veterinary school at the University of California-Davis, where I earned my Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine. 

I have spent time working in general practice and emergency medicine, and I enjoy aspects of both types of care. Being a veterinarian is so empowering because we are equipped with the tools to provide preventive care, treatment, and surgical procedures for a wide variety of conditions. In addition to providing pets with medical care, we are also advocates for our furry friends who need us to be their voice. 

Growing up, I had two dogs, both of whom passed away after I left for college. I wish I had been at home with my family and pets for their passing to provide comfort and support. Providing at-home end-of-life care is a special way to honor the bond between our furry friends and their family during an extremely emotionally challenging time. If I make the experience just a little more peaceful for everyone involved, then I will have done my part. 

In addition to veterinary medicine, I enjoy spending time outside—my fiance and I hike and camp in the summer, and ski in the winter—and taking advantage of nature’s playground in Colorado. I also enjoy participating in spin classes on my Peloton bike and going to concerts and music festivals around the country.
