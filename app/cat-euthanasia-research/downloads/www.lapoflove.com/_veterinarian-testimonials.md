Dr. Alexa

We decided to use in home hospice for our 17-year-old cat Sophie. Dr. Alexa was very compassionate with us and explained everything well. Our cat got to be in her favorite place when she passed which was so comforting. The thought of taking her to an in-person vet filled us with despair. I so appreciated Dr. Alexa being kind and respectful of us and Sophie. It made a horrible experience a bit easier. I would highly recommend in home hospice care in the sad event that you need that.

Dr. Angela

Dr. Angela was an angel sent to us in human form. She is exactly what our family needed on this dreaded day. She came with grace and put my baby down with dignity and compassion. Angela was upfront and honest about the procedure and she was kind and she cared about our feelings. She didn't rush us to say our goodbye. I cant say enough about the care and expertise she offered. Thank you so very much!
