Pain can seriously affect your senior pet’s quality of life. Unfortunately, many common health conditions in older pets, such as dental disease,[osteoarthritis](/resource-center/common-diseases-in-dogs/osteoarthritis), and cancer, are painful in varying degrees. Recognizing pain signs in your senior pet is important so you can provide them relief, and they can continue to live the best life possible. The following signs may mean that your pet is in pain, and should visit your family veterinarian.

## #1: Decreased appetite

A pet’s less-than-healthy appetite can indicate a variety of problems and always warrants a veterinary evaluation. If your pet does not receive regular dental evaluations and cleanings, dental disease may be to blame. As dental disease progresses, tooth roots decay, and infections fester, which can become severely painful. A number of other pain-causing diseases are also possible, and a thorough veterinary exam can identify the origin.

## #2: Hiding or withdrawing from activity

When you don’t feel well, you curl up under a blanket and keep to yourself, and your pet may do the same. If your cat has been hiding under the couch, or your dog has no interest in their daily walk or playtime, they may be painful, and trying to move as little as possible. 

## #3: Hunched-up posture

Abdominal discomfort often causes pets to assume a hunched-up posture to protect their vulnerable belly. Any of your pet’s abdominal organs, such as their stomach, intestines, kidneys, or liver, can be a source of pain. You may also notice your pet walking stiffly to guard their painful abdomen. 

## #4: Urinating on the floor

If your cat is suffering from bladder pain caused by [cystitis](/resource-center/common-diseases-in-cats/flutd), they may feel an increased urgency to urinate, and may not get to their litter box in time. Your dog may have an accident in the house if they have arthritis, and can’t get outside quickly enough.

## #5: Biting or nipping

Your painful older pet may become grumpy, and feel the need to defend themselves from unwanted attention. If you try to coax your cat from their hiding spot, or a child pets your painful dog, they may lash out in response. A normally laid-back, social pet who bites often indicates pain, and warrants further investigation.

## #6: Poor hair coat

Cats normally spend a good part of their day grooming themselves to maintain their coats. But, if your cat is painful, and minimizes activity and movement to avoid further discomfort, they may forego this task. You should be concerned if your cat is looking more scruffy than usual, or their typically well-groomed coat has become matted.

## #7: Limping

Limping is a more obvious pain sign in pets that can be caused by many conditions, including arthritis and bone cancer (i.e.,[ osteosarcoma](/resource-center/common-diseases-in-dogs/osteosarcoma)). Your family veterinarian can identify the source of your pet’s limp, and tailor an individual treatment plan. Most pets with arthritis find relief from a combination of medications and alternative therapies, such as laser therapy, acupuncture, or therapeutic exercises. Unfortunately, osteosarcoma carries a poor prognosis, and may require surgery, chemotherapy, or palliative therapy.

## #8: Restlessness

Pain can interfere with your pet’s ability to get comfortable and settle, particularly at bedtime. If your pet repeatedly gets up and down, pants excessively, or licks or bites at a specific body area, they are likely uncomfortable.

## #9: Trembling

Your older pet may tremble, or shake, for a variety of reasons. But, if your pet is painful, and anxious about their situation, their sympathetic nervous system may become activated. This “fight or flight” response can cause your pet to tremble, in addition to an increased heart rate, pupillary dilation, and decreased appetite. 

## #10: Vocalizing

If your pet is crying or whining, they are likely painful, and trying to convey their discomfort. Your senior pet obviously cannot talk, but may choose to vocalize their concerns, in the hope that you will help alleviate their pain. If your pet is crying out for help, schedule an appointment with your family veterinarian right away.

If you think pain is affecting your senior pet’s quality of life, use our [quality of life scoring tools](/how-will-i-know-it-is-time/lap-of-love-quality-of-life-scale.pdf), or our [telehospice service](/our-services/telehospice), to help make important decisions about their future.
