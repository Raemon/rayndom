#### About Dr. Jessica Wilbourne

Since I could remember, I have always had a drive to understand the world around me. I would ask why things happen, how they work, why things fall apart and how we put them back together. For me, the ultimate questions of why we lose things in our lives has led me to the confluence of events that surround those moments. Trying to understand the 'why' became nil to the experience of simply letting go, offering comfort to our fellow man/animal, and to find a sense of peace and bravery in living in that moment.

I grew up in beautiful Bucks County, PA, surrounded by family, friends and animals. After graduating from Arizona State University with a degree in biology, I worked and traveled before ultimately earning my veterinary degree from the Royal Veterinary College in London, UK. Studying abroad was an amazing experience that opened my eyes to new cultures, people and ideas, and allowed me to travel the world to explore places like Africa, Sri Lanka, Indonesia and throughout Europe. Following veterinary school, I completed a small animal rotating internship at Hickory Veterinary Hospital in Plymouth Meeting, PA, and then moved to Guam to work as a civilian in a U.S. Army military hospital. After Guam, I then worked in small animal practice in Florida and Pennsylvania, before joining Lap of Love.

Having traveled the world, I have returned home to Bucks County where I enjoy spending time with family, friends and even more animals. I hope to offer relief and comfort to those I meet and I am honored to assist in the peaceful transition of our beloved pets to the next stage.

#### About Dr. Janet Schultz

I’m originally from the South Shore of Long Island but we relocated to Pennsylvania in 1990 when I was 16. I grew up boating in the Center Moriches Bay and enjoyed fishing, crabbing, and clamming. I’ve wanted to become a veterinarian since I was a young child. I remember writing a poem after my first dog, Smokey (a rescued shepherd mix I had a strong connection with), died. She was a sweet, patient soul and gave the best snuggles. Writing that poem was a heartfelt way to process my grief and keep her memories alive. The words became a bridge to the past, allowing me to hold onto the joy and love she brought into my life. 

I completed my undergraduate studies with a major in biology and a minor in chemistry at Indiana University of Pennsylvania and then moved on to Auburn University College of Veterinary Medicine for vet school. 

I have 24 years of experience in small animal medicine and surgery, and the best part about working in the veterinary field has always been making a difference in the lives of my patients and their loving families. Other than my experience in general practice, I am a platelet donor for the American Red Cross and a volunteer for World Vets, providing spay and neuter services for the local pets belonging to the indigenous people of Otavalo, Ecuador. These experiences have contributed to my passion for veterinary medicine and supporting pets in need. 

I have had many sweet pets over the years, including dogs, cats, ferrets, and parakeets. Losing a pet is one of the most difficult life events to go through. Ultimately what has given me the most peace is knowing that they passed without distress in a calm and serene way. 

In-home euthanasia for pets offers a more intimate and familiar setting for both the pet and their family. The pet is more comfortable in familiar surroundings and the experience is often less rushed, allowing for a peaceful and gentle farewell with loved ones providing comfort and support during the final moments. 

Outside of veterinary medicine, I enjoy spending time with my two children, dogs, and cats, and I love gardening, glamping, and traveling. 

#### About Dr. Mike Breuning

I grew up in Lambertville, New Jersey, a small town on the Delaware River across from New Hope, Pennsylvania. As an only child, I grew up thinking of my pets as siblings. Becoming a veterinarian became my career goal after volunteering with Americorps during my gap year between high school and college. I spent most of that year stationed in New Orleans, helping to rebuild after Hurricane Katrina. Although I found all the work fulfilling, caring for the animals who were displaced by the storm was by far the most meaningful to me. That was when I became certain that a life helping animals was my calling.

I completed a Bachelor of Science degree from Rutgers University in 2012 and graduated magna cum laude from Auburn University College of Veterinary Medicine in 2019. After graduating, I worked at a small animal practice in New Jersey, caring mostly for dogs and cats. I cherished the relationships I formed with my patients and their families and took pride in strengthening them through compassion and communication. I always strive to make my patients and their families as comfortable as possible, and I have found that this is often best achieved by treating pets where they are most comfortable: in their homes.

Having had more than 10 pets in my life, I have extensive experience caring for aging and sick pets. I have had pets euthanized at home and in veterinary clinics, and I fully understand the benefits of saying goodbye in the comfort of your own home, for both the pet and their family.

When I'm not working, I love spending time on our farm with my wife and our four-legged children: our cats Chipper, Larry, and Chuma; our Chiweenie Lady; our horses Willow, Ouija, and Gracie; our sheep Beatrice and Ana; and our alpacas Pete and Bootie. I am also an avid golfer, love to ski, and enjoy spending the warmer months with friends on the Delaware River.
