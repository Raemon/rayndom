I wanted to thank all at Lap of Love for the way they offer their services in such a compassionate manner. The Blackburns were greatly impressed with the care that was given them and their dog during this stressful time. They specifically wanted to shout out to Dr. Nellie Wilbers for the empathy that she displayed. As a DVM, I also appreciated that you were able to provide such a needed service for clients in distress in their homes. Thanks for what you do.
