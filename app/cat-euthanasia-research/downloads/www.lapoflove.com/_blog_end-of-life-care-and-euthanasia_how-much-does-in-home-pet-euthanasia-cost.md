You have options for end-of-life care for your dog or cat, including[in-home euthanasia](/blog/end-of-life-care-and-euthanasia/how-do-I-know-its-time-to-euthanize-pet). This option involves a licensed veterinarian visiting your home, allowing your pet to remain in a familiar environment surrounded by those who love them. 

Many pet owners prefer in-home euthanasia, but aren’t sure how costs compare to other options. So, how much does in-home euthanasia cost, and what’s included in the base price? Here, we walk pet owners through the typical cost of at-home pet euthanasia with Lap of Love, explain factors that can affect pricing, and outline the services included with each visit. 

## What is included in the in-home euthanasia cost?

In-home euthanasia costs include a package of services so that every aspect of the experience is covered. The cost of the package and its inclusions vary depending on your location. For example, the base price at Lap of Love in the [Chicagoland area](/find-a-vet/Illinois/Chicago/services) is $530, which includes: 

* A veterinarian’s time and travel costs

* Light sedation before euthanasia

* Euthanasia in a chosen location in your home

* Clay paw print impression keepsake

* Lock of fur in a memorial pouch

* Grief support booklet

* Pet loss support resources

You can determine the cost of in-home pet euthanasia in your area by finding a [Lap of Love ](/find-a-vet)veterinarian near you and then navigating to the pricing section of the website. Base package fees reflect the personalized nature of the service we provide and the time each veterinarian takes to provide compassionate care in a supportive environment. 

## Why does in-home euthanasia cost more than a clinic visit?

In-home pet euthanasia services typically cost more than a euthanasia procedure at a veterinary hospital. The key difference between these services is the time required. Mobile veterinarians must travel to your home to provide service, which takes time. They also must invest in maintenance and supplies for their vehicles.

The level of service provided by Lap of Love in-home euthanasia veterinarians is unmatched. They offer a personalized, compassionate service that alleviates stress for pets and their families. Because of this, many families believe that the extra comfort and time provided by an in-home visit are well worth the additional expense.

## What can affect the total in-home euthanasia cost?

The base price for euthanasia services is fixed; however, you may incur additional costs for specific services or add-ons. Factors that may affect the overall cost include:

* Time of day or week – Evening, weekend, holiday, or last-minute appointments may include a surcharge. For Lap of Love clients, this ranges from $100 to $200. 

* Location – Most mobile services operate within a defined radius. Appointments outside of this area may incur additional travel fees.

* Pet size and temperament – Large, aggressive, or exotic pets may require extra handling or sedation, which can increase the cost.

If you’re unsure what your final cost might be, most mobile veterinary teams are happy to provide a personalized estimate when you call or submit a request online. You can reach the Lap of Love support center directly by phone at 855-933-5683 or look up your zip code on the [website](/find-a-vet) and submit a short form. We also offer a live chat feature on the website.

## Aftercare options and cremation fees

In addition to the euthanasia service itself, you must decide [how to handle your pet’s remains.](/our-services/aftercare) Many pet owners choose private or communal cremation, each of which incurs an additional fee. When you choose cremation, the veterinary team will take care of this for you. If you select an alternative option, such as burial, you will need to coordinate the aftercare yourself.

Private and communal cremation costs depend on the size of your pet. During a private cremation, your pet is cremated individually, and you get their ashes back. Costs for private cremation depend on the local crematory’s prices. Ashes are returned to you or your family veterinarian within two weeks, depending on your preference.

During a communal cremation, pets are cremated alongside several others and their ashes scattered respectfully. You will not get ashes back with this option, and pricing varies by region and crematory. 

Always ask your local provider for a total estimate so you know exactly what to expect from your visit.

## Value beyond cost

While the cost of in-home euthanasia is often higher than that of traditional clinic euthanasia, many pet owners find that it [provides immeasurable value](/blog/end-of-life-care-and-euthanasia/the-6-benefits-of-in-home-euthanasia). In-home services allow pets to pass in a stress-free, familiar environment, surrounded by the people (and other pets) they love.

In-home euthanasia also facilitates a more inclusive, private, and customizable experience for the family. Families can choose to have as many or as few people present for emotional support and to say goodbye. The process is never rushed, and families can feel free to express emotions and honor their pet in ways they may feel uncomfortable doing in a clinic setting. 

Another difference between in-home euthanasia and in-clinic services is the [extensive support ](/our-services/pet-loss-support)provided by in-home providers like Lap of Love. Hospice veterinarians are trained to provide support during euthanasia and can refer pet owners to outside support groups or mental health professionals for further assistance. These added services can be a lifeline for grieving pet owners.

## Does pet insurance cover in-home euthanasia?

Since in-home euthanasia may cost more than in-clinic services, you might wonder if your pet insurance covers the cost. Some plans specify coverage for euthanasia and cremation, but coverage is not universal. Additionally, it’s unlikely that insurance will cover veterinarian travel fees or add-ons, like keepsakes and memorials. 

Review your policy details carefully before booking an in-home visit, paying particular attention to any specific exclusions that may apply. If the policy is unclear, you can file a claim after the appointment to determine your eligibility for reimbursement. 

Other payment methods can help cover the cost of in-home euthanasia. If you need to spread the cost over several months, consider a pet-specific credit card, such as CareCredit, or other payment plans offered by in-home service providers.

## Before you book

Here are a few tips to guide you if you are considering in-home euthanasia for your pet:

* Contact Lap of Love to inquire about service packages and costs, as well as any additional options.

* Confirm whether additional travel fees will be applied based on the location.

* Discuss aftercare options and preferences before the visit.

* Take advantage of the included support resources to [navigate grief ](/blog/pet-loss-support/coping-with-pet-loss-grief-in-home-euthanasia)after in-home euthanasia.

The cost of at-home pet euthanasia is only one factor in your decision of where and when to say goodbye to your pet. For many, the personalization, privacy, and comfort provided for pets and their families during in-home services is worth the additional cost.
