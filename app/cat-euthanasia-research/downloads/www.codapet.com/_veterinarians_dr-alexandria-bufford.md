Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

As a dedicated veterinarian with four years of experience, I am passionate about providing a peaceful transition for pets and their families during their most challenging times. Working in a small animal practice, I witnessed firsthand the stress and anxiety that pets and their owners often face in a clinic setting. This has fueled my commitment to offering compassionate end-of-life care that honors the bond between pets and their humans. I strive to create a supportive environment where families can navigate this difficult process with grace and understanding, ensuring their beloved companions receive the dignity they deserve.

> Dr. Bufford was kind, considerate, and caring during this difficult journey. She talked us through the process. I knew I would be emotional, and she handled it like a pro. I cannot say enough good things about her and this service. It’s a tough job and not a good circumstance, so having good people like Dr. Bufford is essential.

> Dr Bufford came to our home on Sunday afternoon. She showed compassion and kindness for not only our dog, Panzer but for my husband and I as well. I appreciated how she pet Panzer afterwards. Panzer had been in pain and the only place we could pet her was her head. I know I was second guessing our decision until she did that. She went over and above and we are very grateful.

> I recently had to make the heart-wrenching decision to euthanize my dogs, and I chose to use Codapet for their end-of-life care. The entire process was seamless, starting with an easy scheduling experience. I was able to communicate directly with the vet, Dr. Bufford, in the week leading up to the appointment, asking questions and providing information about my pets. When Dr. Bufford arrived, she immediately sat on the floor with my dogs to greet them, offering a calm and compassionate presence. She took the time to discuss their health and gently explained that, while they seemed okay for their age, their symptoms indicated they were likely experiencing quality of life issues. Her approach was so gentle that my dogs began to relax and even fall asleep as she assessed them. Throughout this emotional time, Dr. Bufford showed incredible empathy toward me and my family. Her kindness and professionalism made a difficult experience much more bearable. Even after the visit, she has continued to provide updates on the delivery of their ashes and keepsakes, which I truly appreciate. I wholeheartedly recommend Codapet for anyone in need of compassionate end-of-life services for their pets.
