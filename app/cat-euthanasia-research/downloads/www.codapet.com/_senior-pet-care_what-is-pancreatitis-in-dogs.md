# What is Pancreatitis in Dogs?

[Dr. Gary Hsia](/experts/dr-gary-hsia)

February 06, 2025

Pancreatitis in dogs can be life-threatening, but early detection and proper care make all the difference. Watch for signs like vomiting, lethargy, or bloating, and act fast—your pup’s health depends on it! A vet-approved, low-fat diet is key to prevention.

Pancreatitis is a common but severe gastrointestinal condition where the pancreas becomes inflamed. The pancreas is a small organ near the small intestines and is responsible for producing insulin (the hormone that regulates blood sugar) and for producing digestive enzymes that break down food in the intestines. Pancreatitis occurs when those digestive enzymes are released while still in the pancreas, and thus begins to damage the dog’s own pancreatic cells. In addition, because the pancreas is also located near the liver, stomach, and small intestines, we can also see damage to those organs.

## What Causes Pancreatitis in Dogs?

The exact cause of pancreatitis is unknown, however there are some risk factors associated with acute pancreatitis, primarily eating high-fat foods (bacon, sausage, fried foods, fat trimmings and other table scraps) and or getting into the garbage. Also, dogs with other preexisting diseases such as obesity, liver disease, hypothyroidism and diabetes can also be at higher risk in developing pancreatitis.

## Breeds Predisposed to Pancreatitis

It is unclear why pancreatitis affects certain breeds and genders more, but it seems to affect middle-aged female, smaller breed dogs such as:

  
• Miniature Schnauzers  
• Cocker Spaniels  
• Miniature poodles  
• Yorkshire Terriers  
• Daschunds  
• Cavalier King Charles Spaniel

## Common Clinical Signs and Symptoms

Acute pancreatitis symptoms in dogs are mostly gastrointestinal. Clinical signs can vary depending on severity, as some dogs with chronic pancreatitis may show milder signs during a flare up. However in general, pancreatitis can be a very serious and even fatal condition. It is recommended to consult your veterinarian if you see these clinical signs:

  
• Anorexia  
• Lethargy/ depression  
• Vomiting  
• Diarrhea  
• Fever  
• Painful, tense abdomen often with a hunched back  
• Bloated abdomen  
• Dehydration secondary to vomiting and diarrhea

## Diagnosing Pancreatitis in Dogs

Pancreatitis is primarily diagnosed through routine blood tests, ultrasound and owner observation of the dog's dietary history and clinical signs. Your veterinarian may recommend baseline blood work and a more specialized test called a specific pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity test (SpecPL). This test measures the amount of the pancreatic enzyme lipase that is in the blood. This enzyme is only produced in the pancreas, so when found in high levels in the blood, it indicates that the pancreas is damaged or inflamed, thus allowing the lipase enzyme to “leak out” and be found in the blood.

## Treatment for Pancreatitis in Dogs

In general, acute pancreatitis is more severe than chronic pancreatitis. Depending on the severity, acute pancreatitis often requires hospitalization to stabilize their condition. Treatment of pancreatitis has traditionally been supportive care. However, there is a newer medication called Panoquell-CA1, that received conditional approval in late 2022 from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This medication reduces white blood cells from moving out of the blood stream and into the pancreatic tissue, thus decreasing the inflammation of the pancreas. Panoquell-CA1 is commonly administered in conjunction with traditional supportive care treatments such as fluid therapy, pain medication, anti nausea medication, antibiotics, nutritional therapy and additional supportive care.

  
Recovery time is highly dependent on the severity of the pancreatitis. For milder cases, your dog likely will need to be in the hospital anywhere from 2 to 4 days, and for more severe cases sometimes 5-7 days. After your dog leaves the hospital you can expect them to have fully recovered after 1 to 2 weeks, however your dog may require a few follow-up visits to monitor their pancreatic function. A permanent change in diet as well as lifestyle adjustments may be recommended.

  
In more mild cases of pancreatitis can often be managed with outpatient treatment with subcutaneous fluids, pain management, antibiotics and anti nausea medication.

  
Dogs with chronic pancreatitis may not need hospitalization and can sometimes be treated as outpatient during flare ups. Your veterinarian may recommend switching your dog to a lower fat diet permanently, as high protein and high-fat diets can contribute to pancreatitis flare ups.

## Best Diet for Pancreatitis

In many cases, your veterinarian may recommend withholding food completely for a short period of time. When your veterinarian says it's okay to reintroduce meals, your dog should eat low-fat, easily digestible foods in small portions. Some common foods include:

  
• Rice/ pasta  
• Low fat plain yogurt  
•**** Low fat cottage cheese  
• Unseasoned, boiled chicken or lean turkey  
• Prescription diets such as Hill’s I/D

  
In general, it is better to feed smaller portions and make sure your dog does not vomit up their food, before introducing larger portions.

## Management of Chronic Pancreatitis in Dogs

With proper treatment, most dogs will make a full recovery with acute pancreatitis, however, chronic pancreatitis can be difficult and frustrating to control. Since the cause of the pancreatitis is not always known, it can be difficult to enact lasting preventative measures. Also, once a patient has had an episode of pancreatitis, they are more susceptible to repeat episodes. Your veterinarian may recommend further diagnostic testing to determine if there may be an underlying condition such as diabetes or obesity that is predisposing your dog to pancreatitis. Pancreatitis cannot always be prevented. However, in general avoiding high-fat diets like treats or table scraps, maintaining a lean and healthy body weight and being diligent in observing for signs of a flare-up can decrease risks of pancreatitis flare ups.

## Summary

Pancreatitis can be an acute or chronic condition. While the underlying causes are not fully known, owners can help prevent this condition by not feeding high-fat foods, and maintaining a healthy body weight for your dog. Because of the potential severity of pancreatitis, it is recommended you seek immediate veterinary care if you recognize the common symptoms of pancreatitis. This will greatly improve your dog's chances of a good prognosis.
