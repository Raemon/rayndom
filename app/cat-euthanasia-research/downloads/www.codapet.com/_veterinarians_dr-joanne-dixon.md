Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I see veterinary medicine as a profession of service, service to the animals in need of care and service to their owners who share and mutually celebrate the human animal bond. Every animal whom I care for teaches me something and helps me be a better veterinarian and a better person. In-home euthanasia is a gift that we can give our pets. We can provide solace for them and our families by letting them pass on in a place they know surrounded by those they love. In-home euthanasia allows us to be able to advocate for our pets and make the choice for how we want to say goodbye.

## What pet parents are saying

> We lost our 7 yr old German Pinscher to cancer a few weeks ago. Dr. Dixon came to our home to manage his euthanasia. Her help was so professional and compassionate. She arrived on time, explained what to expect, and talked calmly through the passing. We chose euthanasia at home out of love and respect for a dear member of our family. It was absolutely brutal emotionally. I would never recommend this to anyone, but I will absolutely euthanize every one of our pets at home if at all possible. If you are reading this, I'm so sorry for your loss. If you are reading this, your pet is so lucky to have had you in their life.

> Our dog Axl had a brain tumor that caused a sudden onset of seizures. We did everything we could to space the seizures out, but they got worse two days before Christmas. He had 6 in a 12 hour period, and he almost didn't come out of the last one. It was 3am, and we new it was time to make the hardest decision. It was important that he was euthanized at home where he was comfortable, but every vet that offered home euthanasia was closed for the holiday. That's when we found Coda Pet and Dr. Dixon. She came the next morning, and helped us all get through one of the hardest days of our lives. She was everything Axl needed in his last moments, and we'll be forever grateful to her for her services.

> We got the heartbreaking news on a Saturday afternoon that our dog had complications following surgery and would not survive the weekend. In home pet euthanasia is very important to us, as it allows them to cross over in a place they know and are comfortable, and we were concerned we wouldn’t be able to find a vet to come to our home in time. We were able to book an appointment online with Dr. Dixon to come to our house that weekend, and she was flexible with timing when we realized that we needed her services even earlier than planned. She had a calming and compassionate presence and explained the process so we were prepared. Our dog was able to pass away peacefully in our back yard, surrounded by her family. Saying good-bye to our sweet girl was incredibly difficult, but being able to have her pass calmly in her favorite place was comforting. Thank you to Dr. Dixon and Codapet for being there when we needed you.

> Dr. Dixon is my animal hero! The way she came on very short notice to help my Rosie over the Bridge was such an enormous relief to me. The peaceful passing of my dog gave me the chance to hold that memory as a positive one in my heart The added service of cremation and the return of her ashes was another way to make a difficult time a bit easier. The fact that Dr. Dixon comes from La Pine to all over Bend shows how generous and caring she is. Lyn McClure

> Dr. Dixon provided such empathetic and knowledgeable care on a very difficult day. She took care of everything and we never doubted Frankie was loved and cared for by her from the moment she entered our home to the moment she returned his ashes. Could not more highly recommend Dr. Dixon! We will utilize her services as long as we live in Central Oregon.

> I seldom leave reviews but my experience with Dr. Dixon deserves recognition. Her care, compassion and communication was as good as I could ever hope for in that painful time of losing a beloved. Missy is the 4th Dog I have had to make that painful decision with and the transition was made easier with Dr. Dixon's Love and Care. thank you Tim

> Dr. Dixon was absolutely incredible. She made an extremely difficult and emotional process a little easier with her calm demeanor and truly caring treatment of our big old boy. I had a lot of anxiety leading up to our appointment but as soon as she came in and met our fur family, I was quickly put at ease. She gave us plenty of space and provided us all the time we needed to say our final goodbye. For something so difficult, we could not have asked for more from a veterinarian.

> "I wasn't aware of this at home service and I wish my primary Vet had suggested it as an option. Thank God a friend suggested this. My dog was able to pass in his own home environment with a ton of love around him. JoAnne was professional and caring and walked us through step by step. This is the only route we will take from now on. I highly recommend this option."

She let us know everything she was doing and what to expect. But, her compassion was above and beyond anything I have experienced before. Thank you so much for helping us through this difficult time.

> She was definitely professional and efficient on the day of. However, when delivering the ashes she left them on our front porch without even ringing the bell. We were home luckily (and had told her we would be) but have had package thefts before and it left kind of a bad taste in our mouth. The paw print was also poorly done with a long smear on one of the toes.
