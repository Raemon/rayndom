# Comprehensive Guide to Understanding Cancer in Dogs

[Dr. Karen Whala](/experts/dr-karen-whala)

September 06, 2024

Cancer in dogs can be a daunting diagnosis for any pet owner. Early detection and effective treatment are crucial for managing this challenging condition. Our comprehensive guide provides essential information on recognizing the symptoms of cancer in dogs, understanding diagnostic options, and exploring treatment and supportive care strategies. Whether you're facing a recent diagnosis or seeking to learn more about canine cancer, this blog offers valuable insights to help you navigate your pet's journey with knowledge and compassion.

## **What is Cancer?**

Cancer is a term used to describe a multitude of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. At the cellular level, these cells bypass the normal checks and balances that regulate cellular replication and function. In dogs, these uncharacteristic cells can cluster to form masses, known as tumors, invade nearby tissues, and metastasize to other parts of the body through the bloodstream and lymphatic system.

As a complex array of conditions, cancer can potentially affect any part of a dog's anatomy, compromising vital functions and leading to a range of health issues. It's vital for pet owners to recognize that cancer encompasses not just a single entity, but an extensive group of diseases, each with varying profiles and behaviors. Understanding this complexity is key to recognizing signs early and seeking appropriate care for canine companions.

## **How Common is Cancer in Dogs?**

Cancer is, regrettably, not an uncommon health issue in dogs, particularly as they advance in years. Statistics show that roughly 50% of dogs over the age of 10 will develop some form of cancer, positioning it as a leading cause of mortality among older canines. It's critical to recognize that cancer doesn't discriminate by age alone, and it can affect younger dogs as well. Moreover, certain breeds are predisposed to particular cancers due to genetic factors. For pet owners, being aware of the [signs of cancer](https://www.codapet.com/senior-pet-care/recognizing-the-signs-of-dog-cancer), coupled with consistent veterinary care, is key to early identification and intervention, which can significantly affect outcomes.

## **Symptoms of Cancer in Dogs**

Detecting cancer in dogs early can make a significant difference in their quality of life and treatment options. Various symptoms may indicate the presence of cancer, and while these may also be related to other health issues, it is always best to approach any changes in your dog’s health with caution and care.

Common symptoms that might point to cancer include:

  * **Persistent Abnormal Swellings:** Lumps that continue to grow can be a sign of tumors. Not all lumps are malignant, but they should be evaluated by a veterinarian.
  * **Sores That Do Not Heal:** These may be an indication of infection or disease, including cancer, especially if they're unresponsive to usual treatments.
  * **Weight Loss:** Even if your dog is eating well, unexplained weight loss could be a symptom of cancer.
  * **Loss of Appetite or Difficulty Eating:** A noticeable disinterest in food or trouble swallowing could signal oral tumors or other conditions.
  * **Bleeding or Discharge From Any Body Opening:** Unusual bleeding or discharge might be a sign of internal tumors.
  * **Offensive Odor:** An unexpected foul smell from your dog could be associated with tumors among other conditions.
  * **Difficulty Breathing, Urinating, or Defecating:** These are critical functions, and any persistent trouble could suggest a serious underlying health issue, including cancer.
  * **Persistent Lameness or Stiffness:** Although sometimes a sign of arthritis or other joint diseases, any rigidity that doesn’t resolve with rest should be medically reviewed.
  * **Visible Pain and Discomfort:** Dogs hiding or exhibiting signs of distress without a clear reason could be experiencing pain related to cancer.



While these symptoms may be alarming, they are not a definite indication of cancer. Nevertheless, they warrant a thorough veterinary evaluation to diagnose the cause and establish appropriate care. Your commitment to monitoring your pet’s health is a testament to the strong bond you share. Should you observe any of these symptoms, we encourage reaching out to your vet promptly – and remember, CodaPet is here to provide support and guidance when or if your pet’s quality of life is poor and euthanasia becomes a good option for your beloved companion.

## **Risk Factors for Cancer in Dogs**

Several factors can elevate the likelihood of a dog developing cancer. As in humans, age plays a critical role; the risk escalates as dogs grow older. Genetics also have a significant sway, with certain breeds like Golden Retrievers and Boxers being inherently more susceptible to certain types of cancer.

To understand the breadth of risk factors, one must consider the dog's environment. As in people, carcinogens—like secondhand smoke, specific pesticides, and various forms of radiation—pose increased risks. Moreover, lifestyle elements such as diet and exercise habits contribute to the overall picture of a dog's cancer risk. Nonetheless, it's essential to recognize that while these factors may inform risk, they don't guarantee the development of cancer. Similarly, there are instances of dogs with no discernible risk factors who do, unfortunately, develop the disease. It is the interplay of multiple variables, and not a single determinant, that influences a dog's cancer risk.

## **Most Common Types of Cancer in Dogs**

### Malignant Lymphoma

Malignant lymphoma is a form of cancer that predominantly affects the lymphocytes, which are a vital part of the immune system. Specifically, this type of cancer targets the lymphoid tissues, which are distributed throughout the body in lymph nodes, spleen, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and sometimes the skin. The pervasive nature of these tissues means that lymphoma can arise almost anywhere, leading to a wide range of possible symptoms that may affect different parts of your pet's body.

When considering treatment options for malignant lymphoma in dogs, a multi-faceted approach is often employed, integrating chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and occasionally surgery. Each treatment plan is tailored to the individual dog's needs, aiming to achieve remission and maintain the highest possible quality of life. The thoughtful application of these treatments can offer precious additional time and comfort to your beloved companion.

### Skin Tumors

The most common type of skin ‘tumors’ are actually not malignant and include fatty tumors or skin tags. But like benign tumors, malignant skin tumors such as Mast Cell Tumors and Hemangiomas can occur anywhere on the body and vary greatly in terms of their appearance, growth rate, and malignancy. Some of the most common types of malignant skin tumors in dogs include mast cell tumors, melanoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. Treatment for skin tumors typically involves surgical removal of the tumor. In some cases, additional treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy may also be recommended. It's important to check your dog's skin regularly for any signs of lumps, bumps, or skin changes and to take your dog to the veterinarian if you notice anything unusual.

### Bone Cancer

Bone cancer, or osteosarcoma, is a particularly aggressive type of cancer that is common in larger breed dogs. It typically affects the long bones in the legs but can also occur less frequently in the bones of the spine, skull, or ribcage. Symptoms often include lameness, swelling, and pain in the affected area, and these signs can appear suddenly or develop slowly over time.

Common treatments for bone cancer in dogs involve a multipronged approach. Surgery to remove the affected bone is often the first step, aiming to eradicate the primary tumor and prevent further growth. Chemotherapy follows to address any remaining cancer cells, helping to reduce the risk of metastases or recurrence. Radiation therapy may not be curative but is frequently used to manage pain and improve quality of life for dogs with bone cancer.

### Breast Cancer

Breast cancer in dogs, also recognized as mammary gland tumors, is a condition that predominantly affects female canines. While it can manifest in both benign and malignant forms, the disease requires prompt intervention to prevent further health complications. These tumors are particularly prevalent in unspayed females or those that were spayed at an older age. Early detection is key and can be signaled by lumps or swellings around the mammary areas, possible ulcerations, discharge, or indications of discomfort in the pet.

To confront this disease, the primary course of action usually includes surgical removal of the tumor-laden mammary glands. Based on the individual case and cancer's severity, supplementary treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy could be warranted. Moreover, prophylactic measures like spaying can play a crucial role in minimizing the risk; doing so before a dog's first heat cycle offers the most significant protective effect against the development of breast cancer. It is vital for pet owners to maintain regular veterinary check-ups to ensure any signs of mammary tumors are caught and treated early.

## **Diagnosis of Cancer in Dogs**

### History

One of the most important aspects of obtaining a diagnosis for a veterinarian is understanding the behavior of the tumor prior to examination. As a pet owner your recollection of when, where and how long the tumor has developed and what behavior changes you have noticed can help tremendously. The questions that really help your veterinarian include:

  * When did you first notice a difference in your pet’s behavior?
  * If it’s a skin tumor, when did you first notice it? How fast has it grown? Does your pet seem bothered by it? Does it change sizes rapidly? This could indicate a Mast Cell tumor.
  * Any other or unusual signs that your pet may be exhibiting such as changes in appetite, thirst, bathroom habits or activity level?
  * Does your pet have any coughing, vomiting, diarrhea or seizures?



Any changes you observe, whether subtle or not, may help your veterinarian in narrowing down a list of possible causes.

### Physical Examination

Besides the pet owner’s recollection of the tumor’s behavior and history, a physical examination conducted by a veterinarian is a critical step when addressing concerns about cancer or general health in our beloved canine companions. This type of assessment is designed to evaluate the dog's overall health and detect any unusual signs that might warrant further investigation. Here's what this process typically involves:

  * **Observation:** The vet will start by observing the dog's behavior, gait, and overall appearance.
  * **Palpation:** By gently feeling the dog's body, the vet can discover lumps, masses, or swollen lymph nodes that could indicate the presence of cancer.
  * **Auscultation:** Using a stethoscope, the vet listens to the dog's heart and lung sounds.
  * **Weight and Body Condition:** Changes in weight, either gain or loss, can be a sign of cancer or other systemic health issues.
  * **Skin and Coat Inspection:** Sometimes, external tumors or skin lesions are visible and can be early indicators of underlying issues.



The importance of these regular physical check-ups cannot be overstated. Dogs are skilled at hiding discomfort, and without routine examinations, some conditions, including cancer, can progress unnoticed until they reach a critical stage. Early detection through these exams is vital for the prompt initiation of treatment and can significantly impact prognosis and overall outcomes for our pets.

### Blood Tests

Blood tests play a significant role in the initial assessment of a dog's health when cancer is suspected. By analyzing factors like blood cell counts, including both white and red blood cells, these tests can point to signs of malignancy or other diseases. For instance, an elevated white blood cell count might indicate inflammation or infection, both of which can be associated with cancer. Additionally, blood tests can evaluate the function of vital organs such as the liver and kidneys, where abnormalities may be a secondary effect of cancer growth.

Blood chemistry panels are also essential, revealing levels of various enzymes and proteins. Some of these may be tumor markers, substances produced by cancer cells or by the body in response to cancer. While these indicators can hint at the presence of cancer, there are considerable limitations to blood tests as a standalone diagnostic tool. They do not confirm cancer conclusively nor pinpoint its exact location. For a definitive diagnosis, further investigation with advanced imaging techniques or tissue biopsies is indispensable. It is crucial for pet owners to understand that a comprehensive approach is necessary for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning.

### Biopsy

A biopsy is an essential diagnostic tool that involves collecting a sample of tissue or cells from a dog's body to be examined under a microscope. This procedure is crucial for accurately diagnosing cancer, as it can help identify the specific type and grade of the disease. This information is vital in crafting a targeted treatment plan. Depending on the suspected cancer's nature and location, veterinarians may opt for different biopsy methods, such as needle, punch, or surgical biopsies. Despite its high diagnostic value, it's important to acknowledge that biopsies carry a small risk of complications like infection or bleeding, particularly in cases where the affected area is difficult to access.

### Imaging Studies

As in people, imaging studies, including X-rays, ultrasounds, CT scans, and MRI scans, are invaluable tools in the diagnosis of cancer in dogs. Each type of imaging study serves a unique purpose and provides different forms of insight into your dog's condition.

  * **X-rays:** This common form of imaging is especially useful for examining the skeletal system. It can detect bone cancer or reveal if cancer has metastasized to the lungs.
  * **Ultrasounds:** An ultrasound is particularly adept at providing detailed images of soft tissue structures within the abdomen and chest, pinpointing tumors in the liver or spleen.
  * **CT scans:** Computed tomography (CT) scans offer a more comprehensive and precise image than standard X-rays, showing cross-sectional views of the body which can help locate tumors and determine if surgical intervention is possible.
  * **MRI scans:** Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is highly sophisticated and can distinguish between healthy tissue and tumors, especially useful for brain or spinal cord cancers.



These imaging tests not only help in identifying and localizing tumors but also in staging the cancer—assessing how advanced it is and whether it has spread (metastasized) to other parts of the body. While typically non-invasive, it's important to note that some imaging studies require sedation or anesthesia to keep your pet still, ensuring the clearest possible images for accurate diagnosis.

## **Treatment Options for Dogs with Cancer**

### Surgery

Surgery is often the first-line treatment for many types of cancer in dogs, especially if the cancer is localized and has not spread to other parts of the body. The goal of surgery is to remove the entire tumor, along with a margin of healthy tissue, to ensure that no cancer cells are left behind. In some cases, surgery may be combined with other treatments, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy, to increase the chances of success.

The decision to proceed with surgery takes into account various factors, such as the dog's overall health, age, and the progression of cancer. It should also consider the financial, emotional and physical burden of undertaking a major surgery. When a surgical option is on the table, your veterinarian should thoroughly discuss with you whether your pet is a good candidate for surgery and what you can expect during the recovery period.

Recovery and post-operative care are just as important as the surgery itself. After the procedure, your pet will need a calm and comfortable space to recuperate. Pain management is a priority; our veterinarians will prescribe appropriate pain relief medications to ensure your pet's comfort. Close monitoring of the surgical site for signs of infection or delayed healing is essential. You will also receive detailed guidance on how to care for your dog during this time, including dietary recommendations and any restrictions on activity.

Regular follow-up appointments are necessary to monitor your pet's recovery and to check for any signs of cancer recurrence.

### Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy is a form of treatment that comprises using specific drugs designed to target and eradicate cancer cells or halt their proliferation. While it's most commonly associated with human cancer therapy, chemotherapy is also a viable option for treating dogs with cancer, particularly when the disease has metastasized or is inoperable. The administration of chemotherapy in dogs may differ from humans, focusing on maintaining a quality of life by using lower dosages, which reduces the likelihood of severe side effects. Due to the difference in approach, dogs often experience milder side effects as compared to their human counterparts. These can include mild nausea, decreased appetite, and temporary lethargy. In some cases, certain drugs may lead to more pronounced side effects such as bone marrow suppression, which necessitates close monitoring by a veterinarian.

It's essential to understand that each dog's reaction to chemotherapy can vary significantly. The veterinarian overseeing the treatment will tailor the chemotherapy protocol to the individual needs of the dog, factoring in the type of cancer, the dog's overall health, and other considerations unique to each case. In addition, vets will work closely with pet owners to manage any adverse effects and to ensure that their dog continues to enjoy a good quality of life during treatment. Providing comfort and optimizing the welfare of a pet undergoing chemotherapy is paramount.

### Radiation Therapy

Radiation therapy is a treatment that uses high-energy rays or particles to kill cancer cells or slow their growth. It is often used for cancers that cannot be completely removed with surgery, or for cancers located in areas where surgery is not possible like commonly on the face or limb. During radiation therapy, the radiation is carefully aimed to target the cancer while minimizing exposure to the surrounding healthy tissue. The treatment is typically given in multiple sessions over several weeks. Side effects of radiation therapy can include skin irritation, hair loss in the treated area, and fatigue, but these are usually temporary and can be managed with medications and supportive care.

### Immunotherapy

Immunotherapy represents a novel approach in the battle against canine cancer, harnessing the power of the body's own immune system to identify and combat malignant cells. This modality is typically available to veterinary oncologists only and can encompass various treatments, such as cancer vaccines, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and monoclonal antibodies, each designed to disrupt the growth and spread of cancer in unique ways. While Immunotherapy can stand alone as a treatment, it frequently complements traditional methods like surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation as part of a comprehensive, multimodal regimen. Veterinary oncologists may lean towards immunotherapy when confronting cancers unresponsive to conventional treatments, or when dealing with specific cancer types with a historical susceptibility to immune-based strategies. The potential side effects of immunotherapy are wide-ranging and closely linked to the particular immunotherapeutic avenue undertaken, emphasizing the need for a tailored approach to each individual case.

## **Living with a Dog with Cancer**

### Pain Management and Quality of Life

As your companion faces the challenge of cancer, maintaining their comfort becomes paramount. At CodaPet, we understand that effective pain management is closely linked to a dog's quality of life. It's more than administering medication; it's about creating an environment where your pet can still enjoy their favorite activities and rest peacefully without discomfort.

Pain management encompasses a variety of strategies tailored to each dog's situation. These strategies might include pharmaceuticals like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids, and other pain-relieving medications, each with their own potential benefits and side effects. Care for pets with cancer goes beyond simply medications. Alternative methods such as physiotherapy, acupuncture, and even changes in diet or the addition of supplements might offer additional relief, enhancing your dog’s well-being.

[Monitoring your dog's quality of life](https://www.codapet.com/quality-of-life-scale) is pivotal. It is recommended to pay attention to changes in appetite, energy levels, and general demeanor. If you notice your dog becoming more reclusive, showing decreased interest in play, or exhibiting changes in their sleeping patterns, these may be signs that their pain needs to be reassessed and managed more effectively. Working closely with veterinarians who understand the nuances of pet comfort and behavior will ensure your dog's needs are met with the sensitivity they deserve.

Remember, no one knows your dog better than you do. Your observations are vital in adjusting their pain management plan and ensuring their days are filled with as much joy as possible. The journey with cancer is a difficult one, but with compassionate care centered on pain management and quality of life, we can help your dog live their remaining time with dignity and love.

## **Nutrition for Dogs with Cancer**

Proper nutrition is especially important for dogs with cancer. A balanced diet can help support your dog's immune system, maintain body weight and muscle mass, and improve tolerance to cancer treatments. Dogs with cancer often have different nutritional needs compared to healthy dogs. For example, they may need more protein or calories, or they may benefit from certain supplements. A veterinarian or a veterinary nutritionist can provide guidance on the best diet for your dog's specific needs. It's also important to monitor your dog's eating habits and body weight, and to address any feeding problems, such as loss of appetite or difficulty eating, as soon as they arise.

### Exercise and Physical Activity

Regular exercise and physical activity can play a significant role in supporting the health and wellbeing of a dog dealing with cancer. Keeping your beloved pet active helps maintain muscle strength, supports a healthy weight, and may contribute to an improved mood and behavior despite their illness. Moreover, some studies suggest that moderate physical activity might even slow down the progression of certain cancers in dogs.

Tailoring your dog's exercise regimen is vital and should take into account their general health, the type of cancer they are diagnosed with, its stage, and the ongoing treatments. Since each dog's situation is unique, it is essential to consult with your veterinarian or a veterinary oncologist to map out an exercise plan that suits your dog's specific needs.

Monitoring your furry companion during exercise is important; be attuned to their energy levels and any signs of discomfort. It may be necessary to adjust their activity level based on the way they respond to the exercise, as their condition and ability may fluctuate throughout their treatment journey.

### Emotional Support for Dogs and Owners

A cancer diagnosis in a dog can bring a torrent of emotions for both the pet and the owner. During this tumultuous period, it's paramount to provide emotional stability to your canine companion. They may intuitively pick up on any distress or unease you display, which could aggravate their condition. To support your dog emotionally, engage in comforting activities, strive to uphold a consistent daily pattern, and envelop them in an aura of affection and solace. These gestures can markedly lighten the burden of their illness and the accompanying therapies.

Simultaneously, pet owners mustn't neglect their emotional wellness. Building a support system is crucial—reach out to loved ones, connect with a community group dedicated to pet cancer, or consult with a mental health expert. Securing emotional assistance is a strength, not a weakness, especially when navigating the choppy waters of a pet's cancer journey.

## **Prevention of Cancer in Dogs**

### Regular Check-ups and Early Detection

Regular veterinary check-ups are crucial for early detection of cancer in dogs. These check-ups often include a thorough physical examination, during which the veterinarian will check for any signs of cancer such as lumps or changes in body weight or behavior. They may also include diagnostic tests, such as blood tests or imaging studies, to help detect any abnormalities that may suggest cancer. Early detection of cancer can greatly improve the prognosis, as many forms of cancer are more treatable when they are found early. Regular check-ups are especially important for older dogs and breeds that are predisposed to certain types of cancer.

### Healthy Diet and Lifestyle

A healthy diet and lifestyle can play a crucial role in cancer prevention in dogs. A balanced diet that is rich in high-quality protein, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can provide your dog with the nutrients they need to support their immune system and maintain a healthy body weight. Regular exercise can also help keep your dog fit and healthy, and may even help reduce the risk of certain types of cancer. Avoiding exposure to known carcinogens, such as secondhand smoke and certain pesticides, can also help reduce your dog's risk of cancer. Remember, every dog is unique, and their dietary and lifestyle needs may vary based on their age, breed, and overall health. Consult with a veterinarian for personalized advice.

### Spaying and Neutering

Spaying and neutering are surgical procedures that prevent dogs from reproducing. In addition to preventing unwanted litters, spaying and neutering can also significantly reduce the risk of certain types of cancer, including breast cancer and testicular cancer. The timing of spaying or neutering can have an impact on its cancer prevention benefits. For example, spaying a female dog before her first heat cycle can significantly reduce her risk of developing breast cancer later in life. However, the optimal timing for spaying or neutering can depend on a variety of factors, including the dog's breed, size, and individual health. Consulting with a veterinarian can help you make an informed decision.

### Avoid Exposure to Carcinogens

Carcinogens are substances that can cause cancer, and like people, dogs can be exposed to these in various ways. Common carcinogens that dogs may be exposed to include secondhand smoke, certain pesticides and herbicides, and certain chemicals and toxins in the environment. Reducing your dog's exposure to these carcinogens can help lower their risk of developing cancer. This can include not smoking around your dog, using pet-safe products in your garden and home, and keeping your dog away from areas that may be contaminated with carcinogens. It's also a good idea to provide your dog with fresh, clean water and a balanced diet, as certain carcinogens can be found in food and water.

## **A Positive Outlook**

### Advancements in Canine Cancer Research

There have been significant advancements in canine cancer research in recent years, leading to better diagnostic tools, more effective treatments, and improved understanding of the disease. For example, researchers have made progress in understanding the genetic basis of certain types of cancer, leading to the development of new targeted therapies. Advances in imaging technology have also improved the ability to diagnose cancer and monitor its progression. These advancements have the potential to greatly improve the prognosis and quality of life for dogs with cancer.

### Success Stories and Survival Rates

Thanks to advancements in veterinary medicine, many dogs with cancer are living longer, healthier lives. Survival rates for dogs with cancer have improved significantly over the past few decades. Many dogs with cancer are able to maintain a good quality of life during treatment, and some can even be cured.
