Get help navigating end of life care and euthanasia decisions in dogs with kidney disease. Learn what symptoms to watch for that may indicate your dog is in pain and when to let them

## **Key Takeaways**

  * Kidney disease in dogs is a progressive condition where the kidneys lose their ability to filter waste and maintain fluid balance.
  * Common symptoms include increased thirst, frequent urination, weight loss, vomiting, lethargy, and loss of appetite.
  * Kidney disease can be caused by aging, infections, toxins, genetics, underlying health conditions, or chronic dehydration.



Kidney disease is a progressive and often irreversible condition that affects many dogs, gradually diminishing their quality of life. While early detection and proper management can help extend their time, there comes a point when treatment is no longer enough to keep them comfortable. Recognizing when your beloved companion is suffering and making the compassionate choice to say goodbye at home can be one of the most difficult yet loving decisions a pet owner faces. In this article, we’ll explore the stages of kidney disease, its symptoms, and when humane euthanasia may be the kindest option for your dog.

## **Understanding Chronic Kidney Disease in Dogs**

The kidneys are amazing little organs that remove toxins from the body. Blood is filtered through the kidneys, and toxins are removed and excreted in urine. The kidneys also maintain vital electrolyte balance, regulate blood pressure, produce urine, balance water in the body, signal the bone marrow to produce new red blood cells, and control calcium and phosphorus levels. ​‍ ​‍ ‌

As you can see, it is a big job, and the kidneys play a large part in keeping the body in balance. Luckily, the kidneys are tough and have a large reserve; therefore, they can withstand minor insults throughout a dog’s life while still maintaining homeostasis (biological stability). ​‍ ​‍ ‌

## **What Causes Kidney Disease in Dogs**

Kidney disease in dogs can be caused by aging-related degeneration, where the kidneys gradually lose function over time. Other common causes include infections, toxins (such as antifreeze or certain medications), and underlying conditions like high blood pressure or diabetes. Some dogs are also born with congenital kidney defects, making them more susceptible to kidney failure at a young age.

When the kidneys are severely damaged, they begin to lose function, and the body's homeostasis is disrupted. Toxins start to build up, and the systems that are so delicately managed go off the rails. Insults to the kidney can come on suddenly (acutely) or they can happen over a long period (chronically). Acute disease occurs when there is a direct incident that causes major damage to the kidneys. ​‍ ​‍ ‌

Your dog may become very sick, very fast. This requires immediate and swift action as treatment is necessary and can improve prognosis. Chronic kidney disease sneaks up on you slowly, and you may not notice until your veterinarian identifies changes in blood tests. ​‍ ​‍ ‌

### **Early Stages of Kidney Disease in Dogs**

Dog kidney disease is typically classified into four stages, based on the severity of kidney function loss. The first two stages are defined by:

  * **Stage 1** : Kidney function is mildly impaired, and there may be no visible symptoms. Blood tests may show slightly elevated kidney values, but the dog usually remains healthy and active.
  * **Stage 2** : Kidney function continues to decline, and mild symptoms, such as increased thirst, urination, and slight lethargy, may appear. Kidney values in blood tests are more noticeably elevated, and early intervention is crucial in slowing the progression.



Early-stage kidney disease can develop gradually, often becoming noticeable in middle-aged to senior dogs (typically around 7+ years old). Pet owners may observe subtle behavioral changes, such as their dog drinking more water or urinating indoors unexpectedly. While these symptoms may not seem alarming at first, they indicate the kidneys are struggling, and without intervention, the disease will progress.

### **Later Stages of Kidney Disease in Dogs**

As kidney disease progresses, stages 3 and 4 are marked by more severe symptoms and a significant decline in kidney function. They are defined by:

  * **Stage 3** : Kidney function is severely impaired, and noticeable symptoms such as significant weight loss, vomiting, and lethargy become more apparent. Blood tests show markedly elevated kidney values, and the dog may require more frequent veterinary care to manage the disease.
  * **Stage 4** : Kidney failure is end-stage, and symptoms intensify, including extreme lethargy, dehydration, and loss of appetite. At this stage, the dog’s kidneys are no longer able to function effectively, and euthanasia may be considered if quality of life deteriorates significantly.



In the later stages, kidney disease progresses rapidly, and pet owners may notice their dog’s condition worsening quickly. Severe symptoms will impact daily life, and the focus shifts from treatment to managing comfort, ensuring the dog’s remaining time is as comfortable as possible.

#### **What Is Congenital Kidney Disease in Dogs?**

Congenital kidney disease in dogs is a condition characterized by kidney abnormalities present from birth, often due to genetic factors. Unlike the gradual development seen in age-related kidney disease, congenital kidney disease typically manifests earlier in life, often in puppies or young adult dogs. This form of kidney disease can progress through the stages similarly to acquired kidney disease. It may move more rapidly through stages 1 and 2, depending on the severity of the defect. Dogs with congenital kidney disease may reach stage 3 or 4 more quickly, often requiring earlier intervention to manage symptoms and slow the progression.

## **Treating Dog Kidney Failure**

Treatment depends on the severity of chronic kidney disease and the stage of the condition. In many cases, intravenous fluids are administered to help flush toxins from the kidneys. Other treatments may include anti-nausea medications, blood pressure medication, and appetite stimulants if the dog is not eating well. The veterinarian will tailor the approach based on the individual dog's needs.

### **How To Comfort a Dog With Kidney Failure**

In addition to following your veterinarian’s treatment plan, you can also try to keep your dog as comfortable as possible while at home. Managing the conditions at home that may cause your dog stress will help his overall wellbeing. ​‍ ​‍ ‌

  * Make sure they have access to plenty of fresh water and allow access to appropriate bathroom areas. Potty pads or diapers may be utilized. You can also use waterproof coverings over bedding to make clean-up easier ​‍ ​‍ ‌
  * Appetite stimulants may be necessary, and this is where creative menus can be utilized. If you notice lip smacking or drooling, your dog may be experiencing nausea, and medications may help stimulate their appetite. ​‍ ​‍ ‌
  * Pressure sores on elbows and hips can occur if your dog is lying down a great deal. Make sure there is a large amount of padding and treat any wounds immediately to avoid infection. ​‍ ​‍ ‌
  * Watch for ulcers in your dog’s mouth. You may notice drooling and/or bad breath. Your vet can prescribe a mouthwash that can help with this. ​‍ ​‍ ‌



#### **What is the Best Homemade Diet for Dogs With Kidney Disease?**

The best homemade diet for a dog with kidney failure should focus on high-quality, easily digestible protein sources, such as lean chicken or turkey, to reduce kidney strain. Keep in mind that protein should be served in moderation. Some examples include:

  * Chicken (skinless, boneless)
  * Fish (such as salmon or whitefish)
  * Eggs (cooked, in moderation)
  * Pumpkin (pureed)
  * Sweet potatoes (cooked)
  * Rice (well-cooked white rice)
  * Carrots (cooked or raw, in moderation)
  * Green beans (steamed or cooked)



Adding omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil can help support kidney function and reduce inflammation. Additionally, incorporating ingredients like sweet potatoes and carrots provides essential vitamins and minerals while maintaining a balance of electrolytes, such as potassium, for overall health.

#### **What Not To Feed Dogs With Kidney Disease**

For a dog with kidney failure, it’s important to limit protein intake, as too much protein can stress the kidneys. However, protein should not be entirely eliminated, as dogs still need it for essential bodily functions. Avoid high-protein foods like red meat and organ meats, which can be too difficult for the kidneys to process, and focus on providing a balanced diet that meets the dog’s specific nutritional needs without overloading the kidneys. Some examples of foods to avoid include:

  * High-protein meats (e.g., beef, lamb)
  * Processed meats (e.g., bacon, sausage, deli meats)
  * Dairy products (e.g., milk, cheese, yogurt)
  * High-phosphorus foods (e.g., organ meats, certain fish)
  * High-sodium foods (e.g., canned foods, salty snacks)
  * Canned vegetables with added salt
  * Grains with gluten (e.g., wheat, barley)



## **How Long Do Dogs Live With Kidney Disease?**

The lifespan of a dog with kidney failure can vary greatly depending on factors such as the stage of the disease, overall health, and how well the condition is managed. On average, dogs diagnosed with kidney failure may live for anywhere from a few months to a few years with appropriate treatment, including diet management, medications, and regular veterinary care. Early detection and intervention can help extend a dog’s life and improve their quality of life. It's essential to work closely with a veterinarian to monitor kidney function and make adjustments to care as needed.

Dogs with chronic kidney disease can live anywhere from several months to a few years, depending on how early the disease is diagnosed and how well it is managed. Quality of life plays a significant role in longevity, as effective management through diet, medication, and supportive care can help maintain comfort and function for a longer time.

## **When To Euthanize a Dog With Kidney Disease**

Knowing when to euthanize can vary for each dog and person. Remember that there isn’t always an exact time, but a window where it is appropriate to decide to let them go. Sometimes, you can look at your beloved dog and know that the light is gone. The fight is over, and they are ready. Sometimes you cannot see the light go out, but you can see their bodies fail them. ​‍ ​‍ ‌

The end stages of kidney disease occur when the kidneys can no longer function properly, and the body is unable to respond to treatment. Your dog may become lethargic, or sleepy, and have difficulty rising. They likely have lost a significant amount of weight, and their appetite is usually diminished. They may be too nauseous to keep food down. Confusion is often a sign of late-stage disease and is caused by toxins present in the bloodstream. ​‍ ​‍ ‌

It is important to be able to look at your dog objectively and know when things change. Helpful tools are out there such as our [Pet Quality of Life Assessment](https://www.codapet.com/quality-of-life-scale). It can be helpful to keep a list of 6-8 characteristics that make your dog unique and truly “your dog”. When more than half of those things can no longer happen, it is often within that window of time. ​‍ ​‍ ‌

Your veterinarian can help you determine if your dog’s quality of life has diminished. Together, you can make an informed decision so that you can feel comfortable that you are doing the right thing. ​‍ ​‍ ‌

## **When In-Home Euthanasia May Be The Best Option**

Deciding whether to euthanize is inevitably a challenging decision. It is wise to think about how you want to have this done so that you are prepared, and you do not have to make decisions when you are panicked or in an emergency. A wonderful option is In-home euthanasia. When the veterinarian comes to you, the process can be one of the most beautiful, rewarding experiences. ​‍ ​‍ ‌

The stress level is lower because you are in the comfort of your own home with no distractions. Your veterinarian will administer an injection of sedatives, allowing your dog to have a peaceful slumber while the veins are accessed for the final injection. Other benefits of letting your pet pass away at home are that family, both human and four-legged, can be nearby to say goodbye. ​‍ ​‍ ‌
