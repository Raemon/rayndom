Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

At a very young age I developed a fascination with animals through drawing. This quickly evolved into my passion for animals and the reason of choosing the career path of becoming a veterinarian. My past experiences have led me to work with a wide variety of species ranging from biomedical primates to small and large animals. Through practicing I have found that quality medicine and care along with quality time spent with owners and pets is imperative to my values as a practitioner. In-home euthanasia allows me to embody these facets and provide optimal care to my patients in the comfort of their own home.

> Dr. Briell Dzierga came to us for in home pet euthanasia when it was time to say goodbye to our 18 year old dog. Dr. Dzierga was so caring and compassionate and really helped us get through this. She made a very difficult process as easy as it could be and explained everthing to us. She made sure we were comfortable every step of the way. I can't recommend her enough.

> Dr. Dzierga was absolutely amazing during this tough time for my family. My pup was a 18 year old black lab who lived a good life. She made his crossing painless. She helped talk us through everything. We even shared stories of Mak dog and had some laughs. It’s never easy making this decision or having to go through this kind of situation but Dr. Dziegra somehow made it easier for us. Thanks again for everything. Mak is a peace now and we are grateful for you!

> Care, compassion and empathy were in the forefront and every step of the way. This was such a hard decision to make after 15 years with our pup. Dr Dzierga was so respectful and compassionate in her assessment and through the process. We knew it was the right thing to do. We had another dog in our household for 13 years and it was important to us that she understood was happening too. While I wish this on no one, if you find yourself needing these services, I recommend Dr Dzierga with the highest regards.

She was very patient and didn't make us feel rushed, and her empathy was genuine. She assured us that we were doing the right thing and helped us feel confident in our decision, even though it was painful. I would highly recommend her a thousand times over.

> Dr. Briell was amazing! She was so patient, explained everything she was going to do before she did it, and really helped us during a very difficult time. Dr.Briell got to know our Emma which really meant a lot. Emma mattered to her and us. I had wondered if I was doing the right thing at the right time. Emma had a good day which made me double think my decision. Dr. Briell pointed out some of Emma’s behaviors as we were watching her walk around. She picked up on her pain and I could then see it too. This reassurance was priceless to me. I held my precious Emma in her final moments and was comforted in the fact that she was finally free of her pain. She was at peace. Dr. Briell then took great care of our fur baby, cradling her in a soft blanket and placing her in a new pet bed. We had asked for her to be cremated and Dr. Briell took care of that for us. Looking back, it was a very beautiful experience. We can’t thank Dr. Briell enough for her care and kindness!

> I cannot thank Dr. Briell enough for her kindness and compassion she showed our family as she helped our dog, Snickers, cross the rainbow bridge. She was so loving with Snickers and asked our family questions to get to know her better. I had phoned our veterinarian to ask for a service that would allow the procedure to be done in the comfort of Snickers' home so we wouldn't have to make her travel and be more anxious and uncomfortable. When I searched for the suggested service, I came across CodaPet and read the touching reviews of Dr. Briell and felt she was the right veterinarian for this difficult decision. I am so thankful I went with her. She is an incredibly special person for a very difficult decision that many pet families have to make. I highly recommend Dr. Briell.

> Dr. Briell Dzierga was an incredible gift to our family when we chose in home pet euthanasia for our precious 18 year old cat 🐈‍⬛ this week. She took such care and time ensuring all of us were comfortable and thoroughly understood the entire process. She went to great lengths to include our young children using age appropriate language and gentle explanations with our consent and at our request. Through all our tears, there was such peace and comfort being at home in one of our cat’s favorite spots with the sun streaming through the window as we said our goodbyes. We will be forever grateful that such a difficult time was made infinitely easier thanks to Dr. Briell Dzierga’s expertise and kindness.

> Dr. Brielle was hands down the most compassionate Vet my husband and I have ever come across. She evaluated the situation and helped us in making the right decision for Ben. She explained everything and was never pushy and took all the time we needed for questions in making our decision. I would highly recommend her if you are making the decision on helping your love one pass over rainbow bridge. I thought it was very reasonable and 100 percent less stressful than the emergency vet. RIP Ben, momma and daddy loves you ❤️ 💙

> This is written to share with you our personal experiences with the unfortunate necessity of saying ‘goodbye’ to our friend, companion and virtual family member of nearly 15 years, our dog, Baxter. Most of the time Baxter was a good boy...and, yes, once in a while, a bad boy...but he was always our boy. Baxter was a Shiba Inu and a handsome devil. He loved to run, jump, chase and frolic and shared hours of enjoyment with us. Since our children were all grown, Baxter became more than just a pet. He would sit at the table with us, never ate dog food, was most often fed his chicken and cheese (not mixed) by hand and loved to escape from the house, patrol the neighborhood for between 30 seconds and 5 minutes and then come running back through the garage, thru the open door to the kitchen to the safety of his own home. As it does with all pets, eventually time caught up with Baxter much too quickly. He slowed down and began to have other issues that seemed to be causing him pain. He had 14+ great years, but things had become more and more difficult for him over the past 12 months. This finally brought us to what seemed like the most painful conclusion we ever faced – it seemed we were trying to extend Baxter’s life – not as much for Baxter as for us. So the final decision was made and we investigated all the options, one of which was in-home pet euthanasia. We decided we wanted to be with him to comfort him during his final moments. We wanted him to be treated with dignity and compassion. And we wanted him to be comfortable with where he was and with those who loved him the most. And, yes, I will admit, we wanted it to be as free from anxiety and stress as possible for us as well. As I am typing this with tears in my eyes, I have to say that thanks to Dr. Dzierga and her team at CodaPet. She came to our home, sat with us and Baxter for an hour explaining the process, what we could expect and, most importantly how Baxter would be treated. I have to say the entire procedure was more comforting and less painful than either of us ever imagined. Baxter was lying with us and simply drifted off to sleep experiencing no pain nor any anxiety, nothing but comfort. We said not our ‘goodbyes’, but our ‘goodnights’ to our little friend, promising to see him again. The last image I have of Baxter was him wrapped in blanket like a baby being lovingly carried away. His eyes were closed as if he were only sleeping, content, at peace and free of pain. We recommend every pet owner consider in-home pet euthanasia. It is a beautiful way to say ‘goodnight’ to your ‘friend’ and give those final moments with ‘your Baxter’ the same meaning as the wonderful life you shared together. Don and Eileen Bigda

> Oh, my. I don't even know where to start about the special care Dr. Brielle gave both Carmen and me. She was not in a hurry even though it was almost 7p when she arrived because she had to travel so far from the previous appointment but she stayed two and a half hours with us. She spent a lot of time observing Carmen to insure this was the right choice and gave me so much reassurance that it was definitely the right decision. That made me feel so much better. She gave Carmen so much attention and Carmen really liked her. That means a lot. She was gentle the whole time with all she did. I just can't say enough about the care she gave us. Without a doubt, I'd highly recommend her and definitely use her again if I ever have to. Thanks so much for sending us this wonderful vet. I'm so appreciative of all she did and her methods.

> Dr Briell Dzierga with Coda Pet has handled 2 seperate euthanasia events of our Abyssinian Cats. Our first experience with Dr Dzierga was exceptionally compassionate and caring for both our beloved male Abby suffering from cancer. Most recently our Female Abby experienced stage 4 kidney failure as was in very bad shape. Dr Dzierga scheduled with us for a second time since we were sold on her approach, compassionate manner, and Vet skills overall. She explains the process in detail and uses a three step process allowing you time to be with your pet, best for the Pet and Yourself. We are convinced that our Abby’s experienced the minimum stress and the maximum love possible. I commend Dr. Dzierga for her professionalism and Compassion for the animal as well as the pet owner. We were a wreck emotionally and she helped us through the process. Dr. Dzierga is a “10” in our experience and anyone considering home Euthanasia should seriously consider the process superior to at Vet office in EVERY WAY, and Dr. Dzierga for attending to your beloved pet.

> Cupcake had been sick on and off for about a year, then one morning she got up and something had changed - she was in obvious pain. It came on very quickly and very strong. While searching on the internet, I came across Codapet. I made an appointment and Dr. Dzierga, who reached out almost immediately. Knowing she was a vet and able to answer any questions I had was amazing. She let me know what to do and what she would be doing. Cupcake over the next 24 hours got worse and, I could not imagine even trying to get her out of the house to go to her regular vet. Dr. Briell Dzierga came, and the home care final process became a beautiful experience. Considering what the process is, and to be able to say it was a beautiful experience, says a lot. I would have paid double, knowing my love one started her new journey to the other side in such a peaceful loving way while at home. Thank you for everything.

> In one of the most devastating moments of our lives, we were fortunate to be met with extraordinary compassion. The At- home euthanasia of our beloved Doberman, Lex, was carried out with such tenderness and compassion by the deeply kind and understanding Dr. Briell Dzierga. Her presence brought a sense of calm into our home-transforming what could have been purely heartbreaking into something peaceful, respectful and full of love. She took the time to listen, to honor Lex’s life, and to make sure every step was handled with gentle care. Her demeanor was both professional and profoundly human; she understood the depth of our pain and offered quiet support that made all the difference. While saying goodbye is never easy, Dr. Dzierga helped us navigate it with grace, we’re so thankful that even in sorrow, we were surrounded by kindness.

I had to make the hardest decision for my 14 year old girl, Frayya, and she was able to come to our home where she remained the most comfortable and surrounded with her family until the very end. Her patience, sweetness, and understanding was everything we needed to get through but it was the attention to detail which made it even more special. I received the most thoughtful letter in the mail and even her paw print was special as she captured Frayya’s weird double dewclaw. Thank you for your caring heart and your service to our community.

> I have never been through having a pet passing away at home.Dr. Briell Is the most wonderful, Caring, considerate and compassionate Dr I have ever met. She came to the house to help with ziva, She couldn’t have been kinder as if it was her own cat. She treated Ziva with love and compassion. She made sure that Ziva was comfortable. She never rushed us. She even had our other cat come in to see what was going on. In our time of grieving, Ziva couldn’t have been taken care of By anybody better. She made the process absolutely bearable. She knew that my husband had passed away recently and on her way with Ziva ( my husbands favorite) she saw a rainbow and texted me to say that she’s going over the rainbow bridge and John was welcoming her. It meant the world to me . Thank you, you truly are amazing. ❤️

> Our family felt an instant connection with Dr. Briell Dzierga. Not only is she the best vet I have ever met, she is an incredibly gentle and loving person. She guided my husband and I through one of the most the difficulty journeys of our life; saying goodbye to our beloved 15 yr. old schnorkie. I had incredible pain staking anxiety the days leading up, but the second I saw her face and she met Yang (our 15yr old schnorkie) we all felt as ease. I immediately felt my dogs body relax (which he never does) which told me he was ready to go. I could not have asked for a better experience. It was a truly peaceful, loving and understanding experience among all. One in which I will never forget, but in a way that gives me joy and peace instead of heart ache. Thank you Dr. Briell Dzierga, we will never forget you and I thank you for this incredible life changing experience.

> Dr. Briell Dzierga was wonderful. This was our first time using an in home pet euthanasia service. We never knew this was even an option until recently. We knew we wanted our furbaby, Misty Day, to pass with us at home and not in some strange place she visits once a year. Dr. Dzierga explained the process to us and got to know us. She listened as we grieved and shared stories. She didn't rush us and she helped talk to our 8 year old who wanted to be there, too, to say goodbye to her grandparents cat. She handled all the cremation and transfer details and gave us a sweet pawprint keepsake. She explained everything and all our options for arrangements. No pressure. She was so, so kind. We received a sweet condolence card where she had so much detail on all the personal stories we shared. I would highly recommend her and her services. We loved her! ❤️ Christina, Damien and Esmae Adeline

She also had treats and was quite generous with them. I know Lucy, (always a food motivated doggie) had at least 8 or 10, so she went over the rainbow bridge with a full belly. She even took a paw print and cut some of her hair for us. The whole procedure right down to Pet Rest, that came to transport her to the cremation facility, was done very reverently and empathetically throughout the whole ordeal. I had her ashes returned to me within two days and there was a beautiful card and a cast of her paw included along with my chosen container. I highly recommend Dr. Briell and Pet Rest. They took an otherwise traumatic experience and made it bearable.

> Dr. Briell Dzierga is an angel. We had to say goodbye to our sweet 20yr old kitty, Belle, two weeks ago. Dr. Dzierga was more amazing and wonderful than I could have wished for. I can't even put into words. She did not rush us during the process. It was a peaceful process. We are still grieving but Dr. Dzierga was the most caring person I've ever met and, when it comes time for our other senior kitties, I will be calling Dr. Dzierga.

> When we found out that our dog Hercules was diagnosed with Lymphoma and given only weeks to live, we were devastated! He was only 4 years old and was such a good dog. I was terrified of the idea of euthanizing my baby. I couldn't imagine that my dog's last moment was going to be at the Vet's office. A friend of mine told me about in-home pet euthanasia and explained every detail of their experience. Although our hearts were torn, we decided that not only was it the best service for our family, but it was also the best for Hercules. Everything was explained so well, step by step, in a manner in which our children were comfortable with saying goodbye to their friend at home. Each last moment that was spent with him was filled with sadness, joy, and hope. We were honored to be there for him as he transitioned. Although we were sad to let him go, we were happy that he met a peaceful and dignified end. We decided to have Herculese cremated and brought back home. I received a beautiful urn and my fur baby will be at home with me forever. I highly recommend Dr Briell Dzierga at CodaPet!

> Dr Briell is a wonderful vet who was kind, considerate and extremely thoughtful. She understands what a pet means to a family. She allowed our family private time to say goodbye and helped us keep our composure during the process. Dr Briell explained step by step the procedure she was about to perform and ensured us Willie would suffer no pain. She kept her word and Willie passed very peacefully. Out of her kindness she gave us Willie's paw prints and later a beautiful card was mailed to us. Dr Briell is a very caring and special person. She gets a very high recommendation from us.

> Dr. Brielle Dzierga came to my house to put my cat Poe down as he had bad kidney failure. I was expecting the usual wham bam couple of shots and all done. I could not have been more wrong. From the moment Dr. Dzierga came, my cat and I were enveloped in a cocoon of such care, compassion and patience to an almost unbelievable level. She was at my house for almost 2 hours. explaining everything slowly, encouraging me to share about my life with him. Just incredible. Every empathetic thing that could be done, was done. She was very careful about not frightening him. As I told Brielle, her being a vet is not a job but a calling. God placed her in this role so her compassionate and caring nature could comfort others. I would give 100 stars if I could. Brielle is exceptional!! Office staff also were lovely. Should you need this service, this is the place to call.

> Dr. Briell Dzierga was an incredible gift to our family when we chose in home pet euthanasia for our precious 18 year old cat 🐈‍⬛ this week. She took such care and time ensuring all of us were comfortable and thoroughly understood the entire process. She went to great lengths to include our young children using age appropriate language and gentle explanations with our consent and at our request. Through all our tears, there was such peace and comfort being at home in one of our cat’s favorite spots with the sun streaming through the window as we said our goodbyes. We will be forever grateful that such a difficult time was made infinitely easier thanks to Dr. Briell Dzierga’s expertise and kindness.

> The fact that I had the option to have someone come make saying goodbye easier at home was incredible for 1 thing, but Dr. Briell made us feel very comfortable that our baby was in the right hands to carry on. This was my first time going through this with my first pet, so she was very supportive and understanding of my decision. Having your pet at home where they are most comfortable was probably the best thing I could have done for my dog and I would do it again.

> I had to put my husband‘s cat to sleep today I couldn’t have asked for more thoughtful, caring, considerate, and compassionate Doctor Brielle. She was understanding and treated Ziva like it was her own. She took her time, explained everything. It was a very hard decision to make, but she made it possible with love. She took her time to make sure Ziva was comfortable. She even brought my other cat Jethro in to make sure he was aware of what was going on. She knew that my husband had just passed away and when she took Ziva to her final resting place, she saw a rainbow and texted me saying that Ziva went over the rainbow and John was waiting to greet her and welcome her home. That meant the world to me . Such a compassionate dr. Thank you for being who you are…. AMAZING

She explained everything and was never pushy and took all the time we needed for questions in making our decision. I would highly recommend her if you are making the decision on helping your love one pass over rainbow bridge. I thought it was very reasonable and 100 percent less stressful than the emergency vet.

We had to say goodbye to our almost 16 yo doxie mix, Stella, suffering from renal failure, right after the new year. Knowing how nervous she always was going to the vet, letting her pass in peace at home was very important to us. Dr. Briell took the time to speak with us, layout, exactly what would happen and this time allowed Stella to be at ease. Thankful that her heart led to her to help families in this situation.

> I recently had to say goodbye to my 15 year old pup, Emma. It was an extremely difficult decision. Dr. Briell Dzierga came by and sat on the floor with us while we went over our options. She was so kind and understanding, and reassured me that I was acting in the best interest of my elderly and ailing dog. I miss that pup so much, but I am at peace with how that morning played out. Dr. Dzierga was patient and accommodating, and I could not have asked for a better person to be there for my dog's final moments. She did everything with such care and dignity. She explained to me everything that would happen and answered all of my questions. I'm grateful for her calm presence in what was a very emotionally charged situation for me. I'm also grateful that we were able to be at home instead of stressing my dog out with the unfamiliarity of the vet's office. Dr. Dzierga then followed up by sending the nicest condolences card a few days later. I will recommend this service to everyone I know with an aging pet, just so they know who to call when the time comes.

> We are so incredibly grateful to Dr. Briell Dzierga for the compassion, care, and dignity she showed during one of the hardest moments of our lives. Saying goodbye to our beloved Lacey was heartbreaking, but the way she handled the process made all the difference. From the moment she arrived at our home , we felt supported. She gave us time, explained everything gently, and treated our dog with the utmost respect and tenderness. The room was calm and quiet, and she never rushed us—allowing us the space to say goodbye in our own way. It was clear she truly understood the depth of the bond we had with our pet. Though this was one of the most difficult decisions we’ve ever had to make, we had a deep sense of peace, knowing our dog passed away without fear or pain, surrounded by love. Thank you, Dr. Briell Dzierga, for your empathy, professionalism, and heart. We will never forget how you helped us through this.

> Dr Dzierga went above and beyond for our family on what was a very difficult day. I saw that our 20 year old cat was going downhill very quickly and had to make the decision no one wants to make. I made the appointment for Dr Briell to come to our house to help our kitty cross the rainbow bridge. She was able to come a few hours later. Unfortunately, Crystal took matters into her own hands and passed before our scheduled appointment. Dr Briell arranged the cremation and return of Crystal, made sure we had pawprints and nose prints, and was just so very caring with all the details and with us. She asked about Crystal's origin story and sincerely listened. She went over everything in detail and left nothing out. She sent a lovely note with Crystal when she came home. I am forever grateful that Dr Briell was here to help make a difficult day a little bit easier. I would recommend her very highly. She does the work if an angel!

She was very compassionate. Informing me of the whole process, step by step. There was no rush, I was able to tell her all about my lovely girl and felt assured, by our conversation, that it was indeed the right time to let my sweet cat go. It was one of the hardest decisions I've ever made. The ability to have it done in my home, allowed my girl to go peacefully, without any added stress of being couped up in a carrier and driven to the vet. There was no fear added to the mix. She was home, on my lap, getting all the love as she drifted off. She was ready, even though my heart wasn't...

> Dr. Briell was amazing! She was so patient, explained everything she was going to do before she did it, and really helped us during a very difficult time. Dr.Briell got to know our Emma which really meant a lot. Emma mattered to her and us. I had wondered if I was doing the right thing at the right time. Emma had a good day which made me double think my decision. Dr. Briell pointed out some of Emma’s behaviors as we were watching her walk around. She picked up on her pain and I could then see it too. This reassurance was priceless to me. I held my precious Emma in her final moments and was comforted in the fact that she was finally free of her pain. She was at peace. Dr. Briell then took great care of our fur baby, cradling her in a soft blanket and placing her in a new pet bed. We had asked for her to be cremated and Dr. Briell took care of that for us. Looking back, it was a very beautiful experience. We can’t thank Dr. Briell enough for her care and kindness!
