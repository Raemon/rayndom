Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I became a Veterinarian because I enjoyed working with people and animals, and thought I could do both as a Veterinarian. I have practiced small animal medicine and surgery for the past 31 years in a clinical setting, and am ready for a change in settings. I have preformed many euthanasias in those years, and my heart still hurts for those folks that have to say good bye to their 4 legged buddies. Euthanasia decisions are never easy, but I feel like it is our responsibility to make the process and painless and as compassionate as possible for both the pet and their family.

## What pet parents are saying

> Dr. Stadler was very kind and made a difficult situation easier. It was the best decision for my kitty and myself as Ruby was very shy and fearful cat and this was a calm, caring procedure for her. I had been dreading the whole process of a trip to the vet's office and this home service was less stressful, efficient, and private.

> She was so calming and supportive of our whole family going through this difficult time. Took the time to share with us every step of the process and when it was time to do each thing. Gave us plenty of time to say goodbye, before and after. She made our Dusty's journey over the rainbow bridge very peaceful, and help us go through it.

> Gabby my 13 yr shepherd mix was have trouble walking her back legs didn’t work so well. Her heart was all in. However I finally made the call. Dr. Lisa Stadler truly helped with her calm manner and understanding. The fireplace was on the TV off as we talked softly sometimes laughed at the memories we shared. Gabby gently quieted after the first relaxing shot as I stroked her and talked to her too. My other two pets and my husband surrounded her with family love as she went peacefully to the rainbow bridge to see her past friends. Highly recommend this home option for the pet and the owners. Thank you

> Dr. Stadler was exceptional. I could not have asked for a better experience during such a difficult time for my family. From the moment she arrived, Dr. Stadler was incredibly sweet with our dog, showing such gentle care. She explained everything that was going to happen with clarity and compassion. What truly touched us was that she sat with us and listened as we shared some of our favorite stories about our dog, allowing us to cherish those last moments and memories. Dr. Stadler gave us plenty of time to say our goodbyes before allowing us to accompany her to her vehicle to see our dog off for the final time. I could not recommend her more highly.

> She was very compassionate and caring. I'm still distraught, but she helped us get through a very difficult time. I would definitely recommend her. I had to put another baby to sleep 15 years ago, and we took him to the vet. This time our Lucy was in her front yard with all her friends around her and she just went to sleep.

> Dr. Lisa did an amazing job with not only Jaxs but with the family as well. Lisa had actually been with Jaxs from the beginning, she took care of him as a pup so no one better than for her to be there when it was time for him to be put to rest. We were able to take Jaxs to his favorite sunning place amongst the grapevines. Lisa told us exactly was she what she was going to do every step of the way. Thanks again Lisa for making this process a little easier for our family!❤️

> We are incredibly grateful for the compassionate care we received during one of the hardest moments of our lives. Dr. ___ came to our home to help us say goodbye to our beloved dog, and her empathy and gentleness were truly remarkable. She explained every step of the process with clarity and kindness, checking in with us often to make sure we were comfortable and prepared. She gave us all the time we needed to say our final goodbyes and treated our pup with such tenderness and respect. It’s clear she has helped many families through this experience—she balances professional skill with a deep understanding of the human emotion involved. We couldn’t have asked for a more supportive presence, and we are so thankful for the care she provided.

> Our entire experience from start to finish was positive as it could possibly be! Lisa was a great communicator, kind and compassionate. We scheduled our appointment a couple days out, during that time she was in contact through text, gave us support and advice and keeping our kitty the most comfortable. Being able to say goodbye Angel, in her own home, meant so very much to all of us. Lisa was very organized and professional provided excellent medical support for our cat and emotional support for us. Lisa provided us the opportunity to say goodbye to Angel in the most comfortable, compassionate way possible. 10 out of 10 100% recommend 5 out of 5 Stars!

> Saying goodbye to our beloved dachshund Lily was one of the most painful moments of our lives, but thanks to Dr. Lisa Stadler with CodaPet, it was also one of the most peaceful and compassionate. Dr. Lisa, a retired veterinarian, brought a gentle presence and deep empathy into our home—qualities that made an unbearable day a little more bearable. Her kindness and professionalism helped guide my wife and me through the process with grace and dignity. We are overwhelmingly grateful that Lily was able to pass in the comfort of her home, surrounded by the space and the things she loved most. Holding her in my arms as she went peacefully was a blessing I will never forget. The communication with CodaPet was seamless, and scheduling the appointment was simple—something I deeply appreciated during such an emotionally difficult time. I cannot recommend CodaPet and Dr. Lisa more highly. Their service was not just professional—it was personal, compassionate, and deeply respectful. Thank you for being part of Lily’s journey, and ours. You will forever hold a place in our hearts.

> Dr. Stapler was the best. She was very compassionate and walked us through the process. She handled our baby with care and love and appreciated her at our time of need. The process of staying at home was great without having to put our baby in more stress of traveling to the vet. I would recommend this service and Dr. Stapler hands down.

> We had to say goodbye to our beloved spoiled fur baby Harley. We wanted to make sure he had a peaceful and comfortable end-of-life experience, so we decided to have him euthanized at home. I found CodaPet online and read great reviews about their services. I scheduled an appointment with Dr. Lisa Stadler who came to our house . She was so kind and compassionate, and she took the time to answer all of our questions. She also made sure that Harley was comfortable and relaxed before she gave him the injection. The whole process was very peaceful and dignified. Dr. Stadler stayed with us until Harley passed away. She gave us time to ourselves with him to say our goodbyes. So grateful to her for helping us to say goodbye to our very very spoiled baby, in the best way possible. I would highly recommend CodaPet and Dr. Lisa Stadler to anyone who is considering in-home pet euthanasia. They are compassionate and professional, and they will make sure that your pet has a peaceful and loving end-of-life experience. So thankful for all she did.

> Dr. Stadler was absolutely amazing in helping us through this process. She reached out a few days in advance, offering helpful suggestions to manage our dog’s pain while we wait for our date. When she arrived at our house, she was incredibly compassionate, listened to our stories, and never once judged us. I felt horrible about everything because our baby was having a good day and was acting normal, but Dr. Stadler explained that this was likely due to the adrenaline from new people. She made me feel at ease with our decision. She explained every step of the process and gave us time to adjust. It was clear she truly cared about our dog’s comfort and well-being. I’m so grateful that we were able to give our baby the peaceful goodbye she deserved, in the comfort of our home and surrounded by loved ones as she crossed the Rainbow Bridge. 💕🐾

> I was unaware that in home pet euthanasia was an option until my dog was diagnosed with hemangiosarcoma and took a turn for the worse. I was able to easily schedule an allotment through CodaPet and have Dr. Stadler arrive the next day. Although it was an extremely challenge decision to make I was put at ease knowing that my dog was able to stay at home instead of going into a veterinarian where she would have been uncomfortable. Dr. Stadler was great and I am appreciative of the service she offers.
