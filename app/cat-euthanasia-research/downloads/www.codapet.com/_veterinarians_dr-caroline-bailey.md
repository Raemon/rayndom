Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I've wanted to become a vet for as long as I can remember. I've always felt very strongly that euthanasia is one of the most important things that we do for our patients and their families. Veterinarians have the unique privilege of helping families decide when and how their pet's story will end. We can end a life when there is suffering. We are tasked not only with keeping our patients alive and healthy, but knowing when, for whatever reason, continuing may not be in the pets or family's best interests. In home euthanasia provides the opportunity to have as stress-free an experience as possible. No need to disturb a painful patient to transport them to the veterinary clinic. In general, we can complete the procedure wherever you and/or your pet are the most comfortable. I’ll talk with you prior to your appointment, and we will discuss any concerns that you might have. What family members want to be present? Do you expect your pet to be anxious or reactive? Together we will develop a personalized plan to make the appointment go as smoothly as possible for everyone.

## What pet parents are saying

> I hesitate to write and share this, but I want to save any grieving pet owners heartache if possible. If I could turn back time, I would choose anyone else. The vet hospital might have been better. Dr. Bailey was really cold and lacked compassion. She shoved tranquilizers into my dog who was upset without consenting us as soon as she arrived and was really hasty and rough throughout the process. It felt like she was there just to do her job and get out. She was not even gentle with my dogs body as he was being placed in a bag or taken away - she made it feel like he was just an object. I do not recommend spending your last moments with your dog with Dr Bailey. The whole point of doing a home euthanasia was to send him peacefully and to do it with someone who could make us feel at ease. Neither of these things were accomplished.

> Dr. Bailey was kind and supportive. The process was described to us and was done with professionalism. Rocky passed peacefully with his whole family surrounding him in his bed. We made the right decision and the best choice to have him pass at home without any trauma or additional pain. I would recommend Dr. Bailey and Coda Pet for a dignified passing of your own fur baby.

> I really appreciated Dr. Baileys compassion and support during a difficult time. Her effort to allow our dog to pass in a familiar environment in as peaceful a way possible meant a lot to our family. As difficult as these experiences are I'm grateful for how everything went and would definitely recommend her for anyone considering in home euthanasia.

> Dr. Bailey made one of our family’s hardest moments as peaceful as it could have possibly gone. Though it was difficult, our dog was able to move on to his next life at home, peacefully, with dignity, and surrounded by those who loved him most. Our family highly recommends Dr. Bailey and would certainly call for her if we found ourselves in this situation again. Thank you, Dr. Bailey.

> Dr. Bailey was amazing and so supportive of our entire family as we dealt with putting Elsa to rest. We couldn’t have been more pleased with the respect she showed our dog. Elsa was happy as Dr. Bailey explained the process and eased her into receiving the medications. We are very thankful for Dr. Bailey’s support.
