Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

My enduring passion for veterinary medicine traces its roots back to my earliest memories of being surrounded by animals. From a young age, it was clear to me that I wanted to dedicate my life to caring for these incredible beings. My career aspirations have taken various forms over the years, from envisioning myself as an animal trainer for movies or captivating audiences at Sea World to picturing a future as a ranch owner tending to a diverse array of animals. However, beneath these varied dreams, the unchanging core has always been the desire to become a veterinarian. What propels my aspiration in the field of veterinary medicine even further is my desire to practice In-Home Euthanasia (IHE). This passion has been amplified by my firsthand experiences of the profound positive effects animals can have on human well-being, some experiences I've gained primarily through my involvement with Aggieland Pets with a Purpose (APWAP). These organizations have shown me the immense power of the human-animal bond, and they've underscored my dedication to preserving and enhancing this bond. I offer in-home euthanasia services as a compassionate way to honor the strong connections people share with their pets during one of life's most challenging transitions. This is a meaningful path that allows me to not only ensure the health of animals but also to support and educate owners about the sensitive and emotional aspects of saying goodbye to their beloved companions.

> I am writing to express my heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Pruett for her exceptional care and support. From the very beginning, it was clear that Dr. Pruett was not only a highly skilled veterinarian but also deeply compassionate and dedicated to providing the best possible experience for both my cat and I. Understanding my concerns about my cat's anxiety and the importance of a friendly environment, Dr. Pruett went above and beyond to ensure that our experience was as stress-free as possible. Her approach was not just professional but also incredibly warm and empathetic. Thanks to Dr. Pruett my memories are not solely marked by pain and grief they are also filled with the presence of an awesome professional and an incredibly empathetic human being, filled with kindness. In a way, whenever I begin to mourn, I find solace in remembering the extensive care Dr. Pruett provided for both of us. I am truly grateful for the outstanding level of care and attention we received at CodaVet and from Dr. Pruett. Dr. Pruett you are my hero. Thank you for being there, for your kindness, patience, and for making such a positive impact.

> In such an emotional and difficult time, Dr Pruett was perfect in her demeanor, giving us information about the process, making my wife and I and Siobhan comfortable for the process, and quietly performing the process, and helping Siobhan to a calm, quiet transition. After Siobhan’s passing, Dr Pruett's help was greatly comforting and the "paw prints" memorial was a blessed keepsake.

> Folks I will say I have a lot of animals, our oldest family member Trigger was bound for the afterlife, he made a turn for the worst so we decided to put him down. We have never done this before in my family and we wanted him to pass away on our property and we have a pet cemetery on our property. We contacted this group and they provided a Dr. near by. This Dr. Pruett from the beginning of scheduling which was last min and a rush on top of that, came to the house. The entire time she was here she was a complete angel. She made my three daughters and wife and I completely comfortable. I was the hardest thing I have had to do as Trigger was my oldest daughter’s dog. Dr. pruett was right by our side the whole time and really just an absolute, definition of a real doctor in my book. Bedside manner top notch, she was ahead of schedule, texted me with updated time all the way up until she pulled in the drive. Talked to my girls like a long time friend, even gave my oldest a hug before she left. She brought a paw casting kit to take his print for the girls to keep forever. She did that on her own, I didn’t ask for that. I would never use another service if I had to do this again. Listen to me do it at home if you can not at an office. He was very loved up until the last second and had the entire family here. Thank you so much for giving us Dr. Pruett and thank you for being here in our dark time.

> Dr. Pruett is wonderful, she is so kind and compassionate. She took such intentional care our very loved companion Buddy during his passing and the time after. We couldn’t have asked for a more peaceful passing for him here at home, comfortable and surrounded by love. We greatly appreciate Dr. Pruett and CodaPet. We are thankful that such incredible, kind, compassionate vets like her exist. -Shayne and Travis

> My favorite words Dr Pruitt said, is, “I’ll let myself out.” She hugged me and didn’t linger. She let me experience my own grief in the comfort of my home. The week before I went with my sister to euthanize her cat at her vet clinic. They didn’t give her any time after and just waited in the room to take the body of her precious pet away. I felt so off-put by this. I didn’t mention it to my sister. But, I’m going to save money just to use your services

> As you all know our pets don’t live long enough and frequently we have to say goodbye to each one of them too soon. Euthanasia in veterinarians office or Vetranarian hospital is cold. Coda Pet and Dr. Pruett gave our family peace of mind when dealing with the loss of our beloved Katy Belle. I highly recommend Coda Pet.

> Dr. Pruett was so gentle with us and Zoey. She has so much compassion. I did not want my Zoey to have to go through a 45 minute drive to our old vet as she has always been anxious in car rides. She passed away on her own terms comfortable at home with us. We miss her dearly but we are happy that she is finally out of pain. Dr. Pruett treated Zoey with respect, compassion and dignity. We will always be thankful for her help with our family.

> Dr. Pruett was so compassionate, so patient and so gentle with our Sweet Pea. We are so grateful she came to our home and handled this for us. It was totally worth it to go this route. CodaPet was so easy to work with, very compassionate as well. I called, made the appointment and waited for the appointment day which was not long at all. We basically got the date we asked for. I would most definitely recommend CodaPet to those who dearly love their pets. I cannot say enough about the ease and comfort received from both.

> Alex was wonderful with Levi. He was our boy for 13 years and it was VERY hard to let him go. She did a great job of talking us through the process, She took her time and gave us plenty of time to grieve. She handled the sedation process flawlessly. You could tell she cared about Levi as well as us. We would highly recommend her for this very difficult process.
