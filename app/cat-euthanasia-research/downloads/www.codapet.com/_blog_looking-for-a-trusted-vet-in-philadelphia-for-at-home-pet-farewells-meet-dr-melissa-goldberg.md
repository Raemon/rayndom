When a family’s beloved pet nears the end of life, Dr. Melissa Goldberg offers a caring and peaceful alternative to traditional veterinary clinics. Serving Philadelphia and nearby communities, she specializes in in-home pet euthanasia services, allowing pets to pass surrounded by the comfort of their own home and familiar surroundings. With more than 26 years in veterinary medicine, Dr. Goldberg brings extensive experience and a thoughtful approach that honors the unique bond between pets and their families.

## **A Lifelong Dedication to Veterinary Care**

Dr. Goldberg’s passion for veterinary medicine began early in childhood, sparked by a desire to help animals. She earned her undergraduate degree at Rutgers University, followed by a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from Iowa State University. Returning to the Philadelphia area, she built a rich career encompassing general practice, surgery, and nonprofit rescue work. Over her decades of experience, Dr. Goldberg has developed a deep understanding of both medical needs and the emotional aspects of pet care, making her especially attuned to the delicate moments surrounding end-of-life decisions.

## **Choosing In-Home Care: A Personal Shift**

After many years working in busy veterinary hospitals, Dr. Goldberg made the intentional decision to focus on in-home euthanasia services. She explains, “I wanted to provide families and their pets with a more peaceful, less clinical experience during those final moments. Hospitals can be stressful for pets and overwhelming for families. Bringing care directly into the home allows for comfort, dignity, and a sense of calm that’s hard to replicate elsewhere.” This transition reflects her commitment to prioritizing emotional well-being alongside medical expertise.

## **Families Appreciate Her Thoughtful and Patient Care**

Pet owners frequently highlight Dr. Goldberg’s calm and reassuring presence during difficult times. One family shared, “Dr. Goldberg was incredibly kind and thoughtful. She even sent a sympathy card days after our dog’s passing, which meant a lot to us during that tough time.”

Other families reflected on the peacefulness she brought to their 16-year-old Rottweiler’s final moments: “From the moment she arrived, we felt a wave of relief. She patiently explained every step and allowed us the time we needed. Otis passed peacefully in his favorite spot at home, surrounded by family. It was by far the most gentle and respectful farewell we have ever experienced.” Many families emphasize how Dr. Goldberg’s steady guidance and warmth helped them navigate grief with dignity and love.

## **Tailored Services with Transparent Pricing**

Committed to providing families with clear options and respectful service, Dr. Goldberg offers:

  * **At-Home Pet Euthanasia** starting at **$350** , which includes a gentle pre-sedation and the procedure itself in the comfort of your home.
  * **Pet Cremation Services** ranging from **$145 to $390** , offering both private and communal cremation options, with careful transportation of your pet included.
  * **Memorial Keepsakes** such as clay paw prints and custom wooden urns, available from **$49 to $174** to help families honor their pets’ memories.



She asks for a minimum of three hours’ notice to schedule visits, helping families prepare while maintaining availability for urgent needs.
