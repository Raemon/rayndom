## Recognizing the Signs That It May Be Time

When a pet’s quality of life declines, they may exhibit signs indicating it’s time to consider humane euthanasia. These signs can include behavioral, physical, and emotional changes that are often difficult to witness.

## Understanding Your Pet's Quality of Life

A helpful way to assess your pet’s well-being is to track their[ good days versus bad days](https://www.codapet.com/how-will-i-know-when-its-time/navigating-quality-of-life-qol-in-pets-understanding-the-good-days-vs-bad-days-method). If the number of bad days begins to outweigh the good, it may be time to consider euthanasia. Additionally, we recommend the use of the [Quality of Life (QOL) scale](https://www.codapet.com/quality-of-life-scale) below to help pet parents gain a clear picture of their pet's day to day life quality.

### Use Our Free Quality of Life Assessment Tool

Veterinarians use Quality of Life (QOL) scales to assess physical and emotional health. They consider factors like chronic illness, pain management, and mental well-being. Regularly monitoring your pet’s QOL score can help you identify patterns and make timely decisions.

Using tools like the Quality of Life Scale can help quantify your pet’s well-being. This structured method evaluates key aspects such as pain, mobility, appetite, and daily enjoyment. It can guide you in making an informed decision about what is best for your pet.

### Try our Quality of Life Questionnaire, an interactive assessment to help gauge your pet’s comfort and happiness.
