Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

Dr. White believes that since animals so altruistically give their humans unconditional love, companionship and protection, it is our duty to strive to care for them to the highest possible standard. It is in this spirit of gratitude for our pets that Dr. White decided to pursue facilitating a dignified and compassionate ending for these beloved companions through the option of in-home euthanasia.

## What pet parents are saying

> Dr. White came to my home to help me say goodbye to my 21-year-old cat at the end of her life, and I am deeply grateful for her care and compassion. She was incredibly kind, patient, and understanding, and she never rushed us. The experience felt less like a medical procedure and more like a peaceful goodbye—almost like a small, private funeral. I appreciated being able to plan ahead with the option to cancel or reschedule if I wasn’t ready, and at no point did I feel any pressure. This was one of the hardest decisions I’ve ever had to make, but having it done at home, with such gentleness and respect, truly helped ease the pain. I can’t recommend Dr. White highly enough for anyone facing this incredibly difficult moment.
