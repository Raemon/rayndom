## What pet parents are saying

> Dr. Rexing was absolutely amazing, extremely thoughtful, and accommodating. She came to my house and help ease my dog’s transition over the rainbow bridge. She made sure to explain everything and was extremely empathetic in doing so. Was not in a rush and helped me from an emotional standpoint in so many different ways. I cannot say enough great things about her and her professionalism

> We recently had to make the incredibly difficult decision to say goodbye to our 13-year-old puggle, and we are so grateful to have had Dr. Lauren Rexing from CodaPet by our side during this emotional time. Dr. Rexing was compassionate, patient, and professional from the moment she entered our home. She took the time to answer all of our questions, gave our family space and time to be with our beloved dog, and offered comforting support both before and after the procedure. Her calm and gentle presence made an incredibly hard decision feel like the right one — helping us give our dog a peaceful and pain-free passing surrounded by love. We are deeply thankful for her care and for the service CodaPet provides.

> We’re so grateful to Dr. Rexing for helping us say goodbye to our beloved dog at home. This was our first time having a vet come to the house, and it made an incredibly hard moment much more peaceful and personal. Dr. Rexing was calm, kind, and compassionate throughout the entire process. She explained everything gently, gave us time, and helped our dog pass with dignity and comfort. We’re thankful for her care and the sense of peace she brought to our home.

> As a dog loving family having to part with our dear Max was a very difficult decision. I am not sure anyone could have made this any less painful, but Dr Lauren Rexing’s care and compassion for not only us, but our loved one was amazing. She took her time with us and Max, enabling a private and compassionate time together. Her we are on your and Max’s time really showed she understands that pets are a part of you and your family. I hate to think I will ever have to do this again with our other dogs, but if I do, she will be who I call. Thank you Dr. Lauren…

> When my beloved 15-year-old tuxedo cat could no longer support himself on one rear leg due to a tumor in his hip, had lost much of his muscle mass, and was ready to give up his struggle, Dr. Rexing came to help him on his final journey. The Big Guy, aka Share Khan, was a tough old alley cat who got to retire on a farm in country. He didn’t generally like people, but he chose me to be his human and showed me a lot of love and affection over the years, he deserved the best passing possible. Dr. Rexing gave him that. She treated the patient, my boy, with abundant care, compassion, empathy, warmth, love and respect; while exercising the utmost professionalism, precision, diligence, and skill. She touched him gently with genuine loving care. My heart tells me that the Big Guy felt no pain or anxiety. Dr. Rexing took the time to explain every step of the process, every step of the procedure. She examined the patient to be sure that there was no likelihood of cure or recovery, and that euthanasia was the right thing to do. She continually assured us that there was no hurry. Dr. Rexing treated the moment with all the reverence that it deserved. In contrast, I asked a local vet if they did home visits for euthanasia, their answer was: “Yeah, sure, I can do that, we usually schedule those for lunch hours.” You can just imagine. I wouldn’t want my guy to go out like that, with a vet just going through the motions, anxious to get back to their busy practice. A pet’s passing from this life is the most solemn and sacred moment between them and their family; it was a true blessing to have a vet like Dr. Rexing, who understands and believes this. She even made a special trip out of her area, on a holiday, to come to us. For all of the forgoing reasons, if you are faced with a similar sad situation, I give a full-hearted and unequivocal recommendation for Dr. Rexing to care for your pet in their last moments. I also want to praise Codapet’s Coordinator, Jessica, with whom I spoke several times on the phone, who made all the arrangements for Dr. Rexing to come to our home. She genuinely cared; it was not just a job for her. She likewise exhibited enormous compassion, empathy, and warmth, sharing tears with me in fact, while still being professional and highly competent. Plus, she has kept in touch to make sure we were all doing well.

> It has taken some time to find words, alas. Lauren did a fabulous job of leading Leo and his folks through the process of departure. Leo's response was grateful resolution, I sensed. The humans were happy to be expertly ushered from dread to relief. We had done in-home euthanasia once before. It was most likely better than the clinic would have been, but it was not ideal. Lauren's final walk with Leo was everything he or we could have hoped for. Thank you, Lauren. Leo in better days: https://vimeo.com/51600401 https://verdadbelleza.wordpress.com/

> It has taken me a few weeks to get my thoughts together enough to even discuss this. Pip was my best friend just a few months shy of 20 years. It was very important to me that his last days and moments were as comfortable as possible. Dr. Rexing was the absolute best I could have asked for. Seeing how calm and relaxed he was during the procedure meant everything to me. It was the first time I'd heard him purr in over a month. And I was able to hold him the entire time. It was one of the hardest decisions I've ever had to make, but I don't regret anything at all. I know I did what was best for my buddy and I'm incredibly grateful Dr. Rexing was able to be there for the both of us. Thank you so much.

> We really cannot say enough kind things about Dr. Lauren Rexing. She made such a tragic time bearable and was extremely compassionate and caring. I only wish she could have been our vet for our sweet girl prior to having to do the at home euthanasia. I was so very thankful we were able to let our girl go at home in her place where she was at peace. Forever thankful for Dr. Lauren Rexing, and we HIGHLY recommend her to anyone who is needing at home euthanasia.
