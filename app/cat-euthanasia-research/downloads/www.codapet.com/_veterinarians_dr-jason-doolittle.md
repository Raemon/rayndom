Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

After performing hundreds of euthanasias over the years, I know how difficult it is to say good-bye to a pet in an office-type setting with noises, sights, and smells that are unfamiliar to the pet. I decided to offer in-home euthanasia to honor the bond that people have with their pets and to make the experience as stress-free as possible to everyone involved.

## What pet parents are saying

> Dr. Jason Doolittle showed so much compassion during what was a very trying time. He had experienced a pet with a similar form of cancer and understood what I was dealing with. I was also surprised to discover that if you choose cremation, he will pick up and return the ashes to you so you don't have to pick them up.

> HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE with LACK of DIGNITY!!!! I couldn't believe how heart-breaking this experience was for our family. We had to put our 14 year old maltipoo down, and assumed doing this at home would be the most peaceful option. But, the experience was anything but peaceful. The vet who came to our home, Dr. Doolittle (that is actually his name) was unprepared. He showed up with his teenage son in the car. He had to leave to go out to his car several times because he kept forgetting what he needed. Once our sweet Prince was sedated, he began the euthanasia. We thought this would be a simple procedure, but no...this is where it gets horrifying. He shaved one paw, only to stick our dog 6-7 times. And not regular sticks, really forceful sticks. Then he proceeded to another paw, needing to reposition our sweet boy to reach it. He was VERY ROUGH, yanking our dog almost out of our arms by his back legs without warning, making his head roll backwards. He then stuck him another 10-12 times, before again having to try another paw. At this point, we were all freaking out. I asked him nicely to be gentle when moving our sweet baby again, but he was still rough! Finally, on the third paw after a total of 20-25 sticks, he was able to find a vein and complete the process. It was miserable and nerve-racking. There was no peace. There was no dignity. I am writing this because I can't stand the thought of another pet parent enduring such pain. He took what could have been a beautiful goodbye and turned it into a traumatic memory..one that continues to play in my mind.

> Our family was so grateful that Dr. Doolittle came to our home to assist our precious Koda pass without pain. Dr. Doolitte is a very empathetic and compassionate Vet; he also not only understood our heartbreak but explained the process of euthanasia. He was very gentle with Koda. Our family had comforted our precious senior German Shepherd in the stressful hours when we realized his time had come. He could not be moved so having Codapet come to our home truly made Koda’s passing very calm, peaceful and surrounded by loving family in the peaceful environment of his home rather than a clinical environment with strangers. When we realized Koda was closer to death than our appointment, Dr. Doolitte was able to come earlier, which not only helped Koda but our fears as well. Truly, I cannot say enough gratitude for Dr. Doolittle. It was a blessing that HE was the Vet who came to our home. Koda was calm, comfortable, unafraid, had no pain, and simply closed his eyes to our world. If you have a pet that cannot be moved or taken to your Vet - especially a paralyzed. senior 100 lb dog -, I highly recommend Codapet.

> Dr. Doolittle arrived within 2 hours of contacting CodaPet on a Saturday. He was very caring and explained the entire process clearly. He took our Bella with him and she was returned to us in a beautiful cedar box less than a week later. Dr. Doolittle even checked on how we were doing a week or so later.

> Dr. Doolittle did a wonderful job working with us during our final goodbyes with my 17 year old dog. We were able to focus on the moments with our dog instead of worry about the experience or what to expect, since he walked us through exactly what to expect. I would 100% recommend this option for any pet parent that wants a peaceful, calm, loving goodbye.

> We decided to use CodaPet when it was time for us to make that decision for our sweet 14 year old St Bernard, Fiona. It was the best thing we could have done. Dr Jason Doolittle made sure the experience was peaceful and went at a pace we were comfortable with. He explained in detail everything that would happen and was very gentle with Fiona. Thank you for providing a service that allows our fur family to go peacefully in their homes surrounded by comforting faces and love.

> Our Buford, weighing over 200lbs and not being able to walk, needed to be euthanized. Without the service of Dr. Doolittle coming to our home; this would have been not just a sad time for us, but a literal nightmare for us to figure out and beyond painful for Buford to get to a vet clinic. Dr. Doolittle was so respectful of our situation, of Buford in the moment, and of each person there with Buford saying goodbye. We thank him for his professionalism and kindness in a rough time for our family.
