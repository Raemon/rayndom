Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I wanted to become a veterinarian so that I could make a difference. When I was in college, I had a deep interest in science and research, and I loved to challenge myself. I was fortunate as a child to have parents that understood my love for animals and would allow me to "bring home the strays", so to speak. I worked for several years in the restaurant industry before deciding to use my gifts with people and animals, as well as my science background, to pursue my dream of becoming a veterinarian. I believe in the golden rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. To me, this means treating the people I meet and the pets I take care of with respect, dignity, and compassion. I liken being a veterinarian to a pediatrician: Since both pets and small children cannot always communicate to me what is wrong, or where it hurts, it is up to me to listen to the pet parent and use what they say to help diagnose and treat their pet.

## What pet parents are saying

> Our cat, Alexandra, could not recover from her liver and gallbladder problems. Loading her in the car, which she hates, driving to the vet seemed like torture. Mercifully, we found CodaPet and Dr. Deborah Perzak. Even before we met, I was impressed and relieved at the confirmation text and email and the options to ask questions. Dr. Perzak arrived at 3:00 exactly on a Sunday and entered our home respectfully. She took a brief history of Alex with a quick hands on check using soothing words. Dr. Perzak explained the steps of the process even though we had previously been through this heart-breaking procedure in years' past. I sat with Alex on the bed where we had snuggled the previous night. With her head on my leg, I was able to assure Alex that soon she would be pain free. We sat together until I was ready to let her go. Dr. Perzak carefully bundled Alex carry her out and made all the necessary cremation details. If "it is time" let Dr. Perzak help you and your beloved pet.

> We are grateful that CodaPet made the difficult process of saying goodbye to our father's dog peaceful. Dr. Perzak was very compassionate; she stayed in touch with us prior to the appointment, answered all our questions and addressed our concerns, and was patient and caring during the process. Bear hated the vet's office, so it was wonderful to avoid that trauma and allow him to stay in his familiar home surrounded by love from his pack and family.

> When my 17-year-old little cat, Be’en, took a nosedive with his health one day not long ago, I was gutted, of course, but even more so at the thought of subjecting him to a trip to the vet. My vet kindly sent me a list of options for at-home euthanasia, and I was beyond relieved to find that Dr. Perzak was available later that afternoon. As Be’en and I waited for her, it was very clear that he was ready to go. Dr. P showed up exactly when she said she would and did everything possible to make both Be’en and me comfortable. Her warmth, understanding, and consideration for both of us touched me deeply, and I’m beyond grateful that she made it possible for me to give Be’en this last gift of a quiet passing at home, in his bed, in my arms. Thank you, Dr. P.

> Dr. Perzak has been our Angel…since 2012 when she met and began care of our Ailey until recently (November 2025) when she lovingly guided Ailey to eternal peace and comfort through at-home euthanasia. Dr. Perzak surrounded us with her love, kindness and care during each step of the process. Her professional and empathetic manner are second to none. Ailey will be forever in our hearts. She is in HIS purrrrrrfect home, playful and happy. Dr. Perzak will be forever in hearts.

> We cannot say enough good things about Dr Deborah Perzak and CodaPet. In the days immediately following Hurricane Helene, our beloved cat Samantha's (Sammy's) health declined very quickly. We knew it was the end for her, and she was suffering significantly. But because so much of the State was out of power and no Veteranarian hospitals were open, we could only watch with our hearts breaking for our poor Sammy. On the recommendation of our friends, we contacted CodaPet, and despite the lack of power and difficult roads, Dr Perzak was able to meet us that day. The experience was so professional but personal as well. We were able to put her on the grass where we knew Sammy was the most comfortable and that is where she administered the medicines to put her to sleep and send her on her way. She wrapped our beloved Sammy in a purple blanket and she even gave us a hug knowing how much it hurt us. She will forever be a person we will recommend for anyone who has to go through this heartbreaking event.

I knew I wanted her to be the one to take care of our sweet Rocky. She is amazing! Kind, compassionate and took excellent care of our dog and my family.

When Dr Perzak came and sat with her she crawled up on her lap and put her head in her hand. She knew she was to be trusted and that she was there to help her. And she did. We appreciate this service in the home. It was so much easier on sweet Lilith Anne who as a rescue dog has always been terribied of going to the vets office. Thank you!

> Hey, tough bitter sweet post. Bailey was our first baby and always will be. She was a core part of our safety and our daily life. When the hardest decision had to be made fortunately we found Dr. Perzak. To be honest we did not know what to expect or really wanted to make this decision. However we made the decision of our baby to pass on. This is where Dr. Perzak shined like a bright star in such a dark time. She made all of our final moments as sentiment and thoughtful as she could possibly do in her position. Dr. Perzak showed up to our house at late hours in the evening " scheduling availability" which allowed us to spend as much of our last momements with our baby. When she arrived it wasn't " just straight to business". She stayed put with us and embraced those last precious moments with our baby like it was her own. She was so heart felt and gentle through out this entire difficult hsrship in our life. I never wish this part of companionship with any owner but it's inevitable. However when that time does come, you should rest easy knowing there is a amazing Doctor out there who clearly is passionate about what she does and is loving and sincere when it comes to those momements. Can't express enough how grateful we are through out it all. Thank you again Dr. Perzak. Sincerely, The Shulers

> Words can't begin to convey how grateful that I am for the sincere care and concern Dr. Perzak provided to me and my wife as we made the incredibly difficult decision to assist our beloved, Remington (Remi), pass from this life to the next. She was extremely patient in explaining the entire process and could not have provided any better support and service to us in our most difficult time. The "gift" she provides with this in-home service allows the animal (and their caregivers) the comfort and dignity of having this transition happen in a comfortable surrounding. This made all the difference for us. There are angels on this earth and I am convinced that Dr. Perzak is one of them. I will never forget the compassion she showed to Remi...and to us. May God bless her and all those that are dealing with this difficult process and may we all be comforted in this time of loss.

> Dr. Perzak is kind, gentle, and understanding. It’s never easy deciding to say goodbye to a pet but having the ability to do it at home instead of in a vets office where your pet may feel uncomfortable is a blessing. Trigger loved Dr. Perzak when she was his primary vet and it was truly comforting for him to wag his tail and be excited to see her again before he left us. The follow up email providing resources was very helpful as well. This is an expensive service but I think it’s well worth the price.

> When my vet gently hinted that my furbaby did not have much time left, it was hard to swallow, but I knew that I needed to educate myself about how to keep him comfortable and how to give him the love he deserves. CodaPet was one of the options suggested, and as devastating as this has been for me, choosing this option has brought me some peace. I didn’t want my furbaby to be cold and scared and surrounded by unfamiliar smells and in pain. No. When the vet told me that it was time, we did it the right way. We were able to be home, filling him with love and attention and snuggles on his favorite beanbag. He wasn’t afraid or in pain. It was very gentle, and Dr. Perzak is an angel.

> I would 100 % recommend Dr. Perzak and CodaPet. She was professional, kind and understanding of the fears and emotions of a pet parent. I texted several times between booking and final service and she was always available with warmth and knowledge. Letting an aging pet go is heavy on the heart but the process was as calm and peaceful as it could be. My 14 yr old lab crossed the rainbow bridge comfortably at home surrounded by his family to include two canine buddies. There was no difficult travel to the vet or associated anxiety. A heartfelt Thank You to Dr. Perzak,💜

> The kindness and compassion for our sweet Molly and our family Dr. Perzak shared made a very difficult time bearable. Fortunately we haven't had to go through this before and really were apprehensive and torn about the decision. Having Molly at home surrounded by her family and her furry siblings let us know without a doubt we had an angel with us in Dr Perzak. Thank you

> When I realized that it was time for my sweet Axle to cross the rainbow bridge I wanted to create a peaceful, calm setting in a familiar place surrounded by people and things he loved. I reached out to Coda Pet to schedule a consultation. Dr. Perzak was so helpful in explaining the process. She answered all of my many questions leading up to our appointment and even assisted me with moving up the initial appointment when Axle’s condition worsened. When she arrived at my home, we chatted and she examined my baby and loved on him as we spoke. She allowed me to tell her of our many adventures and special moments together over the past 15 years. She explained everything as she went along and there was never any rush. She gave us space and allowed all the time that we needed to say our goodbyes. Dr Perzak definitely has a gift for assisting pets and their families during this difficult time. I absolutely recommend in home euthanasia and Dr Perzak. She was amazing!

> Dr. Perzak was not only caring, but her professionalism gave us reassurance at an important time. Only today, two weeks later, as we were spreading our dear pet's ashes near a special hiking place, did we find his dog tags among the ashes, just as it should have been. Now we will put the tags with the remaining ashes in the most special location. Thank you, Dr. Perzak and the Codapet team for handling everything just right. It gave Blazethe proper end to a life of love and activity.
