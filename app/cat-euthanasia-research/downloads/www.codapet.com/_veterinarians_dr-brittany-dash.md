Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I am the classic animal-lover turned veterinarian. My love for animals comes from my mother, who always had pets in the home during my childhood. Now as a mom myself, I want to show my daughter how to have compassion and respect for animals. I believe that pets are so pure-hearted and loving that they deserve everything this world has to offer. I strive to do my part in providing care for all pets through every life stage. I also have a special interest in geriatric medicine, as older pets need extra attention, especially in their final days. I want to provide a space for families to have a peaceful and loving final good-bye to their cherished pets. As an in-home euthanasia veterinarian, I vow to make sure your pet's journey to the rainbow bridge is special and comfortable because our furry angels deserve nothing less than the very best.

> It seems odd to give a five-star rating to euthanasia because it's so sad, but it is for that reason that I give Dr Dash five stars. She came to the house and was comforting to both me and Louis. She was able to help me give Louis, my Newfoundland, a peaceful and easy passing. He was not scared nor stressed and I feel that is the least I could do for him. I highly recommend both Dr Dash and codapet. The online reservation system was efficient and easy to use and they kept you updated via text which made it easier to prepare. I called a couple other better known services in the area and they were a nightmare, making things worse in an already distressing situation. Do yourself and your pet a favor by going this route.

> Coda was wonderful and the procedure was easy to schedule. Dr. Dash lead the process with compassion and respect for my dog, Birdie, and me. She felt no pain and drifted off peacefully in my arms. I couldn't have asked for a better way to send her on her new journey.

> Dr. Brittany Dash was gentle, calming, compassionate. She provided a godsend of a service with the kindness and consideration called for by the occasion . She was puntual and pleasant. My beloved Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Jessica, was in pain physically and I was and am in pain emotionally. Dr. Brittany Dash responded to my request for a house call promptly and was able to accommodate us that same day at 8:30 in the evening in our home.

> Saying goodbye to Zoey was one of the hardest decisions I’ve ever had to make, but having the opportunity to let her pass peacefully at home was a gift I’ll always be grateful for. From the moment I reached out, Dr. Brittney Dash brought a level of compassion, professionalism, and care that helped ease the weight of such a heavy moment. Before the visit, Dr. Dash took the time to review Zoey’s medical records and history, ensuring she was informed and fully prepared. It wasn’t just a scheduled appointment—it felt like she truly saw Zoey and respected her journey. At no point did I feel rushed or pressured; everything was done gently, at our pace, with such a calm, grounding presence. The experience was incredibly intimate. Zoey was surrounded by love, familiar smells, and comfort, in the place she called home. It was exactly what I hoped for her—peace, dignity, and warmth in her final moments. I’ll never forget that day, and I’ll forever be thankful to Dr. Dash for helping guide us through it with grace.

> The doctor was very compassionate. For the whole family, it was a very difficult moment—the passing of our baby who gave us love for the last 15 years of her life. Trufa was like a daughter to all of us, but having her at home was a celebration of life, a memory that will stay with us forever.

> CodaPet was a godsend in a moment of deep despair, and our vet Dr. Brittney Dash was an angel. Anyone losing a pet knows how devastating the process is, and thinking of taking them to a vet and pass in an unknown place was not an option. Dr. Dash was kind, compassionate and patient with us throughout the whole process. She explained the whole procedure beforehand and administered the medicine with such care and grace, our precious baby boy went peacefully at home in our arms. The aftercare was handled either much care and respect. I appreciate this service for helping us through this difficult time and helping Baba cross over in comfort, and would 100% recommend to anyone needing help in this time.

> My furry companion of over sixteen and a half years crossed over the rainbow February 10th and although I knew it was coming, I didn't expect it that day. Dr. Brittany was so absolutely amazing. She was compassionate, patient, and so understanding. She explained every step of the process in advance and allowed me all of the time I needed with Yoshi to say my goodbye. I can't imagine going through this already difficult process with anyone else!

> Dr. Brittany Dash and CodaPet were amazing with my sweet English Black Labrador Madison. Brittany was so gentle and caring with Madison's journey across the rainbow bridge. Madison peacefully passed with loving family surrounding her. CodaPet delivered Madison's ashes with a sweet card and presentation. Thank you for all of your Love and support Dr. Brittany Dash.

> Our sweet kitty went downhill quickly after her diagnoses, and she let us know when it was time. Dr. Dash was able to come on a Sunday very quickly. She explained to us the entire process, what she was doing, what our cat might feel, what we should do with our dog, etc. She was so comforting and allowed us time to grieve alone with our kitty before they left together. Highly recommend for the best experience and low stress for your baby.

> Even searching for this service was heart-breaking for me. CodaPet was very timely in responding to my questions and helped me understand the service and the options. Dr. Brittany Dash was compassionate and professional in coordinating her appointment. She presented herself as a friend and took care of everything ensuring that my beloved Rosie's transition was peaceful. Her professionalism and empathy will not be forgotten. Having the option to be in the comfort of home with Rosie in her last moments is something that can not truly be expressed. I appreciate this service and would highly recommend it for anyone going through this. Thank you Dr. Dash for giving Rosie the comfort and allowing her to be surrounded by love from family and her fur-brother.
