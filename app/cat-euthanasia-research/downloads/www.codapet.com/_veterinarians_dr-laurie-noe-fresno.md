Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

From the time I could pronounce the word, I wanted to be a veterinarian (around 5 years old) and I never wavered from that goal. I have been a veterinarian for over 35 years and still love every minute of my profession. I never felt being a veterinarian was a career choice, but rather a calling. I have strived to provide the best care possible for my patients, with special attention to reducing their pain and suffering. To this end, I have many years providing home euthanasia for family pets. I have always felt profoundly honored to be chosen by a family to help their beloved pet pass from their suffering to a place where they are free. To do so in the comfort of their own home (or other special place) is so much more dignified and intimate for the patient and their family.

> Dr. Noe with CodaPet made saying goodbye to our sweet, beautful husky so peaceful. It makes a world of difference for your fur babies to feel safe and comfortable when they pass, and having her come to us did just that. She was also very respectful of our boy, allowed us to take as much time as we wanted with him, took some amazing paw prints and said some really beautiful words in his honor.

> For those only interested in a brief review, let me say that Dr. Noe and her assistant, Bill, were wonderful. The entire procedure could not have been smoother or more humane. I cannot recommend this service enough for when you have to say "goodbye". For those interested in greater detail, here goes. My cat, Seamus, was in terminal decline for the past 20 months lymphoma. His last days were grim and I want to think he let us know that he was ready the day of the procedure. Seamus always hated to go to the vet's office, so I researched in-home euthanasia options to see if it was feasible. Once I found the CodaPet website, it was very simple to schedule an appointment for when it was my buddy's time. Dr. Noe contacted me the afternoon before to go over the steps of the procedure and to answer a number of my questions and concerns. I felt very reassured by her answers. The next day, Dr. Noe and Bill arrived slightly early, which I greatly appreciate. Once inside the house, we went over the paperwork and she went through the proceedings again and explained how his remains would be returned to us. We chose to perform the euthanasia outside on our patio, where Seamus liked to lie in the sun. Dr. Noe did a brief exam before administering the sedative. Once the sedative had taken effect, we all went outside to say our "good byes". Dr. Noe and Bill were so kind and understanding- taking numerous paw prints and preserving some of Seamus' fur for us. They even waited for me to give a brief, but tearful eulogy. Then, with my Seamus in my arms, the doctor administered the drug and he passed as calmly and gently as could be. I then held him for a few more minutes while the Doctor and Bill retrieved a padded basket for my Seamus' remains. As hard as this day was, the relief we felt after it was done was tremendous. This is in no small part a result of the care, compassion, and professionalism of Dr. Noe and Bill. They made this procedure as good as I could have possibly hoped. I cannot recommend an in-home procedure enough for the animals you love. It is simply the best way to do a difficult, but necessary thing. You won't regret it.

> Being able to have this done at home was a huge relief since our dog hated going into the vet and we wanted her last moments to be as comfortable as possible for her. I'm glad Pebbles was able to be surrounded by her loved ones in the comfort of our home.

> Putting my beloved Avery down was the hardest day of my life. While there is no easy way to do that, Dr. Noe made the experience so much better. From the moment she came to my house, her calm presence put everyone at ease, including my dog. She was professional, yet spoke as if she had known Avery for years. She gave us as much time as we needed to say goodbye to our baby without feeling rushed. After Avery passed, Dr. Noe gave a heartfelt speech and hugged us all. I couldn't imagine having to euthanize in any other way.

> Dr Noe was very professional and thoughtful. She helped us with our 19 year old little dog. She made a little paw print for us to keep. She explained everything, asked if we needed a little extra time and let me hold my girl as she passed. I am very happy that we used this service. Dr Noe was caring and understanding in this situation.

> I am incredibly grateful for the compassion and care Dr. Noe showed during one of the hardest moments of my life. They came to my home to help peacefully put my dog to rest, and the kindness they brought with them made an unbearable situation just a little easier. They were gentle, patient, and respectful with both my dog and my family. They explained everything clearly, never rushed us, and gave us all the time we needed to say goodbye. My dog was calm and comfortable, surrounded by love, and I’ll always be thankful for that. It takes a special kind of person to do what they do, and they handled it with genuine empathy. I recommend Dr. Noe to everyone!

> This was my first experience with in-home pet euthanasia. A neighbor recommended CodaPet when we needed help with our failing dog. Dr. Noe was so respectful and compassionate, but most importantly, Smokey was relaxed throughout the entire experience. Our final moments together were filled with love and peace as he gently faded away in my arms while lying on his favorite blanket. Dr. Noe was so kind, and I felt so supported by her knowledge and understanding of the situation. CodaPet was absolutely the right choice for Smokey, and I would highly recommend Dr. Noe for her wonderful care and compassion. It made a world of difference when facing such a difficult situation.
