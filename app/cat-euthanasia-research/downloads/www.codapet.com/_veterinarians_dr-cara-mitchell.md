Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I became a veterinarian because I believe it is our responsibility as humans to care for animals who don't have a voice or much of a choice in their lives. Whether it's a wild animal, a farm animal, or a pet, we humans impact their environment and what happens to them. My mission is to make every animal I care for feel loved and safe in any situation. Throughout my career, I have had to euthanize many animals, which is never an easy thing to do. During this difficult task, I have developed a way to focus all my love and attention on the life of the animal, not the euthanasia. So that in this challenging situation, the animal feels safe and loved during this peaceful passing, and the owners feel at peace with the decision that has been made.

> Cara was such an incredible blessing to our family. Our 16 year old border collie lab mix Dorothy was ready to transition and Cara facilitated such a loving and respectful passing. The fact that she came to our home made such a difference! Dorothy could be surrounded by those who loved her in a setting she felt safe and familiar in. Cara couldn’t have been more kind, patient and capable. Thank you forever for making this painful day a beautiful day as well.

> Dr Mitchell Could not have been better. Gentle, patient, compassionate, thorough. My baby did not suffer any anxiety whatsoever and had the most peaceful passing. So much better than the traditional animal hospital euthanasia. Worth every penny of the fee. Will highly recommend to friends & coworkers that may need her service.

> This is one review I wish I never had to leave, as it means the loss of my precious Koda. Cara was so professional and compassionate from start to finish. She made a very sad and painful process go as smoothly and as peacefully as it possibly could. She took care of everything and went above and beyond. If I had to do this again, there isn’t another vet I would want to be there to help my pet pass. Thank you, Cara.

> They are not enough words to express how thankful I am for Dr.Cara and her in home services. She was so compassionate and professional during such a heard time for us. Our sweet boy was 15+ years old and I'm thankful he was able to be in the comfort of his own home. I feel for anyone having to make the decision but I couldn't recommend Dr.Cara Mitchell enough.

> I would recommend Dr. Mitchell and CodaPet to every single pet parent. Having the option for professional care at home is priceless. While letting any pet go is one of the saddest and hardest decisions, it was an easy decision to use CodaPet so my cat could stay at home in her safe space and in my arms until the very end. Dr. Mitchell was so very gentle and sweet to my cat and comforting to me as well during such a difficult time. Highly highly recommend.

> Dr Cara Mitchell was so compassionate and thoughtful as we had to make the difficult decision for our Maltese as the Cushings Disease had taken its toll on her body. The at home service helped our Mazie be as comfortable as possible in her last moments as Dr Cara explained everything ahead of time to let us know what each step would be. Thank you Dr Cara Mitchell.

> I was devastated when I came to the realization that my Mazie girl was so sick that she wasn’t going to get better. I dreaded the final moments of her life ending in a place she hated to go. Thank goodness a friend reached out to me about Dr. Cara Mitchell! Dr. Mitchell came to the house where Mazie would take her final journey. Mazie was at ease (as much as possible). Dr . Mitchell explained step by step what was going to happen. Dr. Mitchells hugs and tears along with mine told me all I needed to know about her! I would highly recommend Cara Mitchell if you are facing the heart wrenching decision to put your fur baby to sleep. Dr. Mitchell is so patient, caring and understanding not to rush you with the final goodbye to your precious fur baby.

> I was lucky enough to find DR. Cara Mitchell to assist with the passing of my sweet beautiful Daisy (my almost 12 year old Englishbulldog). Daisy got to pass away so peaceful in her bed at her home with the people who loved her. DR. Mitchell went beyond what I expected to make this a easy process for all of us. She is absolutely wonderful. I would recommend her to anyone going through this painful decision. I thank God for such a caring wonderful person. RIP Daisy 🩷

> This is not something that anyone ever wants to go through but if you must, Cara is a wonderful guide and provider. I had to go through this alone due to the holidays but felt like none of that mattered thanks to the compassion and warmth that Cara provided as she helped my Lucy pass peacefully. She was communicative, punctual, extremely professional, explained things in an easy to understand manner and most of all just such a calming and peaceful presence for my pet and my (admittedly in shambles) self.

> Cara was incredible at her job and full of peace and compassion. Just a few hours ago we had to say goodbye to a family friend’s dog. I was sad and nervous as to how the experience would go. We could not have had a better professional, kind hearted, empathetic person to help us with such a hard day. Cara was very communicative and talked us through the whole process. Our sweet dog we said goodbye to was completely at peace and serene through the whole experience. He had a history of being afraid of strangers and being aggressive but it’s as if he knew Cara was only there to help him and offer him peace and kindness. He instantly became friends with her. The whole process made me feel at peace and very cared for as well. I would highly recommend her to anyone who needs at home euthanasia.

> I will be forever thankful for Dr Cara and her in home euthanasia service. We just recently found out our sweet boy Luke had a mass on his heart. He was terribly ill and weak and pursuing any type of treatment would be too traumatizing for him. We felt helping him go peacefully was giving him back all the love he gave to us. Dr Cara coming to our home made it possible for us. She is very caring and compassionate. There was no rushing and Dr Cara did everything she could to keep Luke from feeling stressed. What a gift to be able to send Luke off knowing he felt safe, comfortable and loved.

> Let’s be honest- no one wants to make an appointment for this kind of service- however, it’s a part of life for pet owners. Dr. Cara was wonderful and supportive throughout the entire process. From communicating beforehand to learn more about my situation to the visit and aftercare, each step of the way she was caring. I’m sorry you’ll need this service, but if you do, I’d recommend Dr. Cara.
