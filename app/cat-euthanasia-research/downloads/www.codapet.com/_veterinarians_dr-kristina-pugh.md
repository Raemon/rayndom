Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

Our pets provide us so much joy and happiness, that we can't ever truly be ready to say goodbye. After participating in euthanasia's in a clinic setting for 15 years, I'm relieved to be able to provide a more relaxing, peaceful, and personal alternative to pets and their families.

> We cannot thank Dr Kristina Pugh enough for the compassion and professionalism she showed during one of the hardest moments of our lives. When we had to say goodbye to our beloved Sunny, her gentle approach, genuine care and understanding made an incredibly difficult situation bearable. Dr Pugh handled everything with such kindness, explaining the whole process clearly and treating Sunny with dignity and respect. We are forever grateful for the empathy and professionalism she showed us.

> As difficult as this choice may be, choosing Dr Pugh to facilitate the process was easy. She came with amazing referrals and was absolutely wonderful. Everyone knows the pain, deep pain of making this decision. With Kristina leading us through the process, we were able to focus on sharing quality time with Dennis, my cat. I’ll always be grateful for that.

> Dr. Pugh was so compassionate and kind. She hugged our dog Sammy as if he was her own. If he had any idea she was a vet, he would have been extremely anxious. Instead, he thought she was an instant friend. She explained every step to us and treated Sammy with such care. We cannot thank her enough for helping us during such a difficult time.

> Having Dr Pugh come to my house to put my 16 year old standard poodle to sleep was such a positive experience and I am so lucky to have discovered her instead of going to a cold Vets office. She was extremely professional and very sympathetic to what me and my family were going through. I highly recommend her ! She created a warm and loving environment in the confines of my home for the final send off to my best Friend Coal.

> After an amazing 14 year journey with the kindest German Shepherd that ever lived, we made the impossible decision to allow Jakob to continue his journey without us. Contacting Dr. Pugh and scheduling an in home pet euthanasia was a monumental decision in our lives with Jakob. Thank you Dr. Pugh. You made our heartbreak a wee bit better. He was indeed a Good Boy.

> Dr. Kristina Pugh, the Vet from CodaPet, was very kind in helping us with in-home pet euthanasia for our 16 year old kitty, Josie. She was warm, thoughtful and easy going. She helped us understand the process and helped us to help our other pets see the kitty after she passed away so they knew she was gone. It is such a difficult decision to make, but Dr. Pugh made it more comfortable.

> DR Kristina is amazing, we have had a few at home services and by far we felt the most connected to her and her compassionate ways. DR K was thorough and respectful at the same time. She gave us all the steps that she would be taking as Jake was set free. She was so gentle and the procedure went smoothly and without any complications. I would highly recommend DR Kristina Pugh to anyones pets that need end of life services. Thank you doesn’t seem to be enough.

> As gut-wrenching as it is to lose a pet, making the arrangements and the final appointment were stress-free. When Dr. Pugh arrived at our home, she took her shoes off, put her bag on the coffee table, then got down on the floor with Raven (our 14 year old dog) to get to know her a bit. Dr. Pugh was soft-spoken while keeping us informed ... choosing her words wisely and precisely. Once Raven was at peace, I was able to assist Dr. Pugh in getting Raven to the car. You know when the time has come. Don't second-guess yourself, go online with CodaPet. Maybe you'll be lucky enough to get Dr. Kristina Pugh!

> Dr. Kristina Pugh is honestly the sweetest person EVER! I will never be able to thank her enough for how kind she was to our family and especially our Harley. I never knew about someone coming to the house. I didn’t know how it was going to go. Our sweet dog got to pass in his home, comfortable. Our whole family, who were all an absolute wreck, thought she was perfect. I can’t say enough about her. It’s a difficult time and she made everything easier. Thank you so much for that, Dr. Pugh!

> We used the at home euthanasia services of Dr. Kristina Pugh for our cat Cricket. I am very thankful for the comfort she was able to provide us. The process was very smooth and professional in the comfort of our own home. Dr. Kristina provided a paw print for keepsake and helped us with after care arrangements. The peaceful, radiant vibe of Dr. Kristina is exactly what I want if I ever have to use at home euthanasia services. If the time comes when I have to do this again I will surely contact Dr. Pugh.

> Our girl wasn’t great at car rides at the end of her life and was terrified of the vet. She would get so worked up and we just knew we didn’t want her last moments to be scary. So when the day came where her life wasn’t quality, we knew we wanted to have in-home euthanasia done. After contacting several local companies, we were relieved to find CodaPet and even more relieved to have Dr. Kristina be available within a few hours. She was an amazing comfort in such a sad time and explained everything. She loved on our girl before even sitting down, and complimented her over and over. When the time came, she was respectful, gave us time and space and listened as we told stories about our girl. It is slightly more expensive than the vets office, but it was 100% the right choice for our baby.

> Dr. Kristina Pugh came to us on one of our worst days when it was time to put our first beloved pet to sleep. We made our in-home pet euthanasia appointment the day before and from the time of booking, Dr. Kristina was empathetic and responsive and let us know we could chat about quality of life or a more urgent appointment if needed. Dr. Kristina arrived and greeted our dogs, talked us through the process, offered helpful words of comfort and encouragement, and gave us space and time to say our tearful goodbyes. She was caring and compassionate on a very sad and personal day for us. We didn't know exactly what to expect, but we couldn't have asked for a better experience all things considered. Our Molly girl passed peacefully in our arms and she is now at rest. Thank you to Dr. Kristina for making a difficult day just a little bit easier.

> Dr. Kristina Pugh helped us say goodbye to our beloved cat, Rodney, with so much compassion and grace. She enabled us to have beautiful last moments together, making sure he was comfortable and surrounded by love. She gave us as much time as we needed, answered all of our questions, and explained what to expect before anything happened, which made the process gentler and less overwhelming. After days of watching him struggle in pain, it was such a relief to see him at peace. Dr. Pugh went out of her way to call the cemetery ahead of our arrival to make a special request on our behalf. We didn't know she had done that until we showed up there. It was a beautiful surprise. She was so professional, kind, and gentle, guiding our cat smoothly to the other side. I will be forever grateful that she gave him such a peaceful and dignified passing, and gave us the comfort of knowing he left this world loved and at ease.

> Dr. Kristina was absolutely incredible. We needed to say goodbye to our handsome boy of 18 years, and it was honestly the hardest day of my life. We wanted to do it at home to make things easy on him and us. Dr. Kristina was compassionate, caring, and handled our cat's needs as though he were her own. Her bedside was amazing, and she explained every step of the way to us so we knew what to expect and how he would be feeling. She even gave us time to let the other 2 cats say goodbye. Well worth every penny for the visit, she is an incredible vet and human <3

> Our baby had the most honorable discharge — not only peaceful but deeply spiritual. I did not know what to expect, but the experience was comforting from beginning to end. Dr. Pugh guided us with her nonjudgmental ear, insightful wisdom, personal stories about her own mother, and a research-based guidance tool that put us at ease. I never valued quantitative data-collecting methods, such as the QOL survey, as much as I do now. We were grateful she shared this tool with us, because it allowed us to see the future clearly. As Dr. Pugh reminded us, “better to be a week early than a day late.” We are so thankful that she was our doctor — her compassion, clarity, and hugs made all the difference in one of the most difficult moments of our lives. From our ChatGPT deep dive on who to choose, she did not disappoint.
