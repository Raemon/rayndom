# The Community Impact of In-Home Pet Euthanasia

In-home pet euthanasia is a service provided by veterinarians who perform the procedure in the comfort and familiar surroundings of a pet’s home. This is often a preferred choice for families with an ailing or elderly pet. In-home euthanasia allows them to say goodbye to their pets in a peaceful and familiar environment, surrounded by family and friends.

In most communities, there are just a few independent home euthanasia veterinarians whose schedules book up fast. Veterinarians working full-time clinic jobs are typically not able to make home visits and those same veterinarians don’t have economic incentive from their clinic to work after hours or during off days. Despite a large pet parent demand for this in-home service, there is a dearth of in-home euthanasia veterinarian providers.

## **Supporting the Local Community**

A veterinarian offering in-home pet euthanasia services supports the local community in several ways. Some of these ways include:

### Providing a compassionate and convenient service

In-home euthanasia offers a compassionate and convenient way for pet owners to say goodbye to their pets. This service helps alleviate the stress and anxiety that pet owners may experience when they have to transport their ailing pets to a clinic or hospital.

### Offering emotional support to pet owners

Allowing families to have a private space while they are going through this difficult transition is beneficial to their grieving process; and the most comfortable and private space we can offer is their own home.

### Reducing the stress on the pet

In-home euthanasia minimizes the stress experienced by the pet, as it is performed in a familiar environment and usually negates the need to move them. This can help make the pet more comfortable and at ease during the procedure, ensuring a more peaceful and dignified end.

### Saving time and resources

In-home euthanasia can save time and resources for both the pet owner and the veterinary clinic. It eliminates the need for transportation and allows the family to spend more time with their pet during the final moments while ensuring more clinic resources are available for preventive care or sick appointments.

### Supporting local veterinary practices

Veterinarians who offer in-home euthanasia services are able to work in collaboration with local veterinary practices to support the client. Clinics can be sure their clients are given the time and space to grieve without needing to feel like they are rushing or like the environment is too boisterous. Clients are able to bring other pets to the clinic without feeling like they can’t walk past the room where the euthanasia occurred. This partnership helps support local veterinary businesses and ensures that the community has access to high-quality veterinary care.

**At CodaPet, our network of veterinarians is supporting and helping the local community by offering in-home pet euthanasia.** Our network of veterinarians choose to work full-time, part-time, or as gig work (a couple of appointments a week); setting their own hours and availability.
