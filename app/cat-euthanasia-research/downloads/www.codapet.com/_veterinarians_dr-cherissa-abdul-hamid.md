Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I became a vet because of my love for people; by caring and attending for pets, I am directly influencing that person's well-being. I started performing in-home euthanasia during the Pandemic as a way to extend veterinary reach to individuals and their pets that may not have had another option. Providing in- home-euthanasia for families who wish to keep their furry household member calm and at ease during their final moments is another way that I can support families during a difficult and intimate time.

> This was the first time having to say goodbye to a pet. My pup had declined quickly on Thanksgiving morning. I didn’t even know if there would be any options to do anything that day or if I’d have to wait until the next day to do anything. I am very thankful for Dr. Cherissa. She was very kind and compassionate. She explained what the process would look like and gave us plenty of time for our goodbyes. Thank you again for your service.

> Dr. Hamid was an extremely compassionate person. We were able to say our final goodbye’s at home in a very peaceful manner. Dr. Hamid answered all of our questions and allowed us to share our last minutes as a family. We’ll miss our baby girl and Dr. Hamid was the angel sent to take her home. Thank you for the love and comfort in such a sad time…

> Making the decision to end our beloved Cabbage's suffering was one of the hardest decisions we had to make as a family. She was only 6 years old and had been fighting advanced kidney disease for about 6 months. We had scheduled euthanasia with our vet for Monday morning. On Saturday, our sweet girl was in so much pain we knew that it could not wait until Monday morning. I called Coda and Dr. Hamid was able to come to our home within a few hours. Her calming presence made the experience as easy as it could be under the circumstances. I highly recommend Coda and Dr. Hamid for anyone facing the loss of a pet. Allowing Cabbage to pass peacefully at home surrounded by her family was the best decision we could have made.

> Dr Hamid’s care of us, Xochi’s K9 sisters, and most importantly of Xochi was exceptional. She came to our home and spent quality time with us. She did a complete assessment of Xochi. Her advanced age and associated health challenges were just too much for our Sweet Xochi to have to endure any more. Then when we were all ready, she helped our Xochi with the most peaceful, compassionate “passing on” that I have ever witnessed (K9 or human). I am a retired nurse and lover of rescued K9’s all my life, so I have witnessed many. I felt that the hug she gave us after it was all over was truly a genuine one. In summary, Dr Hamid was an Angel of Mercy for Xochi and our family. I would highly recommend her care to everyone.

> This was our first experience with at home pet euthanasia and we are so happy that it was recommended to us. Our sweet boy Kuma, became terrified of the vet in his later years but this option enabled him to be totally at ease for the whole process. As heartbreaking as it is to lose him we are so grateful we could offer him the comfort of his favorite spot in the yard surrounded by all his familiar smells and people. Dr. Abdul was wonderful and understanding in every way, we were glad to have her help through this process.

> Dr. Abdul is a very kind, caring, and understanding veterinarian. She treated our family with respect and gave us comfort that our pet’s last few moments would be easy for him. Dr. Abdul was able to calmly explain the procedure and review and confirm our after-procedure requests. She gave our pet the quiet, at-home passing he deserved. We also appreciate Dr. Abdul’s choice of Emerson’s Pet Crematorium as they were also very kind and thoughtful.
