> We are very satisfied with our CodaPet experience. Dr. Phillips was a godsend, providing the perfect solution to an agonizing situation. Our 14 year old Lab Pacey was afforded a dignified, peaceful passing at his spot in the kitchen (where he was always happily underfoot) without a moment's distress or pain. It's the hardest decision a dog's family ever makes, but we never doubted that it was the right one at the right time. We will be forever grateful for Dr. Phillips" gentle kindness. We'll see you on the other side, dear old Pacey. Such a good, good boy.

> How do you say a final goodbye to your family furbaby? Absolutely dreading having to make ‘that’ decision. Being referred to Dr. Diana Phillips was a Godsend. Dr. Phillips guided our family gently and patiently, answering all questions of the ‘at- home’ euthanasia process by putting our minds at ease and our emotions safely without doubts. Her soothing and compassionate nature made it incredibly peaceful for our family to surround our Lab, telling him past stories and assuring him it was alright to gain his wings. We are so grateful to have experienced such a peaceful passing. Thank you Dr. Phillips

She lovingly made a cast print of her paw and presented it to me. She made a difficult time better with her mindful presence and her expertise. Forever grateful ❤️

> On one of the worst days, Dr. Phillips was gentle, caring reassuring. My Cole was my best friend and gave me unwavering love and devotion. Dr. Phillips helped me help my darling Cole be released from pain with the upmost compassion. Cole and I will meet at the Rainbow Bridge and continue our outings that we lived so much. Thank you so very much,Dr. Phillips.

> Dr. Diana Phillips was so amazing during this process of in home pet euthanasia. We wanted to give our 13 year old doberman the most stress free, humane, and respectful last moments. We wanted to do this at home so that all four of us in our family as well as our other doberman were all able to say goodbye. We wanted our girl to be able to have the comfort of her own home as well as her own dog bed. We didn't want a sterile environment or strange smells to be her last moments. Dr. Phillips was professional, kind, caring and so gentle. She told us exactly what to expect before the process began and answered all of our questions. We were able to say goodbye to our girl with dignity and Dr. Phillips supported us the whole way through the experience. She didn't rush us but let us say goodbye in our way. Highly recommend Dr. Phillips during this very difficult time when it is time to say goodbye.

> Dr. Phillips was much more that someone there to perform a task and be on her way. First she was an awesome care giver to our dog Riley who was suffering with cancer. Dr. Phillips care extended way beyond Riley and included our entire family that had gathered for Riley's passing. Dr. Phillips professionalism was surpassed only by her compassion for all who were there. Thank You Dr. Phillips for being there for Riley and us. Rock & Dana

> Losing a pet is never easy, but the ability to end your pets life peacefully at home is a savior. In the past I have always brought my dog to the vet, and it’s not something I ever will do again. Dr. Diana Phillips is a wonderful person. She understands this is a difficult time for both the pet and their owner. She genuinely cares. I was able to say goodbye to my girl Lucy in the comfort of my home, and she was treated lovingly and gracefully.

> We did not know you could do euthanasia at home until my daughter told me. Jack loved being outside even though he was an inside dog. He had cancer for 2 years and let us know he was ready when he stayed outside day and night for the last 3 days of his life. Diana let us all sit is the front yard, and he passed away very peacefully. Much better than going to the vet, which most animals don't like anyway.

> Diana was caring and took her time to explain the process to me. She is one of the most amazing human beings I have ever dealt with. She put Da Beats (our pup) in a soft bed for the ride home after the process. She explained that she talks to the pup as she drives to still give all the positive energy she can even though our Sweetie Beats had moved on to her next healthy life. Diana allowed our other dogs time to sniff the Sweetie Beats as a rite of passage for all. She made this experience peaceful. We are forever grateful. It was a stress free process for me and our other dogs. Thank you Diana and the whole staff for being so kind!

> Dr Phillips was amazing. Our Layla went down quickly over a weekend, and we couldn’t find anyone to come help give her rest until later in the week (which would have been terrible as Layla was already scared and unable to move much). Dr Phillips went out of her way on a Sunday evening, and drove over an hr (when she was not even on call), to come and help our sweet old girl. Dr Phillips was such a blessing! She explained everything in as little or as much detail as we wanted, and showed our dear pet of nearly a decade and a half, so much compassion. If ever you find yourself in the sad predicament of needing help saying goodbye to a beloved pet, Dr Phillips is who you should get in touch with ❤️

> She was very business like - and talked a lot of small talk through the agonizing process . I do not recall her ever saying she was sorry for my loss . And she caught my dog off guard with the first sedative and he screamed at the top of his lungs (he never did that with needles ) that was the last thing I remember him doing - then he wen out . Sad last memory . I appreciate what these vets do, but if your empathy is gone , it’s time for evaluation . This was the hardest thing I have ever done . Coda pets charged me 50.00 for her to shave a spot on his tail and give it to me . I will be leaving a public review soon .

> Diana was very gentle and very compassionate during the whole process. She explained every step to us. I hope we’ll have Chewy with us for much longer, but will use Diana again when it’s his time. She even explained to us how Chewy would react and she was spot on! It wasn’t a bad experience since we knew Misty was suffering.

> This vet was the most compassionate, understanding & had the patience of a saint. Her personal touches, like arranging our little girl in a small bed with blanket made her look like she was sleeping. She even allowed me to put a black eye Susan in her hair when she left our home. Having your pet put down in the home, if you ever have to do it is the most wonderful way to say goodbye. I want to work for CodaPet. Everyone has you and your pet first!!!!

> I am a retired Hospice nurse. It was most important to me that my loving companion Daisey have a peaceful passing at home with me by her side. Dr. Diana Phillips was so supportive and an absolute blessing at such a difficult time. She compassionately walked me through the process each step of the way. Daisey indeed passed without discomfort or fear. I am forever grateful for this program. I very much appreciated the time she took and obtained a beauty keepsake of Daisey’s paw print. 🌈❤️

Dr. Phillips was absolutely amazing, she took her time and answered all our questions and never rushed us with Mabel. This does cost a little more but it’s worth every penny! I’m sorry that I didn’t know about this service sooner. Doing this at home, I feel more at peace with our baby passing. Thank you Dr. Phillips💖❤️‍🩹 we love and miss you Ms. Mabel💝🐶
