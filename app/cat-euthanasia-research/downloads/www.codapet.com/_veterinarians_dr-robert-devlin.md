Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I became a veterinarian, like most, because I had a strong compassion for animals and wanted to help them live longer healthier lives. Unfortunately, our pets never live as long as we would like, and I see home euthanasia as providing both the pet parents and the beloved pet with a peaceful and loving location to say our final goodbye.

> There's no way to make this process truly easy. But Dr. Devlin made it as easy as it could be. He treated us and Ruskin with dignity, empathy, and compassion. Being able to do this at home helped lower the anxiety on all of us.

> Dr. Devlin was very patient and compassionate helping me and my family say goodbye to my sweet Gabriel. He allowed me plenty of time to spend with Gabriel both before and after euthanasia and explained the process fully. He was easy to reach with further questions I had regarding receiving his ashes. I would recommend him to anyone who is facing the loss of a pet.

> To say our dog Lucy was just “our dog” is a gross understatement—she was family. Dr. Rob was truly wonderful to Lucy and to our entire family. He helped gently guide us through her passing with compassion and sensitivity, and he affirmed our incredibly difficult decision to help Lucy in her time of need. Thank you, Dr. Rob.

> Dr. Rob was so understanding. Having never gone through anything like this before. He took his time to explain everything. Never rushed us would take time for us to be alone with Brandon. Couldn't have asked for a more compassionate vet.

> This is a late response, but Dr. Devlin was amazing. The hardest thing emotionally is having to decide and put your fur baby done. He was very kind and caring. You could tell it wasn't just his job. He was very skilled and professional.

> Dr. Devlin was exactly what we were looking for when it came time to make this gut-wrenching decision. He was kind, compassionate, and gave the process all the time required for her transition to be gentle and peaceful. We can't recommend his services enough. The Eastman Family

> Although it was a very difficult decision to make, Dr. Rob told us exactly what we needed to hear with great honesty and, above all, with great respect. I am very grateful to him for his compassion and kindness. I wouldn't hesitate to contact him again in the future, because, although it's very difficult to accept, death is a part of life.

> My best friend and constant companion had to cross the Rainbow Bridge. You never want that day to come, but when it does it is so nice to have Dr. Rob by your side. My Luna never takes to new people, or people other than me actually, but Dr. Rob made her comfortable before her journey. Made me comfortable, too. Not easy in either case! But, handled with ease by Dr. Rob. The journey itself was handled with great care and compassion. No pain. Just a gentle sleep and a final good bye. I could not ask for a better experience on such a day. Thank you, from both Luna and I, Dr, Rob.

> Dr. Devlin was very gentle and gave a thorough explanation of what to expect during the process. We could not get Grace to our vet but our experience with inhome euthanasia was awesome. Grace passed in the comfort of her bed and she left us very peacefully. Thank you Dr. Devlin, you are a very caring Vet.

> Dr Devlin came out to our home to assist with our baby boy, as we wanted him to be in a place he was familiar with to make it easier on both him and us. Dr. Devlin made Tadashi’s departure peaceful and painless. My son insisted on sitting with Tadashi until the end and Dr Devlin treated him as if he was the adult in the room. Walking him through every step. He made a very difficult time just the slightest easier. We all love our animals and it’s a crime of nature that their lifespans are so incredibly short. But if you’re ever in the need, I highly recommend him.

> Dr. Devlin made this extremely difficult experience as best as it could be. Losing our sweet Riley was so hard but Dr. Devlin was very empathetic and explained everything throughly. He was very kind, understanding, and supportive. We are very grateful that we were able to stay at home for this, where our boy was as comfortable as he could be. If you ever need at-home euthanasia for your pet, I highly recommend Dr. Devlin.

> We sadly had to put down our dog Chance who was with us for 16 years. Dr Devlin approached the entire heartbreaking process with compassion and respect. He was very gentle and explained everything from start to finish so we knew what to expect. Although we met under an unfortunate situation we are very thankful for him. He is a very kind soul.

> I highly recommend CodaPet! Ibooked everything online and even changed my appointment day and time with the calendar booking system. Dr. Devlin was very professional and kind. Having to euthanize a pet is never easy, going through the process with your pet at home is so much more peaceful than at the vet's office. You can also coordinate cremation if you wish.
