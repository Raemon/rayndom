Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I have a loving respect for all of Gods creations. After 25 years of stress filled pet emergency work and experiencing the grief and heartbreak that pet lovers go through on a daily basis one can't help but ponder life and death. These experiences, in part, lead me to practice yoga and meditation for over 30 years, which, at their essence are preparation for the transition from this life to something that we really can't explain.

> M y prayers for my sweet aging pup Trixie always included a request that God continue to grant her a peaceful life and when the time came a perfect end. Dr. Bruker’s compassion for animals and their owners, and respect for the moment at hand was evident from the instant he arrived at our home, knelled down on the floor to Trixie, and quickly befriended her. His process was unobtrusive and gentle and gave us time to love her, assure her, and say goodbye to her. She passed calmly and peacefully. Thank you Dr. Bruker for respectfully and compassionately bringing Trixie’s long life to that perfect end.
