Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

When I was 5 years old, I believed that I came up with the wonderful new idea of becoming a doctor for animals. My father gently explained that the concept had already been invented, but I could be the best vet there ever was! My role model growing up was James Herriot. I read every book he wrote at least three times, and by the time I got to high school, I was ready to help every animal in the world. Where other kids were getting the titles of Most Likely to Succeed, or Most Likely to Get Rich, I was voted as Most Likely to Become a Veterinarian. In my senior year of high school, I was selected into Mississippi State University's Early Entry Program which allowed me to complete by basic prerequisite courses and enter directly into Vet School. I graduated in 1997 and have been helping pets and their families ever since.

## What pet parents are saying

> Dr. White was incredibly kind and compassionate. She made sure that both we (the humans) and Benny (the pet) were as comfortable as possible. Her kindness and empathy helped to put us at ease and make an impossible situation a little bit easier.

> My family and I made one of the biggest decisions.. and that was letting our sweet Nola cross the rainbow bridge. When I contacted Coda Pets to ask some questions that I had, the amazing lady that answered the phone took her time. I didn’t feel rushed and I could tell she genuinely cared. When it was time for our scheduled appointment, Dr. Heather showed up with a warm presence. I was afraid she was going to hop in, insert the euthanasia, and leave. She did just the opposite. She allowed my family to grieve on our own time and allowed us to move through the process on our time. She walked us through the steps and showed true compassion during one of the hardest times that my family has ever gone through. I am truly appreciative of Dr. Heather and Coda Pets for showing so much compassion and love during such a hard time!

> I recently had the privilege of booking Dr. Heather White through CodaPet for in-home euthanasia services, and I cannot express enough gratitude for the experience. From the very beginning, Dr. White demonstrated extraordinary compassion and understanding during what was an incredibly difficult time for me. She approached the process with patience and sensitivity, ensuring my dog was never placed in an uncomfortable position or situation. Dr. White administered a "happy" medication that allowed my dog to relax and become comfortably sleepy. This gave him the chance to rest in my lap as I gently stroked his head and body, telling him how much he meant to me and what a wonderful companion he had been. Throughout the entire process, I never felt rushed or pressured. Instead, Dr. White created a calm and peaceful environment, which brought a sense of comfort despite the gravity of the moment. I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. White to anyone facing a similar situation. Her professionalism, kindness, and care make an otherwise heart-wrenching experience as gentle and comforting as possible. I wish you and your beloved pet the same level of compassion and support that I experienced.

> Dr. White is one of the kindest, most knowledgeable veterinarians in west Tennessee. My sweet boston terrier, Lillie Lou, does not really like new people. She did not resist when Dr. White pulled her into her arms. I thank Dr. White for all she did for me and my family. Highly recommend.

> I unfortunately had to have my sweet corgi put to sleep due to sudden, unexpected health issues. She was hospitalized at the vet for 2 days, and I couldn’t bare the thought of her not being able to be home for one last night and day. I was able to make an appointment with Dr. Heather on Friday afternoon when Abby was released from the vet to have her peaceful put to rest at home the next day. It was a true blessing at such a horrible time to have the option to have Abby at home where she was comfortable in a familiar environment. Dr. Heather was kind and thoughtful throughout the entire visit. She spoke to my Abby with love and you could tell you genuinely cared. I would highly recommend Dr Heather and Coda Pet to anyone faced with this decision.

> Our dog, Sissy, had been with our family since before our kids. We adopted her a month after we bought our house almost 9 years ago. Dr. White was incredibly caring, gentle and helpful by visiting us when it was time for Sissy to cross the rainbow bridge. I hated the idea of Sissy having to go to the vet for the end of her life, so her getting to sit at home, be in her favorite spot, and get her favorite snack before she left this world. I highly recommend Dr. White!

> Dr. White came the same day I contacted her and she was amazing. She was very compassionate, knowledgeable, and patient with my questions. She noticed my daughter wasn’t handling the situation well and offered to put some of our sweet kitty’s fur in a little keepsake bottle. That meant so much to us both. Given the circumstances, I couldn’t have asked for a better experience.

> I couldn’t have asked for a more empathetic and kind veterinarian to help my seventeen year old cat make his final journey. Dr. Heather White was able to visit us the same day we called for help. It was gentle and peaceful and such a relief to know that my Kitty was no longer in any discomfort. Hearing him snoring away once Dr. White administered the initial sedative was a tremendous blessing. He could finally rest. You’ll know in your bones when it’s time to call, even if you don’t want it to be, and when it is time, CodaPet will help you and your pet through it.

> Dr. White was so amazing during this difficult time. Her empathy and sympathy were crucial in helping us through this. Our Loki (who normally didn’t care for people) was so comfortable around her. She made his last moments peaceful and relaxing. She is an amazing woman and the people and pets she helps are lucky to have her.

> When I knew I was going to have to euthanize my 10 1/2 year old German Shepherd, Major, I was comforted when I heard that a vet could come to my house. This was the way I wanted him to die. I wanted him at home, with the fireplace on, laying in his bed, with his family beside him. Dr Heather White was the most compassionate, and caring vet. She had such a soothing vibe. She comforted me, assuring me that I made the right decision and that the timing was right. She got down on the floor beside him, stroking him while he took his last breaths. It felt like a she was a doula helping ease him out of this world, guiding us through this difficult decision. I am so grateful that this is my last memory of him, telling him how much I loved him, no panic, no stress, just a loving setting where we said our good byes.

> After the rapid decline of our beloved dog Bailey - we felt it was time to say our goodbye. I found Codapet and Dr. Heather, the process was easy and all online. Dr. Heather showed up on time and make sure we were comfortable with every step in the process, she was kind and compassionate. It made what was an unbearable situation better than I had imagined. Saying goodbye to a pet is never easy but this service made it much easier. Thank you for the opportunity to share my feelings. RIP Bailey Gene

> Dr. White was so compassionate and empathetic to our family. Our dog was always nervous around strangers, so we were so worried his final moments would be ful of stress and anxiety. She took the time to talk to us about what she needed to do. And she was so gentle, professional and careful, I don't even think Scooby knew she was there. He went to sleep calm and loved. Dr. White listened to some of our stories, and then gently got him loaded and took care of organizing his cremation. We are forever grateful for this service which allowed us all to say goodnbye in our own backyard. It was truly such a blessing and Dr. White was absolutely wonderful.

> It has been a week since we lost our baby. At home euthanasia was truly the best choice we could have ever made. Our Loki felt so comfortable around Dr. Heather White. He really didn’t care for a lot of people and that is a testament to Dr. White’s compassion. Again, we felt lost going in to this and it was one of the hardest things ever, but it could not have happened more perfectly and peacefully. We love you Loki forever!
