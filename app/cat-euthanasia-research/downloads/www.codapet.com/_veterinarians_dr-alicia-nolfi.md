Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

My lifelong passion for and commitment to family, animals, and humane treatment of all beings led to my career in veterinary medicine, which I am incredibly grateful for. Veterinary medicine is my calling. Upon proudly and humbly obtaining a veterinary medical degree, I served primarily in agricultural animal practice, specifically moving into advanced progressive equine podiatry practice. In addition but separate to this specialized practice, over the years, countless clients have sought my assistance with end-of-life care for both companion and agricultural animals, which allowed me to realize one of the greatest gifts veterinarians can give is to help animals experience as stress-free, compassionate and pain-free death as possible, and help people be at ease with their decision. In doing so, I have developed a profound appreciation for the honor of serving clients and patients in this capacity and I am now also offering this end-of-life focused care.

## What pet parents are saying

> Dr Nolfi is quite possibly rhe most amazing person I have encountered in my life. On what was one of the hardest days of my life, she came to me and my best buddy in the whole world and helped us both with his transition to the next life in the comfort of familiar surroundings while I held him and told him how much I loved him. Her compassion and obvious love for people and animals during this time and with follow up after the goodbye was more than I ever could have asked for. While I wish nobody ever had to do this, it is unfortunately a part of life, and the most loving thing you can ever do for your 4 legged friends. When the time comes, there is nobody else I could ever recommend more than Alicia Nolfi. She is quite possibly an angel in disguise

> It’s been a little over a month since our precious girl Shilo left us. And only now am I able to write about it without crying (too much). Our long time Vet had retired and we were at a loss as to who could come to the house. Our situation was urgent, and taking Shilo somewhere was not an option. After calling several practices and being told no one was available, Alpine Animal Hospital recommended Codapet. From the very first conversation, the people I spoke with were professional, organized and kind. I was told they had availability that same morning and that I would be contacted directly by the local veterinarian, Dr. Alicia Nolfi. I truly believe there was a reason why no one else was available. It was because we were meant to meet Alicia, so our girl could depart this world with the same dignity and grace with which she lived her life. From the moment Alicia arrived, she took the time to get to know us and listen to our Shilo stories. None of the process was rushed. She explained each step and gently guided us through it. And when Shilo was gone, she cried along with us. This was not our first at home euthanasia but it was by far the most tranquil and loving transition we have ever had. After allowing us some time to say our final goodbye, Alicia oh so carefully wrapped our darling girl in her blanket and with my husband carried her out to the truck for her last road trip. Taking care of the final arrangements made a heart breaking situation that much easier. Alicia is one of the most compassionate people I have ever met. She is undeniably an Angel sent here to do this very difficult work with the knowledge, tenderness and love only an Angel could possess. We were truly blessed to have her come into our lives just when we needed her the most, and for that we will be forever grateful. When the time comes that you must say goodbye to your furry friend, I can’t recommend Dr. Alicia highly enough. She is the greatest gift you can give to your cherished companion.

> If you find yourself in my situation this is definitely the way to go. My two previous 18-year-old feline euthanasia experiences at vet clinics were humane but clinical and expedited. When my 15-year-old Sophia’s kidney and thyroid issues progressed and she became too frail to continue, I remembered a local newspaper article about CodaPet. In this western Colorado resort area we are very fortunate to have a metro area service like CodaPet and an in-home veterinarian like Dr. Alicia Nolfi. Sophie spent most of her time in a cushy bed on my desk and I’m thankful that’s where she chose to settle in for the procedure. The effects of the first injection were incredible to watch as the pain meds and sedative soothed her into a blissful intoxication, probably the best she had felt in a long time. There were several minutes of alertness and eye contact prior to falling sound asleep in her bed. The subsequent injection of anesthetic was uneventful, and only after unconsciousness was confirmed were the fatal drugs administered. As painless as possible for Sophie and the saddened humans at her side. I had the ability to do an immediate burial on property. By adopting a senior shelter cat you know this day is coming way too soon, it’s part of life. Maybe another one someday, it’s good karma for both souls. Dr. Nolfi was professional and perfect start to finish, thank you again Alicia, I am truly grateful.

> When our cat came into our lives, as an adult, he was a promise to keep. When he left us, Kit-Kit had become a beloved member of our small family, and a person, at least, to us. He was already struggling with old age, vision and renal failure when his stroke happened at 16-17 yrs old. On short notice, on a Saturday, we able to find a recommendation for CodaPet, who connected us to Dr. Nolfi. When she arrived, on Monday morning, and met Kit-Kit we knew immediately we had made the best decision available to us. Our friend passed peacefully, painlessly, in his favorite spot, with my wife and I on either side of him. At all times Dr. Nolfi expressed care for our friend and acknowledged the personhood we saw in our pet. We felt her concern for us going through this process as well. Both my wife and I are deeply thankful to Dr. Alicia Nolfi, for her compassion, professionalism and willingness to come to our out of the way rural neighborhood. I would refer her service to anyone who has a pet in need, especially when that furry friend can't travel. We are thankful to the local vets who recommended that we reach out to CodaPet.

> She was a gift to us through a very sudden decline in health for our dog. She was tender and handled our sadness with great respect. She talked us through the process, so there was nothing that happened that we didn't understand. She had just helped us euthanize our horse a week and half earlier. It was a difficult few weeks and she was perfect during this very painful time in our lives. I highly recommend her.

> Dr. Nolfi was so incredibly compassionate and supportive. My family felt that we were being guided by an expert hand. She was sensitive to our feelings and desires, made absolutely sure my dog was comfortable and not stressed, and turned an otherwise devastating event into an experience that made me realize that euthanasia of our pets is really the best thing we can give them at the end of their lives. But more than that, I now believe that an in-home pet euthanasia is the best way to do it. In addition to the honorable and compassionate way Dr. Nolfi guided the process, she also said some things that completely shifted my perspective away from grief and sadness. She helped me understand her belief that animals don’t necessarily see death as tragic or sad, but that they see it as an expected part of the journey of life. This, and the absolute assurance that my dog was comfortable, calm, and unaware of anything wrong, has helped me deal with the grief in a much more positive way. Dr. Nolfi joined us in our tears after learning about my dog and his life, which showed me that she not only cares deeply for her patients (human and animal), but that her work in making the process as comfortable as possible is deeply personal. She was also kind enough to give my family some space when the procedure was finished, but honestly I would have been happy if she had stayed; that is how comfortable we all felt with her. If you need an absolute expert, a compassionate and caring vet, and someone who considers this tragic work important enough to dedicate herself to it full-time, please use Dr. Nolfi for your next in-home pet euthanasia. She is unequivocally the best.

> I am not a religious person but I do somehow think Dr. Alicia is an angel on earth. Her job must be incredibly taxing but she still showed up and exhibited genuine empathy, sympathy and kindness. She allowed us to take our time and gave us space to cry and mourn. She treated our sweet cat with dignity and respect and it felt like she loved her as much as we did. She is a beautiful and amazing human being.

She supported us through the entire process and went far above and beyond to care for us humans - and most importantly the care and concern she had for our princess dog was unsurpassed. She truly loves animals and has a genuine approach, making a very terrible situation bearable. We were so appreciative to have her support our family and will be forever grateful to her.

> Dr. Nolfi is truly phenomenal! We have never had to say goodbye to a pet in our own home but her compassion and professionalism made it as bearable as possible. She was incredibly kind to us and let us take the time we needed to say goodbye and process it all. The way she honored his passing was a beautiful experience. When the time comes again in the future, I hope we can leverage her guidance. Thank you Dr. Nolfi for being so great at what you do

> Dr. Alicia was like an angel who helped our family and our fur baby transition from this world. I have never met a vet who cared as much as Dr. Alicia, her communication was on point, she checked in with us before arriving, checked in afterwards to see how our broken hearts were holding up and then sent us a heartfelt note a few weeks later. She was professional, knowledgeable, thoughtful, kind, caring, compassionate, tender and helped us through a challenging time in a way I've never experienced from a vet. To lose a pet who's been part of your family is heart wrenching, but to have someone as kind and caring as Dr. Alicia makes it that much easier. I would highly recommend her, she's a gift to our community.
