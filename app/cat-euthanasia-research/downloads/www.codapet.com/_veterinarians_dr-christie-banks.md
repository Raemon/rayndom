## What pet parents are saying

> There are no words that can be said about how amazing Doctor Banks was in helping us through a very difficult decision. She was patient , kind and gentle. I have had my cat Token since I was 19 and 35 now have never had to put an animal to rest, having Christie there was honestly a blessing. Token, our cat, also was very comfortable and I truly believe it was the calming energy of Christie. Token was ready and we feel very blessed to have had Christie as our emotional support through the hard choices we had to make. Thank you again 100 times over. Your a saint & I know Token felt the same.

> Dr. Banks with CodaPet was absolutely amazing. We had to say goodbye to our 4 year old dog, Royal due to kidney failure. It was one of the hardest things we have ever done, but Dr. Banks made it easier. We originally had an appointment scheduled for a Saturday, but when Royal was rapidly declining, Dr. Banks was able to come on a Friday evening after her job. She really came through for us so we didn’t need to take him to an emergency vet. Royal was also a lot more nervous than we thought he would be. I had offered to muzzle Royal, but Dr. Banks was able to work through his nervousness. She was calm the whole time when he was awake, making sure he wasn’t getting more worked up. During and after sedation, Dr. Banks let us know exactly what she was doing and how it was going to work. We had time to say our goodbyes to Royal while he was sedated before the final injection. Once Royal was gone, Dr. Banks let me know. She was then able to get a few paw prints for me and let me get some fur. Dr. Banks was also able to transport Royal for private cremation. Overall, Dr. Banks made our final goodbye with Royal calm and comforting. We were outside on a perfect day in one of Royal’s favorite spots. Dr. Banks was comforting during and after everything as well. I highly recommend Dr. Banks with CodaPet.
