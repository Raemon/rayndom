# We strive to bring peace to all pets and their families.

Our pets are more than just animals, they are our companions, our support, and our family. They bring joy, compassion, and love into our lives, leaving a lasting impression on our hearts. Coda, meaning "tail" in Latin, refers to the final segment of a musical composition, dance or statement. At CodaPet, we believe that the connection we form with our pets is much like a coda, an extension to something that is already complete in and of itself.

CodaPet is dedicated to honoring that bond by celebrating the lives of the pets we cherish and providing resources, support, and love as they approach the end of their lives. We want to help them pass away peacefully, surrounded by the love and care they deserve.

## Bringing meaning to our pet’s final moments with compassionate end-of-life care

In a classical composition, the section of music that brings a piece to a close is called a coda. In every arrangement, the coda is unique, but its goal is universal: to bring the same meaning to the score’s final moments that its infatuating melody brought to the beginning, middle, and end.

At CodaPet, our mission is no different. We strive to bring meaning to your pet’s final moments and support you while you weigh one of the hardest decisions that pet parents have to make - deciding how and when to say goodbye.

We are pet owners and animal lovers who empower end-of-life veterinarians that provide compassionate care where our dogs, cats, and companion animals are most comfortable: surrounded by the love of family and the familiarity of home.

Our curated resources are written by licensed professionals, so you don’t have to feel alone in making end-of-life decisions and when the time comes to begin composing your pet’s coda, our community of mobile veterinarians ensures you can find the right support for your pet’s care at home.

We understand the inescapable pain of losing our devoted companions and the void they leave behind. However, throughout your goodbye, we hope CodaPet helps you bring the same meaning to those final moments that your pet brought to your extraordinary lifetime together - a lifetime that’s bonded you forever.

##### OUR VISION

## A peaceful passing at home

To create a new standard for pet end-of-life care and to empower veterinarians economically by making in-home pet euthanasia known and accessible across the United States.

For pet owners that need end-of-life care for a beloved pet, CodaPet’s technology enables a network of veterinarians that provide compassionate in-home pet euthanasia to help ease the pain of pets, so they can have a peaceful passing at the place they feel the most comfortable, surrounded by loved ones.

### About CodaPet

CodaPet enables a network of participating veterinarians to provide peaceful in-home pet euthanasia. Our compassionate and licensed veterinarians are available to help ease the pain of beloved pets at home, surrounded by loved ones.

CodaPet is a vet-owned business. Our solution is tailored to the needs of vets to ensure they can provide pets all over the United States with a peaceful passing at home, surrounded by loved ones. CodaPet was founded in the summer of 2022 by three vets who shared the desire to make in-home pet euthanasia accessible for more families around the United States.
