For Dr. Amanda McCasland, providing in-home pet euthanasia isn’t just about veterinary medicine—it’s about creating a moment of peace when families need it most. After a decade of clinical experience, she now focuses on helping Tulsa-area pets cross the Rainbow Bridge surrounded by love, comfort, and familiar faces.

Dr. McCasland possesses a calm, steady presence that reflects her years of experience in the field. But what makes her approach so special is the deeply personal understanding she brings to end-of-life care. Her journey into veterinary medicine began on a working farm in Owasso, OK, where life and death often went hand in hand.

## **A Childhood Shaped by Life on the Farm**

Growing up among the pastures and fences of her family’s farm, Dr. McCasland was no stranger to the challenges of animal care. She witnessed injuries that required quick thinking—sheep attacked by stray dogs, rabbits caught in fencing—and she never forgot the feeling of wishing she could help.

What stuck with her most, though, were the springtime lambings. When a ewe struggled during birth, the vet was called in, and Amanda watched with wide eyes as the doctor calmly and skillfully brought new life into the world. “It was more magical than a Disney movie,” she recalls.

That early exposure instilled in her not just a love of animals, but a fascination with the art and science of veterinary medicine. She followed that passion through veterinary school and into practice, where she spent ten years working full-time in clinics.

## **A Personal Turning Point**

The shift to in-home euthanasia came after a deeply personal experience. When Dr. McCasland’s own cat became seriously ill, she brought it to work to have its bloodwork checked. But when the decision was made to say goodbye, she brought him home. Surrounded by family—her children, her other pets, and her other beloved cat —it passed peacefully in her favorite spot.

“I realized I was the same vet either way,” she says, “but at home, it felt different. He was calm. We weren’t rushed. It made all the difference.”

That experience led her to offer the same gentle, in-home care to others.

## **Beyond Veterinary Care**

Outside of her veterinary work, Dr. McCasland is a lifelong learner and creative spirit. She has a deep love for languages and once considered a career as a linguist. “It’s like a superpower—being able to talk to people you otherwise couldn’t,” she says. She’s also an avid Latin and powwow dancer, gardener, and reader.

At home, she lives with her family on a dairy goat farm, where she raises Mini Nubians and tends to a lively group of animals. Her crew includes three horses—Denali, Argo, and Buttercup—two livestock guardian dogs, chickens, ducks, a housecat named Ledoux, and a leopard gecko named Jasmine.

## **Expert Care with a Personal Touch**

Dr. Amanda Casland earned her veterinary degree with a deep commitment to compassionate care and end-of-life services. Here’s what she offers:

  * At-home euthanasia starting at $300, including pre-sedation to ease your pet’s transition
  * Private and communal cremation options with transportation included, priced between $150 and $375
  * Keepsakes to honor your beloved pet, from clay paw prints to custom urns



Her goal is to provide a peaceful and comforting experience during one of life’s most difficult moments for both pets and their families.

## **Bringing Gentle End-of-Life Care to Families**
