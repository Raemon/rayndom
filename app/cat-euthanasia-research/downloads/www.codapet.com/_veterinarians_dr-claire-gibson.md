Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I became a vet because I wanted to work with animals and use my skills to give them long and healthy lives with their families. After helping many families euthanize their pets in clinics, I recognized the downfalls and challenges that prevent a peaceful passing. In home euthanasia allows the families’ last moments with their beloved pet to occur in a safe, calm, and familiar environment. I want to have the ability to reduce as much stress and anxiety throughout the process for both the animal and their families.

> One of the best experiences for one of our hardest days. Dr. Gibson text me soon after I set the appointment up to connect and answer any questions we had. During the process she was so kind and patient, talking us through everything that she was doing. We are so happy we chose to go with an in home service where our dog felt comfortable. Would absolutely recommend CodaPet.

> Dr Gibson was absolutely amazing. It was an incredibly hard decision to put my baby boy to sleep as cancer just over took his little body and I looked up in home euthanasia because I wanted him to go at home & couldn’t come up with a person I liked until I saw Dr Gibsons post on Facebook. I honestly can’t thank her enough for her compassion and kindness throughout the whole process. She explained everything that was going to happen and reassured me my baby boy wouldnt feel any pain. I am so blessed to have met Dr Gibson and so thankful for her

> Best decision ever. While my heart is broken, this option of a kind, gentle passing in our home, with no anxiety for my sweet girl was a blessing for both of us. Dr. Gibson was so sweet and compassionate. It is obvious she was born to do exactly this. Her respect for my baby was so comforting. I won't ever go a different route again.

> Our in home pet euthanasia was the kindest thing we could have ever done for our beloved bulldog. She was our faithful companion for 12 beautiful years and Dr. Gibson provided the most beautiful end of life transition we could have asked for. Our girl was not nervous or in pain. Dr. Gibson explained every part of the process and we were so comforted by every step. If its time for the hard goodbye for your beloved four legged family please consider this. We could not be more happy with the peaceful goodbye of our girl. Thank you Dr. Gibson.

> Dr Gibson was super sweet and very understanding and patient. My cat Kizmit has a reputation as a vets worst nightmare. I didn't want the stress and anxiety of taking him to the vet, so I chose home service. He was ready to go. He laid quietly in my lap as Dr Gidson gave him the shots and he passed quietly in my lap. She didn't rush us and gave me extra time to say my goodbyes. She made a nose and paw print for us and took him out wrapped in a blanket on a big pillow. It was a beautiful moment. She was above and beyond. Thank you Dr Gibson.

> Dr. Gibson came out on a holiday to help us; our poor baby was miserable and we knew it was time to let him go. She was kind, patient, and explained everything before she did anything. I would not hesitate to recommend her to anyone who has to make the excruciating decision to say goodbye to their beloved pet. She allowed our pet to pass peacefully, and I will forever be grateful that she responded to our call.

Her clear and gentle explanations through each step of the process helped us to walk through the process of saying goodbye. We are beyond grateful for her help and kindness throughout out this journey. She also went above and beyond to ensure that Kenny’s ashes were returned to us. I can’t say thank you enough to Dr. Gibson!

> Dr. Gibson was so kind and gentle. She explained everything she would do and took her time to learn about my special connection with my sweet girl. Though heartbroken, it was time. I would never do it another way. Being at home with her people around her alleviated any anxiety and let her be at peace and free from pain. Thank you for the service you provide. It was the best final gift I could give to her.

> Dr.Gibson was wonderful through the entire process. This was the first time we have been through this and honestly one of the hardest decisions we've ever had to make. She was there to answer any questions or concerns we had prior to our appointment and very empathetic. When she arrived on the day she was very friendly and explained again the entire process and what to expect. I would honestly recommend her to anyone looking to do this at home. She made the process a little easier with her compassion and caring.

> If this profession must exist, Dr. Claire Gibson is the exact type of person you would want by your side to guide you through such a traumatic experience. It's taken me months to even write a review because I'm still so distraught over my loss, but I have to say she really made the experience the best it could possibly be given the circumstances. She was so incredibly kind and you can just tell she cares and feels for you so much. She was even able to give me peace of mind ahead of our appointment because I was unsure if I was doing the right thing or not. She was able to explain it in a way that just made sense and it made me feel a lot better about it all. She made sure everyone was comfortable and explained the process each step of the way. She even sent me the sweetest sympathy card. I still feel really lucky that she was the doctor I had. I think my experience would have been a lot worse had it not been for her. Thank you so very much - I truly appreciate everything you do.

> Dr. Claire made an unbearable day a lot better. She communicated in a way that was comforting. She made sure we knew what to expect. She was extremely kind to me and explained every step in detail. Oliver was my best friend and she understood my pain. She came to my home so I did not have to have Oliver have any additional stress as he was an anxious dog around strangers. She cares! Highly recommended! Thank you Dr. Claire ♥️

> This was our first time using at home Euthanasia and my family will never go back to the office for this procedure. Dr. Gibson was more than what my family could have expected. She answered all of my questions and was very comforting to our best boy Otis. She made this difficult decision a lot easier to deal with after he was gone. I have always second guessed doing this to past fur babies but she confirmed what we were doing was the right choice for our boy. A little over a week my other fur baby that was attached to him has also been able to move forward. If it's in your budget this is the best way to go especially for animals that are scared of the vets office. We will be using this service again. Thank you Dr. Gibson.

> Codapet was the best choice to help our dog at the end of his life. Dr. Claire Gibson was extremely professional and helpful in every aspect of the procedure, by telling us what was going to happen and what to expect. She told us to take as much time as we needed and sat on the floor with us and talked. Tex, our mixed shepherd for 13 years, passed peacefully as we were petting him and talking to him on his bed. It was comforting to know he was not leaving this world on a cold steel table in a vet’s office. Thank you so much Dr. Gibson for your compassionate care during this difficult time.

> Dr. Gibson was professional and compassionate. This is the 3rd time I’ve needed to use euthanasia services for one of my cats with the first 2 being at a vet’s office. Our experience with Dr Gibson was by far the most peaceful. I’m so thankful we were able to say goodbye at home where our sweet Isabel was comfortable in her favorite spot. I was also thankful that Dr. Gibson was available within a day’s notice on a weekend. My heart goes out to anyone faced with this decision but I am at peace knowing I gave her the most loving and peaceful goodbye.

> Having to put down my best friend Blueberry was the absolute hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life. I am so blessed I found Dr Gibson information she was so sweet to my parents and I & completely understood the pain I was going through. When I made the decision to have him put down I had no idea what the process was and when she arrived to my house she explained everything she was going to do and before each thing she did she repeated what was going to happen. I will be forever grateful for her compassion and care she had with Blueberry. If you see this Dr Gibson thank you for everything & specially thank you for being so kind.

> I recently had to make the tough decision to assist my dog of 15 years cross the rainbow bridge. After some research and local community recommendations I chose Dr. Claire Gibson and CodaPet to help me through this difficult period. Scheduling the appointment was a simple process and there was clear communication. Shortly afterwards I was contacted by Dr. Gibson and I can’t fully express how grateful I am for her concern, compassion and professionalism throughout this entire journey. I highly recommend her and CodaPet, they make a very difficult and painful time easier to navigate.

He did not suffer more than he already was suffering, and Dr Gibson was kind and professional. She then checked on me the following day which was incredibly gracious.

> Dr. Gibson was the absolute greatest when we made the decision to say goodbye to our beloved Bentley. This was the first time we have used her & unfortunately it won’t be the last. Taking our kitty anywhere was always so stressful on him. She was the kindest & most compassionate vet ever. She handled him so gently. This was the best outcome for such a horrible situation.
