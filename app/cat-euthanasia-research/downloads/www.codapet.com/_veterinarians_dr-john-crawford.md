Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

A client said to me 'You must hate your job.' I explained that I'm here for you and your Family during one of your greatest times of need. Bringing comfort, peace, and ending suffering is a wonderful service we can offer our four-legged Family members. Households frequently comment they felt a huge relief, like the weight of worry and concern was removed, knowing they did everything possible. They also appreciated saying goodbye in their own home, to grieve in private, and that CodaPet handled all the arrangements. Bringing this comfort, peace, and calm to the community is my ‘why.’

## What pet parents are saying

> Dr. Crawford is truly an exceptional veterinarian—compassionate, patient, and deeply caring. He helped my beloved dog, Dada, pass peacefully, guiding me through one of the most difficult moments of my life with such kindness and understanding. His gentle approach made all the difference, and I will always be grateful for the care he provided. He went above and beyond by thoughtfully making sure I had Dada’s paw print, even hand-delivering it. That level of kindness speaks volumes about his dedication to both his patients and their families. Dr. Crawford is an absolute angel—God-sent during such a heartbreaking time. He is not only a skilled professional but also a genuinely kindhearted person. Anyone lucky enough to have him as their vet will be in the best hands. Thank you, John, for everything!

> My family and I are incredibly grateful for Dr. John Crawford. I can’t imagine any other way we could have let our sweet girl of 18 years go. John was beyond empathetic and created an atmosphere of comfort for us and our Dog as she prepared to pass. Please don’t look any further for a euthanasia service, your loved one deserves someone like John to gift them their most comfortable last moments. Thanks again John, your service is invaluable 🙏🏼

> Good morning…I’m good today following the passing of my 17 year old Husky thanks to Codapet in-home euthanasia services. It was not a solemn occasion, I had Dr. John Crawford who is active military and a veterinarian responsible for taking care of dogs with the US Army and Navy come to our home. The whole process took about two hours and 45 minutes as he sat on the floor with me getting to know both of my dogs and got them both so comfortable that they fell asleep right in front of him he then gave my Husky Zira a powerful sedative in the nape of her neck. After a time, my Husky Zira She started a deep sleep snoring peacefully with CeeLo our Black Lab a couple of inches from Zira not knowing anything had happened and we continue to just pet her and let the sedative take affect for the next hour and 20 minutes as Dr. Crawford did not want to rush this and give me and Zira the time we needed. Once I indicated that I was ready and he had checked that the Husky felt no reflexes from the pinching of the skin between her toes he gave the final needle stopping her heart within about 30 to 45 seconds Dr. Crawford let me lay with her and CeeLo for as long as I wanted, which was about 20 more minutes. Meanwhile, ALEX, my godson and Willie my godfather were alarm in the sunroom with us sitting there peacefully. Dr. Crawford the veterinarian, then retrieved a pet stretcher from his car, and soft velour blanket, folded in such a way that we could gently lift my Husky from her bed to the soft blanket. We gently lifted her onto the stretcher where she was covered with the blanket with her face exposed and strapped onto the pet stretcher with the care you would exhibit for a small child… I couldn’t think of a better sendoff for a person or Fur baby. I overwhelmingly recommend Codapet to for home-based end of life services for your Fur Babies. With regard to the Veterinarian that came to our home Dr. John Crawford with the United States Army has the disposition of a seasoned Chaplin and is one of the most compassionate people I’ve ever met.

> It's taken me a minute to be able to write about the loss of my Piccola, the loss of losing a her was devastating as her life and spirit changed quickly. Dr. John Crawford is an amazing human. He is an empath for sure, and while his approach with Piccola was very professional... it was also-- so so very kind. You can feel that he is authentic in every way. What stood out to me was not just the kindness towards my daughter Piccola, but I could feel that he could see the pain her mom (me) was in, and he did everything to assure me and my husband in the process. I had "that moment" where I was like--- is this time-- because my pup who was lethargic, and not eating or drinking jumped up to kiss Dr. Crawford--- which scared me---is it too soon-- am I doing the right thing-- and he explained what was happening in her little body, and soul. Dr. Crawford it is the person I never want to see--- but if I have to see someone to help my pet pass... he IS THE person I would want again. Utterly brilliant smart-- UTTERLY kind and authentic human. Thank you Dr. Crawford for being such a special human. I will never forget you. Kind Regards Susan and Robert

> I would like to thank Dr. John Crawford for his care and support this week. I made the decision to liberate my 13 year old dog, Toro, and the gentleness and kindness shown by Dr. Crawford helped me support Toro in his last moments. Dr. Crawford was prompt to arrive at my home in Baltimore City. He spoke calmly and lovingly to Toro throughout the procedure and was very kind to his "brothers" as they gave their goodbyes. There was no anxiety or concern for Toro, he rested peacefully. Equal care was provided as Toro was carried out of our home. Thank you again, Dr. Crawford.

> Having a vet come to my home to euthanize a pet is something that I have thought about for years, but have not done in the past for a variety of reasons. In this case, I had a German Shepherd that I have had for almost 12 years. Although she was brought up in a loving stable home with other animals, children, and unlimited space, was pathologically shy and fearful of strangers. I couldn’t bring myself to make her last life experience be getting carried to the car and into a clinic, which always terrified her, so I contacted CodaPet. Dr. Crawford came to my home after contacting me directly by text. He was not in a hurry and gave my dog time to process the fact that he was there without approaching her. She was nervous and jumpy but calmed down while we talked and I held her. He was gentle with her (and me) and explained the process with the necessary amount of detail and the process was smooth and painless. I could not have asked for a better experience, and if I ever have the need for this service again I will use this company and ask for Dr. Crawford specifically again. The experience of losing a family member is difficult at the best of times, but a home visit was invaluable. Thank you.

> Dr. Crawford was a gift to us in our final moments with our sweet boy. This was me and my partners first dog together, our first child! Dr. Crawford is one of the most emphatic people I’ve ever met. I could tell instantly his respect for our grief and his care for our dog. Not only did he perform the in home pet euthanasia, informing us every step of the way, but he was very compassionate towards our grief. Dr. Crawford took his time and even asked if we needed more time with our dog. We were comforted knowing our dog did not have to move from his own home and bed before he passed. He was able to finally be relaxed like the good ole young days and we were able to say goodbye again while he was without pain before he was officially euthanized. This has to be the hardest job in the world and we are beyond grateful we chose Dr. Crawford.

> Dr. Crawford is far and away the kindest human being I have ever met. Before he even shook my hand he said “I’m sorry we have to meet this way.” He brought such a peaceful presence to what I knew was going to be one of the most difficult days I’ve had to go through. Our appointment was scheduled for an hour and it ended up taking almost two. Fortunately for my wife and I there were moments of levity during the appointment and John didn’t miss a beat adding to that levity. When everything was finished he placed a firm grip on my shoulder to let me know my sweet girl crossed the rainbow bridge and I could see in his face that he shared my pain. That level of compassion was unexpected but incredibly welcomed. Should anyone else find themselves having to make the same difficult choice I had to make I encourage you reach out to Dr. Crawford.

> This morning we said goodbye to our almost 16 yr old dog, Maya. We chose to have this done at home with our family, friends and other pet and it was the best decision for all of us. Dr John Crawford was amazing and put us all at ease the moment he walked into our house. His gentle demeanor and kindness to our girl helped us know that we’d made the right decision. We were able to talk a with him about our relationship, history and feelings about our pet and also this final chapter. When the time came, it was all so peaceful and calm. John is the ultimate professional in how he handled all aspects of the process but also made us feel like we were the only ones in his world today. I would highly recommend John to anyone who needs the perfect best friend for your pet’s final journey.

> I recently had to make the incredibly difficult decision to say goodbye to my beloved cat, Leo, and I'm so grateful that I found John Crawford for in-home pet euthanasia. John was incredibly kind and thoughtful throughout the process, showing deep respect and empathy for Leo and me. His gentle approach and compassion made a world of difference, and being able to say goodbye to Leo at home, rather than in a sterile vet's office, brought so much comfort. John provided Leo with the dignity, care, and peace he deserved, and I couldn’t be more thankful for his presence during such a difficult time. If you're facing this heartbreaking decision, I highly recommend John for his warmth and professionalism."

> Dr. Crawford was amazing! Incredibly gentle, kind & compassionate. He was so loving towards our old man, Mosse. My heart goes out to all my fellow paw-parents. No one ever wants to have to contact Laps of Love, as we know heartbreak soon follows. However, when that dark day comes, Dr. Crawford, with his love & compassion, will make it a little brighter. Dr. Crawford went above & beyond, when a week later, he hand-delivered our boy's ashes. Sadly, this was second experience with Laps of Love. We strongly urge others to contact Laps of Love, as it is the last act of love you can show your 'baby', in the comfort of your own home, surrounded by all of your baby's loved ones.

Her health decline dramatically on Friday night so, on Saturday morning, we searched online, found CodaPet, and discovered that Dr. John Crawford could come to our home later that morning. We could not have hoped for someone more patient, kind, compassionate, and professional than John. As soon as he entered our home, we were enveloped by his gentle, calming presence. He was a warm, comforting light in one of the darkest days of our lives. He ensured that Rosie died without pain or anxiety while being surrounded by her loving family. He's earned our family's eternal gratitude.

> In home pet euthanasia. I'd never thought the day I'd have to say good buy to my baby Greta would even take place. She was the kindest doggie anyone could ever hope for. I don't want to make you sad as you contemplate your own good bye. But, I will tell you that deciding to have Dr. Crawford, with CodaPed, in home pet euthanasia is one of the best decisions I've made for my Greta. Dr Crawford was on time, and very caring. The moment he arrived at my home in his uniform and with a kind smile in his expression, I knew I'd made the right choice. He petted her and spent time getting to know her, he gave me time with her, he allowed me to shower her with all my love, and when the time was right, my little little baby started snoring in her bed and shortly after she crossed her rainbow bridge. I can honestly say it was the most peaceful transition I've ever seen. I am extremely grateful I was able to do that for her. I thank CodaPet for allowing me to get in touch with a compassionate being as Dr. Crawford. Thank you so much for being there for me and my baby. I know she is at peace and no longer in pain now, that comforts me. In home pet euthanasia with Dr. John Crawford is the right choice. (Thank you for being there for us.)
