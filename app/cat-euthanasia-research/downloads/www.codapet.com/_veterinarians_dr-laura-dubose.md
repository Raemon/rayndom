Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I have spent the majority of my career as a spay/neuter veterinary surgeon, helping thousands of animals live healthier lives while also reducing the number of unwanted pets. That work taught me the importance of compassion, prevention, and service to both pets and their families. Over time, I felt called to focus on another important part of veterinary medicine—end-of-life care. I believe every pet deserves to pass peacefully in a familiar place, surrounded by people they know and love. When I’m not working, I enjoy mountain biking, hiking, and camping with my four-legged best buddy Hopper, visiting my son at Clemson, who is continuing the Tiger tradition, and spending time with my daughter, who is a senior in high school. I know personally the comfort and joy animals bring to our lives, and it’s so important to honor them with dignity and love at the end. I consider it a privilege to walk alongside families during such an important time. My approach is guided by empathy, compassion, and respect—for both the pets and the people who cherish them.

> We recently had to say goodbye to our sweet dog, D.O.G., and Dr. Laura Dubose was the one who came to help us. She was incredibly kind, gentle, and compassionate through the entire process. Dr. Dubose treated D.O.G. with so much respect and care, making sure he was comfortable and peaceful until the very end. Even in such a heartbreaking moment, her calm and understanding presence brought us comfort. We will always be grateful for the compassion she showed our family and our boy.

> Kind,caring,understanding, compassionate,patient and professional. These are just a few words to describe Dr. DuBose. She explained everything in detail about the entire process. She let us take our time deciding when to start,and when to move forward to the next step. She loved on Dixie like she was one of hers. She treated Dixie with care, love and respect. I have nothing bad to say about any of our experience with Dr. DuBose.
