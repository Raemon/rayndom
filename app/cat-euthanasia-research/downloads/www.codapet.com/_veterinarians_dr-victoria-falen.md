Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

Becoming a veterinarian was a natural path for me, but not just because I love animals — which I do with my whole heart. I’ve always felt a strong pull to help people as well. Being a vet allows me to do both: support the health and wellbeing of animals, while also walking alongside the people who love them. I’ve seen firsthand how deep that bond can be, and how much it means to have someone you trust caring for your beloved pet. One of the things I love most about veterinary medicine is that it’s always evolving. There’s always something new to learn — whether it’s a medical advancement, a new approach to treatment, or simply a better way to connect with clients and their animals. That constant growth keeps me inspired and grounded. Over time, I’ve become especially passionate about in-home euthanasia. It’s one of the most meaningful aspects of what I do — helping families say goodbye in the comfort of their own homes, with peace, dignity, and love. I consider it an honor to provide that kind of care during such an emotional time, and I’m deeply committed to making those final moments as gentle and respectful as possible for both the pet and their people. At the end of the day, my heart is in this work — not just for the animals, but for the humans who love them just as fiercely.
