Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

Being a vet was a childhood dream that started when I was about 4 years old. I started to develop a strong interest in senior pets and end of life care during vet school. I loved the human animal bond and felt so much reward from being able to walk with owners through their pet's later stages of life. I grew up with a little Westie named Maxie. She was my constant companion through grade school and started living with me when I went to vet school. I was her sole caregiver during her "senior years" until I made the decision to say goodbye to her when she was 17 years old. I was a vet at the time and had the gift of having my colleague being able to come to my home. I said goodbye to Maxie surrounded by friends in the comfort of our home. I wish everyone had the opportunity to say goodbye to their furry family members where so many of their memories are made and where they feel most comfortable.

> It was very difficult to make the decision to put my fifteen year old pup Lucy to sleep. Dr. Stukey provided in-home euthanasia with the utmost care, compassion, empathy and respect for both me and my girl Lucy. On one of the saddest days of my life, Dr. Stukey was a true blessing. Dr. Stukey was an angel when I really needed one. I will always be grateful for the loving way that she handled a truly difficult situation. Thanks again.

> We recently had to say goodbye to our beloved cat, and I can’t express how grateful I am for the care we received. Dr. Stukey was incredibly compassionate and gentle from start to finish. She explained every step of the process in a calm, reassuring way and made sure Allie was comfortable and at peace. Even though it was one of the hardest days of our lives, she made it feel as dignified and loving as possible. I truly could not have asked for a better experience under such heartbreaking circumstances.

I hope that when you read this message it will reassure you that you and your fur baby will be in good hands with Dr. Kirsten Stukey. Everything happened so fast for us, and I am thankful that we landed someone with compassion and gentleness during this difficult period.

> Dr. Stuckey was extremely sensitive to our situation in losing our family dog. He was extremely sick and unable to walk anymore. Her bedside manner during our worst hour and caring handwritten letter of her condolences afterwards were surprising and truly appreciated. We have never been more grateful and will always try to use her services again for any of our pet needs. While heartbreaking, it was by far the best experience we've had with the passing of a loved pet.

> Our loving girl, Mochi, had started to show signs of canine cognitive dysfunction earlier in the year and as the months passed, it became evident that her quality of life was declining and she was ready to cross the rainbow bridge. She gave us an amazing 14 years of love, laughter, and joy. We wanted to give her the most beautiful peaceful transition that we could and are so grateful to Vets like Dr. Kirsten Stukey at Codapet that offer the wonderful service of at home pet euthanasia. This is the work of earth angels. I don't have the words to express how grateful we are for the amount of care and compassion given at this challenging time of grief. In her last days, Mochi had begun to have seizures and this created a greater urgency in an effort to limit her suffering and we were so grateful for the responsiveness of Dr. Stukey to our questions and the scheduling flexibility of CodaPet to allow us to move up our appointment. Having enough time to say goodbye in the comfort of your own home is such an amazing privilege. Thank you to the wonderful professionals like Dr. Stukey who make this possible.

> Dr. Kirsten Stuky is a very caring vet. My 225 lb Mastiff could not stand up because his hips gave out. He was 11 which is old for a Mastiff. She came to my house to euthanize him. She was kind and gentle to him and he slipped away peacefully. None of the other vets I called would take care of him because of his size. Dr Kirsten made it work. She drove him to the crematorium and texted to reassure me that she had checked him one more time to make sure he had passed. I had asked her to do that and she did even though she knew he was gone. I would use her again. She calmed a traumatic situation.

> When I called CodaPet, the greeting I received from the vet-tech scheduler was warm and kind. She was thorough in gathering information from me to start the request for services, and explained the process and pricing, etc. She was very good at helping me. (CodaPet is the most reasonably priced service in the Dallas-Metro area, and Dr. Stucky doesn't charge a travel fee if within their large service area, as most companies do.) She told me about Dr. Kirsten Stucky, the professional, loving, intelligent and kind vet who came to my home and helped me send my 8-yr-old catmate to heaven (He was that good a little being...😻! ) Dr. Stukey knows her stuff. She was focussed on calming and respectfully easing Emmett into his death, and he had only a short time of fear, because she is so adept at seamslessly doing the procedure. She was VERY attentive to me, my wishes and my well being. I can't imagine a more well suited veterinarian to help critters and animal parents through such a difficult time. She truly is a blessing to our community of animal lovers. I wish she were MY doctor, really. Janet Gillespie

> Last month we said goodbye to our precious 17 year-old dachshund, Lucy. After seeing an online post telling of their own personal experience with home euthanasia, we knew that would be an excellent choice for us as well. We had Dr. Kirsten Stukey, with CodaPet, come to our home. Our primary concern was to not add any more anxiety than necessary for Lucy and Dr. Stukey was perfect in every way. We reached out on their website, she quickly responded, and our appointment was set. She arrived promptly and met our little girl. Dr. Stukey explained how she would do things, and made sure she answered all of our questions. I was happy that I could hold Lucy throughout the entire process, it was so peaceful. Dr. Stukey is the most compassionate, gentle, caring individual, just what you want when having to say your last goodbye. I highly recommend Dr. Stukey if you ever need this service.

> Dr.Kirsten Stukey happened to be a godsend for our family last Friday through Codapet. My wife and I were very hesitant on deciding when we will ask for pet euthanasia because we really thought Gala (our almost 13yr old German Shepherd) will one day just not wake up, and spare us from making this tough choice. Pets are family. For the past couple of months, we just saw that Gala slowly but steadily was getting older and unable to do what she loved. Asking for euthanasia was very hard, but asking for in-home euthanasia was a no brainer for us. Gala loved being at home and was not very happy about a vets office. In-home euthanasia was our no.1 choice Decent pricing and very easy to book online. When Gala saw Dr. Kirsten come inside the house our pup was very calm, and then when she sat next to her our pup exhaled like saying “0h good, you are here”. Kirsten took the time and explained everything to us. The empathy and dedication Kirsten had towards our family was priceless. Caring and loving people like Kirsten is what the world needs when it comes to these services. Small details like treats for Gala, paw impression, and more. I will always remember the beautiful ceremony we all had. This was my first time putting a dog to sleep and I can’t thank her enough for the compassionate experience we had. Plus the ease of booking and communicating with her prior to her arrival. One more thing: You have all the tools to heal your heart and when it’s time, requesting this service can make your pet go peacefully without much suffering. Oh and if you live in the Dallas area, you have Dr. Kirsten Stukey to come help. 💛🐶🤍

> Dr. Kirsten Stukey was the comfort and guide we needed to give our last bit of love to our baby sunshine. In the middle of the night our dog was having majot issues after a week of a down turn of her health. Our vet suggested she would only have days to live. That night at 1am she let me know she was ready to go and I knew I wanted it to be at home. I found Coda pet and Dr. Kristen through a Google search and was able to set an appointment for the same day and received confirmation by 2am. Dr. Stukey made text contact with me that day and arrived on time. She was so gentle and kind to both my fiance and I and our pup. Payment is arranged through the site so you don't need to worry about any of that during the process. Our baby peacefully crossed the rainbow bridge. We were given plenty of time during the process to say our goodbyes. I held my pup on my lap as she passed. She then gently took our pup with her in a beautiful basket to be cremated. I cannot recommend Dr. Stukey enough and will always to all I know. This was one of the most painful events of my life and Dr. Stukey guided us and provided comfort. For that alone, I'll forever remember her.

> My family and I are so grateful for Dr. Kristen. She was able to come out the same day we made the painful decision that it was time to put our beloved Percy to sleep. She came at 7pm on a Friday night so we could all be there with him at the end. He was a very anxious dog who didn't like strangers. But she was so gentle and careful with him (and with us) that she won over his trust. His passing was peaceful surrounded by love. This type of home service is not cheap, but it was worth it for the comfort and peace of being in his own home for his last moments. And compared to similar home service companies, it was extremely reasonable.

It was such a blessing for him to be at home in his usual sleeping spot when he passed.

> We are deeply grateful to Dr. Stukey for the compassionate care and kindness she showed during one of the most difficult moments our family has faced. Saying goodbye to our cherished dog, Archer, was heartbreaking, but being able to do so at home made all the difference for Archer and us. Dr. Stukey approached every step with gentleness, empathy, and patience. She explained everything clearly, gave us all the time we needed, and treated Archer with the dignity and love he deserved. One detail that meant so much to us was the way she prepared a cozy, respectful space for Archer’s final journey—complete with a cute blanket, soft pillows and silk flowers. It was beautiful and deeply moving. Her quiet, respectful presence brought comfort in a moment filled with sorrow. It takes a special kind of person to do this work with such grace and heart. We will never forget how she helped ease Archer’s passing, allowing him to leave us peacefully, surrounded by love and familiarity. Thank you, Dr. Stukey, for helping us say goodbye in the most meaningful and compassionate way possible.

> Dr Stukey was amazing, it was a very difficult decision we had to make, and it was the right one, but it hurt all the same. Dr Stukey came in very professional, handled my 3 year and 6 year olds questions like a pro. She made us all comfortable and guided us through the process and was right there with us when we grieved. I’m a talker and I could not get a single word out at the time, but growing through our 20s into our 30s with our dog was such an amazing time, and Apollo was the greatest dog. The great white wolf, the protector, the goof ball. I’ll miss you forever old man. Also, as I’ve aged, I’ve learned to let go and really cry, once me and my brother in law loaded Apollo up, dr Stukey turned to me and in all my sobbing asked to give me a hug, and I just thought sure that’s what people do, and I am so thankful, I didn’t realize how much I needed that hug and I’m not a hugger and I balled even harder. Thank you for that. I’ll always remember that.

She took her time informing us and helping our pet through their end of life in such a beautiful, dignified and compassionate way. When we have the need for these services in the future, we will remember and come back to Kirsten for this peaceful and deeply personal experience. Thank you, Kirsten.

> Kirsten was so kind and compassion during such a difficult time. She allowed my family and I as much time as we needed to say goodbye both before and after. She talked us through the process and made sure we were ready with each step. I’m so grateful that we were able to send my baby off in our own home, surrounded by people who loved him and who he loved back.

> Dr. Stukey had a kind, thoughtful, and compassionate presence. She sat with us and made sure we had all the time we needed to say goodbye to our friend. Allowing our pet to pass at home was a huge comfort to us and I’m sure to her too. Can’t say enough about how highly I’d recommend Dr. Stukey to anyone in a similar situation.

> Dr. Stukey made an incredibly hard day so much easier. She spent some time petting and loving on our furbaby and made sure we were completely ready for the process to begin. We got to hold our pup as he peacefully drifted into sedation then crossed over the rainbow bridge. The way she snuggled him up in a sweet basket to take him to his final resting was so loving. We are so glad we chose CodaPet and Dr. Stukey.

> I had to say goodbye to my 10-year-old Great Dane, Hendrix, in September. I knew I wanted him to be at home, surrounded by his favorite people and as comfortable as possible. This is still a little fresh, so I won’t recount the entire experience, but I feel extremely fortunate that we ended up with Dr. Stukey. She was incredibly professional and considerate. She explained every step before proceeding and always made sure we were ready. Hendrix was often shy around new people, but he took to her immediately. He was calm and comfortable, and everything went as peacefully as I could have hoped for.

> I would highly recommend CodaPet for anyone having to make the difficult decision for their pet. Dr. Stukey came and made us feel instantly comfortable and reassuring that we were making the right choice for our sweet Penny. She went peacefully and I will be forever thankful to Dr. Stukey for her care.

> Very kind and empathetic. Answers questions and has a warm personality and tone of voice. She also did the cutest set up of my cat bundled up after when I wasn't sure if I wanted to look or not and I'm glad I did, she looked peaceful and like herself

> Dr. Stukey helped tremendously on one of the most difficult days of my life. She listened to me and validated me and my experience with her could not have been better given the upsetting circumstances. She is beyond compassionate and treated me and my pet with the highest level of care possible. I am so grateful that I found her and that she came to my aid. I would highly recommend her to others.

> I can't say enough good things about our experience with Dr. Kirsten Stukey. She was prompt in reaching out and scheduling was very easy. No detail was overlooked as far as making this a smooth transition and being respectful during such a hard time. She was the right balance of somber and personable. Everything was such a good experience for such a bad time. I can't thank her enough for coming in and just making such a hard thing a little more peaceful.

> Dr. Stukey helped me and my little Dante through an incredibly difficult and sad day. He was suffering, and he was in dire need of relief. She was so kind and patient and just a calming presence for the both of us. We never want that day to come, but I highly recommend Dr. Stukey when that time comes.

> After 18 wonderful years with my sweet Tinker, it was finally time to say goodbye. A year earlier, I had spoken with my vet about when and how to make this decision, knowing the day would eventually come. After managing kidney failure, hyperthyroidism, and other health issues for as long as we could, her body began to give out. We called CodaPet at 5 p.m. on a Tuesday for an emergency in-home euthanasia appointment, knowing in our hearts that Tinker wouldn’t make it through the night. The receptionist was compassionate and professional—she helped finalize the payment and offered keepsake options. Dr. Kristen Stukey stayed in touch with us about her arrival time and arrived just three hours after our call. Dr. Kristen and the CodaPet team made an incredibly difficult experience as peaceful and gentle as it could possibly be. For such a heartbreaking day, I have no regrets about making that call. This is such a challenging field—one that demands deep empathy and strength—and I’m incredibly grateful for the love and care they showed. With so much love, thank you.

> Dr Stukey was FANTASTIC! I cannot say enough great things about her. She was knowlegable, calm and very good with our cat. This was my 25 year old daughters cat that she had since she was 5 or 6 and it was the first time she has had today goodby to a Pet . Dr Stukey answered all of her questions, and was SO compassionate and caring. If you have to say goodbye to your Pet I would strongly reccomend Dr Stukey!!!! A+++++++ She even has her trunk decorated and has a sweet basket for your beloved Pet.
