Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

As a veterinarian, my ultimate goal is to ensure the well-being and comfort of the animals under my care, especially during their most vulnerable moments. Offering home euthanasia allows me to provide a compassionate and peaceful transition for pets in the familiar and comforting environment of their own home. By eliminating the stress of a clinic visit, I can offer both the pet and their family a sense of calm and tranquility during this difficult time. It's an honor to provide this final act of kindness and support to families as they say goodbye to their beloved companions, allowing them to cherish their memories without the added burden of travel or unfamiliar surroundings.

## What pet parents are saying

> I cannot imagine a better way to go about this process. Dr. Marisel and Lynn could not have been more professional and supportive. They took care of our good old man, Calvin, and ensured he was comfortable, relaxed, and at peace. A very sincere thank you for all that you did!

> They were punctual, respectful and kind. They leave you plenty of time to say goodbye and to grieve in private before the final shot. They are not intrusive at all and they will allow you to say goodbye somewhere that your animal is comfortable with instead of its last moments being in a cold uncaring vet office.

> We had a 12.5 year old Great Dane that had been struggling for a while with her back legs and hips. We knew we didn’t want to wait until she couldn’t get up at all so we had Dr. Marisel come assess her and let us know her honest opinion. We knew in our hearts it was time but just wanted to make sure since she was still alert and Dr Marisel was so kind and gave us all the information/ education we needed to make the best decision for our girl. Dr Marisel was never pushy and overall very professional and sympathetic of the decision we were having to make. If I have the means and the time I will always choose in home euthanasia knowing my pets can be in the comfort of their own home and in a familiar place when I put them at peace.

> Dr. San Miguel could not have been better. She was kind, patient, and compassionate to us and our beloved dog Jake. She made herself available to us via phone/text beforehand to just talk things over and then reached out several times after to check on us. We would definitely recommend her. She can make a difficult time just a little bit easier.

> Dr. Marisel and team were wonderful. The experience of losing a member of the family of 14.5 years was heartbreaking but their compassion and care allowed for our beloved Bruno to pass in the comfort of his own home while I held him until he reached the rainbow bridge! He was able to be surrounded by his family and just go to sleep at home, thankful for their support and compassion during this difficult decision and time!
