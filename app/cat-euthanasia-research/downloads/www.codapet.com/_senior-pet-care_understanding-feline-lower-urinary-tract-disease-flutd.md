# Understanding Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease (FLUTD)

[Dr. Karen Whala](/experts/dr-karen-whala)

August 06, 2023

Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease (FLUTD) is a common condition in cats, affecting their bladder and urethra. This guide covers its causes, symptoms, diagnosis and treatment options, helping cat owners recognize early signs and manage their pet's health effectively.

## **What is FLUTD?**

**Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease (FLUTD)** is an encompassing term that refers to various conditions impacting a cat's lower urinary tract, including the bladder and urethra. These medical conditions manifest in clinical symptoms that are incredibly similar, and identifying the underlying cause often requires extensive investigation.

Instances of FLUTD can range from minor behavioral conditions like Feline Idiopathic Cystitis (FIC) to severe cases of urethral obstruction, that can pose a grave risk to your pets health and should be treated with urgency.

Some of the more common forms of FLUTD involve Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs), bladder stones (Urolithiasis), Feline Idiopathic Cystitis (FIC), and sometimes cancer of the bladder or urethra. While it can affect cats across all age ranges, FLUTD is commonly observed in young to middle-aged adult cats.

## **Common Causes of FLUTD**

There are several common causes of FLUTD in cats. These include

  * **Idiopathic cystitis** \- which is a condition characterized by inflammation of the bladder with an unknown cause, where diagnostics are unable to determine a cause.
  * **Urolithiasis** \- the formation of urinary stones or crystals; or urethral obstruction, a serious and life-threatening blockage that prevents a cat from urinating.
  * **Behavioral** \- A phenomenon where stress can trigger urinary symptoms. This is a common cause for indoor-only cats in multi cat households.



Understanding these causes can help cat owners identify potential risks and take preventive measures. Remember, urethral obstruction is a medical emergency that necessitates immediate veterinary attention. We're here to help decipher these complex medical terms and conditions, providing expert advice to support your pet's well-being.

## **How Common is FLUTD in Cats?**

Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease (FLUTD) affects approximately 1-3% of cats each year. This condition is often observed in middle-aged cats, particularly those who are overweight and lead a sedentary lifestyle. Environmental factors play a significant role, too; cats using indoor litter boxes, having reduced access to natural outdoor environments, or experiencing stress from changes or multi-cat household dynamics may be more prone to developing FLUTD. Ensuring that your cat stays hydrated and maintaining a healthy weight can be key in the management and prevention of this disease.

## **The Anatomy of a Cat's Urinary System**

To better understand FLUTD, let's take a quick look at a cat's urinary system. This system consists of the kidneys, the ureters, the urinary bladder, and the urethra. It's responsible for filtering out waste products from the blood and removing them from the body in the form of urine. Any alterations or dysfunctions in these body parts can contribute to FLUTD.

The kidneys play a crucial role in maintaining the right balance of water, salts, and acids in the body. They also aid in controlling blood pressure, stimulating red blood cell production, and processing Vitamin D. The ureters are the tubes that transport urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder, where it is temporarily stored before being eliminated through the urethra and out into the environment.

## **Signs and Symptoms of FLUTD**

### Physical Symptoms of FLUTD

Cats suffering from Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease (FLUTD) may display various physical symptoms that could indicate discomfort or pain. Recognizing these signs is crucial for identifying the condition and seeking prompt veterinary care. Some of the symptoms include:

  * **Difficulty or pain during urination** , which may be noticed as hesitancy or prolonged squatting
  * **An increased frequency of urination attempts** , often with little urine produced
  * **Vocalizations like crying or meowing** that suggest distress or pain while urinating
  * **Blood in the urine** , which can range from a light pink tinged to a darker reddish color
  * **Inappropriate urination in areas other than the litter box** , on horizontal surfaces typically, a sign that your cat may be unable to control their bladder. It is important to distinguish inappropriate urinate on horizontal surfaces vs vertical surfaces. Urination on vertical surfaces typically indicate urine marking and is different from FLUTD symptoms.
  * **Excessive licking of the genital area** , which may indicate irritation or discomfort



The presence and severity of these symptoms can vary depending on the underlying cause of FLUTD, such as urinary stones, infection, or stress. Therefore, it's essential to closely observe any changes in your cat’s urination habits and seek veterinary evaluation to address the specific cause and provide appropriate treatment.

Understanding and addressing the physical discomfort your cat may be experiencing is an important aspect of care. If you notice any of these symptoms, a thorough examination by a veterinarian can help ensure your cat receives the comfort and care they need.

### Behavioral Changes in Cats with FLUTD

When your feline friend is dealing with Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease (FLUTD), it's not just their physical health that's affected. Their behavior can change in noticeable ways. A kitty who once was meticulous about their litter-box protocol might suddenly start avoiding it, or have accidents elsewhere in the house. They may display aggression or seem irritable when they were once peaceful and easygoing. You might also observe excessive grooming, particularly around the perineum area, which can suggest they’re in pain or experiencing discomfort.

Recognizing these behavioral nuances is crucial, as they are often the first signs that your cat isn't feeling their best. By being alert to any new habits or shifts in temperament, you can catch issues early and seek the necessary help. Our team grasps the complexities of these behavioral shifts and is ready to offer comfort, understanding, and direction to you and your beloved pet during this tough phase.

### When to Consult a Vet

If your cat is displaying signs of FLUTD (Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease), seeking veterinary care promptly is imperative. Particular attention is required if your male cat is attempting to urinate but only manages to produce little to no urine—this could signify a urethral obstruction. Such a blockage is a critical emergency and necessitates immediate veterinary intervention. Timely action on your part can be crucial to your pet's health and may prevent further complications.

### Chronic vs Acute FLUTD Symptoms

FLUTD symptoms can manifest in various ways and understanding whether they are chronic or acute is crucial for providing the appropriate care. Chronic symptoms are those that develop gradually over an extended period. They can include consistent straining to urinate, producing small amounts of urine more frequently, and repeated licking of the genital area. On the other hand, acute symptoms arise suddenly and can be life-threatening, requiring immediate veterinary attention. These may involve an inability to urinate, severe pain, vocalizing, or lethargy.

Differentiating between chronic and acute symptoms is an essential step in managing your cat's FLUTD and ensuring they receive the necessary medical intervention. Chronic symptoms, although less dramatic, can point to an underlying issue that needs to be addressed over time. Acute symptoms often signify a blockage or another emergency and denote a situation where every moment counts.

By recognizing these signs and responding accordingly, you assure that your feline friend gets the help they need when they need it. When faced with any uncertainties regarding your pet's symptoms, a consultation with a veterinarian can guide you through the next steps.

## **Diagnosing FLUTD**

### Veterinary Examination

If you notice your cat showing signs of discomfort during their bathroom breaks, or even signs of avoiding their litter box entirely, it's natural to feel concerned. The first step in diagnosing Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease (FLUTD) is a thorough veterinary examination. Let's explore what this entails.

During the visit, your veterinarian will start by gathering an inclusive health and habit history. They'll ask about your cat's behavior changes, diet, water intake, and the occurrence and frequency of any aberrant bathroom behavior, like accidents outside the litter box, or blood in the urine. Because cats tend to be very sensitive to change, your vet will also be interested in learning about any environmental changes, or new stressors, such as a change in diet, a new human or animal housemate, moving to a new home, or any other recent change.

This verbal examination is crucial as it gives context to the physical examination and diagnostic tests, providing the vet with an overall picture of your feline companion's health. It may also be helpful to show the veterinarian any pictures of abnormal urine or short videos of abnormal behavior you’ve witnessed.

The vet will then conduct a comprehensive physical examination. This generally includes checking the cat’s weight, listening to the heart and lungs, and a meticulous check of the lower urinary system. Palpating the cat’s abdomen can help the veterinarian detect any abnormalities like bladder stones, a thickened bladder wall, or any discomfort your cat feels upon abdominal touch.

We know veterinary examinations for FLUTD can often be stressful for both the cat and the family witnessing it. However, these are necessary steps for the accurate diagnosis and treatment of FLUTD. Your veterinarian will use all the resources at their disposal to make this process as comfortable as possible for your cherished pet.

### Role of Medical History in Diagnosing FLUTD

In diagnosing FLUTD, your cat's medical history plays a vital role. Providing a detailed medical history, including any changes in behavior, diet, and urination habits, can help the vet make a more accurate diagnosis. This information can provide clues about the possible causes of your cat's symptoms and guide the vet in recommending the appropriate tests and treatment. It's important to offer as full a history as possible, chronicling any instances of past urinary problems or illnesses that could be influencing your cat's current condition.

### Role of Age in Diagnosing FLUTD

Your pet’s age can signal what type of lower urinary tract disease your pet is more likely to have. For example, a younger cat is less likely to have a urinary tract infection than an older one. Similarly, an older cat is more likely to demonstrate inappropriate urination due to arthritic pain than a younger cat.

### Possible Complications During Diagnosis

Diagnosing Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease (FLUTD) can present certain complications due to the condition's multifaceted nature. Although essential, pinpointing the specific underlying cause from a range of possibilities – such as urinary stones, infection, or even stress – is not always straightforward. This complexity may necessitate an extended battery of diagnostic tests ranging from urine analysis to imaging. Such an intricate diagnostic process underscores the need for patience and precision.

### Understanding Your Cat's FLUTD Diagnosis

Once your cat has been diagnosed with Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease (FLUTD), comprehending the intricacies of the diagnosis, the underlying causative factors, and the prescribed treatment regimen is pivotal. This knowledge is integral in effectively managing your cat's health condition and ensuring the delivery of the best care possible. By understanding FLUTD, you can become proficient in monitoring your cat's health journey, recognizing any deviations in their wellbeing, and communicating effectively with your veterinarian.

## **Performing Tests for FLUTD**

Once your cat goes through a thorough physical examination, your vet may recommend a series of tests. These help pinpoint the exact cause of the urinary issue.

A common test for diagnosing FLUTD is urinalysis. This involves analyzing your cat's urine for any abnormal elements such as red and white blood cells, crystals, or bacteria. It may also detect the presence of anomalous urinary components that can suggest diabetes or kidney disease. Often, your vets order a urine culture, a test that allows any bacteria present in the urine to grow and the type of bacteria to be identified. This test can confirm or rule out a urinary tract infection (UTI) and point to proper antibiotic treatment if a UTI is present.

Further testing could involve blood tests to gauge the overall health status of your cat, and to exclude diseases that might cause similar symptoms. Radiographs or X-rays can be immensely helpful in visualizing stones in the urinary bladder or kidneys. Sometimes, an ultrasound may be necessary to better visualize the bladder and the urinary tract's structure which also helps to rule out bladder cancer.

## **Understanding Diagnostic Results of FLUTD**

After running tests, your vet will discuss the results with you. If the diagnosis is FLUTD, the vet will test and attempt to further classify it into a specific syndrome such as bladder stones, feline idiopathic cystitis (FIC), a urinary tract infection due to bacteria, or an anatomical abnormality. This specific diagnosis helps tailor individual therapy, as the treatment will differ vastly depending on the underlying cause.

Understanding these results and the implication on your cat's health can be overwhelming. Remember, it's okay to ask your veterinarian to explain anything that seems confusing. Your understanding helps your vet care for your cat, as you're a vital member of your cat's health management team.

## **Importance of Early Diagnosis of FLUTD**

Along with providing immediate relief to your furry friend, diagnosing FLUTD early is crucial in preventing serious complications like urethral blockages (more common in males), which can become life-threatening emergencies. The longer your cat suffers with unaddressed FLUTD the more potential for long-term tissue damage or organ damage (such as [acute renal disease](https://www.codapet.com/senior-pet-care/understanding-kidney-failure-in-cats-a-comprehensive-guide)). In addition, an early diagnosis and appropriate treatment can help prevent recurrence which is unfortunately common in FLUTD conditions.

Overall, while diagnosing FLUTD in your cat might feel daunting, remember that your veterinarian is there to guide you through the process. Consult a veterinarian if you notice any change in your pet's behavior or health.

## **Treatment Options for Cat Urinary Tract Infection (FLUTD)**

When your cat is diagnosed with Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease (FLUTD), it's natural to wonder about the treatment options available. In this section, we will explore medical treatments, surgical procedures for severe cases, home care strategies, and recent advancements in FLUTD treatments. Armed with this knowledge, you can better understand your vet's recommendations and make more informed decisions about your cat's treatment.

### Medical Treatments for FLUTD

Once FLUTD is diagnosed, your veterinarian will likely utilize a series of medical treatments based on the cat's specific syndrome, which can include a variety of tools ranging from antibiotics to specially formulated diets.

For instance, a mainstay of treatment for cases involving urinary tract infections is appropriate antibiotic therapy. Antibiotics targeted at the offending bacteria help eliminate the infection, thereby relieving symptoms and preventing further complications; rechecks are often necessary to ensure the infection is resolved. On the other hand, if the FLUTD is due to conditions like Feline Idiopathic Cystitis (FIC), the treatment may involve the use of pain medications and anti-spasmodic drugs. A prescription diet can also be recommended to reduce inflammation and irritation in the urinary tract.

**Increasing water consumption** is often emphasized in managing FLUTD; ample hydration can aid in flushing out urinary crystals or bacteria and supporting kidney health. Your veterinarian may recommend providing a kitty water fountain to encourage drinking or feeding wet food to increase water consumption.

### Surgical Treatments for Severe Cases

In some severe cases of FLUTD, particularly when urolithiasis (bladder stones) or severe urinary tract obstruction is present, surgical intervention may be necessary. Uroliths, solid deposits in the urinary tract, can cause pain, irritation, and life-threatening obstructions. If uroliths cannot be managed or dissolved through dietary changes, your cat may require a cystotomy (surgically opening the bladder) for stone removal.

A severe urethral obstruction is a life-threatening emergency that demands immediate intervention. A cat with a full blockage is unable to urinate and will require sedation, urinary catheterization, intravenous fluid therapy, and sometimes even surgery to remove the obstruction and restore urine flow. Aftercare includes diligent monitoring and possibly a special diet to prevent recurrence.

### Home Care for Cats with FLUTD

Home care plays a significant role in managing FLUTD and ensuring your cat's overall health. Aside from administering prescribed medications faithfully, there are several steps you can take to provide an optimal environment for your cat's recovery and prevention of future flare-ups.

Certain intentional environmental changes may aid in reducing stress triggers, a notable factor in some types of FLUTD like feline idiopathic cystitis (FIC). Providing more litter box options and ensuring easy access to food, water, and safe spaces can help minimize stress for your cat. As a rule of thumb, many vets recommend the home has one litter box per cat, plus one more litter box. The important thing is that your cat can access a litter box that is clean and nearby wherever they wish to spend time. 

Monitor for inter housemate aggression or bullying and for difficulty reaching and getting into a litter box, especially for cats who may also suffer from osteoarthritis. Whenever possible, minimize sudden changes to the environment. Additionally, encouraging abundant water intake, keeping your cat at an appropriate weight, appropriate mental stimulation, and exercise can contribute to managing your cat's weight, another crucial factor in preventing FLUTD.

### Advancements in FLUTD Treatments

As the field of veterinary medicine continually evolves, we're seeing newer and potentially more effective treatment strategies for FLUTD.

Although FLUTD remains a complex condition to manage, scientific advancements have improved diagnosis accuracy and personalized treatment plans. As we learn more about the various causes of FLUTD and their interconnectedness, the ability to tailor treatments to each cat's specific needs improves, enhancing their quality of life and potentially reducing the recurrence of symptoms.

It's important to remember that each cat is unique, and what works well for one might not for another. Discuss various possibilities with your veterinarian to find the best treatment plan for your feline friend, and remember, patience and dedication are key components in managing this condition.

### Long-term Management of FLUTD

The journey through FLUTD with your beloved feline is one of patience and understanding. Implementing lifestyle modifications is crucial for managing this condition. A diet tailored to urinary health, encouraging water intake by providing fresh water sources or wet food, and nurturing a stress-free environment are key elements to address. It's essential to provide quiet and clean litter box spaces, as a comfortable toileting area can significantly reduce the chances of FLUTD flare-ups.

Ongoing veterinary care plays a pivotal role in the wellbeing of your cat. Regular consultations allow for careful monitoring of their urinary health and timely adjustments to their treatment plan, ensuring the most compassionate care for your cat’s needs. At every step, our goal is to be a source of guidance and support, ensuring your treasured feline leads a comfortable and joyful life, despite their condition.

## **Preventing FLUTD in Cats**

### Preventive Measures for FLUTD

Naturally, you want to do what you can to prevent your feline friend from developing FLUTD. But what can possibly be done to ward it off? Let’s explore some of the preventive measures you can take.

One of the key factors is to encourage your cat to drink more water. A well-hydrated cat is less likely to develop crystals in their urine, a common cause of FLUTD. In cases where simply placing water bowls around the house doesn't do the trick, you may consider switching to wet food or getting a cat water fountain. Some families find that letting a bathroom sink drip water slowly into the basin helps while others find their cats sneaking in to get water from a recently used showerhead. Many cats are enticed by the flowing water these devices provide, which encourages them to drink more.

Another crucial aspect is the maintenance of a clean and inviting litter box. Cats are exceptionally fastidious animals and may avoid using a soiled or stinky litter box. As discussed before, pay special attention to the number of litter boxes and how easily accessible they are. Some cats show preferences for the type of the litter substrate as well as the style of litter box (covered or uncovered, top opening, side opening, mechanized, etc). All these factors can contribute to cats holding in their urine for extended periods, which is a potential risk factor for FLUTD.

### Importance of Diet and Hydration

Understanding the role of diet and hydration in preventing FLUTD is critical for any cat owner. A balanced diet containing the right quantity of minerals minimizes the risk of urinary stone formation. A diet too rich in minerals such as magnesium and phosphorus can lead to the formation of certain types of crystals in the urinary tract, a potential cause of FLUTD. 

Some prescription diets are formulated to maintain the proper balance of such minerals as well as promoting a lower pH in the urine, which can dissolve or prevent the formation of certain types of crystals. It is important to note that feeding anything in addition to prescription diets can cause mineral imbalance and alkalinization of the urine which will render the prescription diet ineffective. Therefore, it is important to feed your cat only the prescribed diet, unless otherwise specified by your veterinarian.

Hydration is equally important, as water helps dilute the urine and ensure that the urinary system is flushing out effectively. Canned or wet cat food can be a good supplement for water, particularly for cats who don't have a strong instinct to drink regularly. And, as mentioned earlier, the use of cat water fountains can stimulate interest in drinking water.

### The Role of Regular Veterinary Check-ups

Regular veterinary check-ups play a pivotal role in both early detection and prevention of FLUTD. Early detection means quicker treatment, less suffering for your cat, less potential for long-term tissue or kidney damage, and likely less costly treatments. Regular health checks can often identify issues before they become serious, including early signs of FLUTD.

During the check-up your veterinarian will conduct a thorough physical examination, including screening blood tests and urinalysis. They will also ask about your cat's behavior and history, likely including questions about diet, water intake, and urinary behavior. They will also check for risk factors such as obesity, which can increase the likelihood of a cat developing FLUTD among other diseases.

### Stress Management for Cats

The prevention of FLUTD also hinges on making necessary lifestyle adjustments. We know that stress can be a key factor in the development of FLUTD, particularly in a subset of conditions known as Feline Idiopathic Cystitis (FIC).

Achieving a stable routine, creating a safe and comfortable environment, and affording ample opportunities for play and exercise all contribute to a calmer feline companion. Implementing specific stress management strategies such as pheromone diffusers, offering puzzle feeders, and ensuring vertical space for climbing can significantly help. The role of environmental enrichment is pivotal, not only in providing physical outlets for energy but also in stimulating their senses and encouraging natural behaviors. Interactive toys, scratching posts, and cozy hiding spots can offer important retreats for personal time, all of which foster mental health. Your cat's emotional wellbeing is integral to prevent health issues, and we're committed to supporting you in crafting a nurturing, stress-minimized sanctuary for your beloved pet.

## **Living with a Cat with FLUTD**

### Understanding Your Cat’s Needs

Caring for a cat with FLUTD requires a profound understanding of your furry friend's needs. Unlike in humans, gauging a feline's discomfort can be challenging as cats are adept at concealing their distress, a trait inherited from their wild ancestors.

The initial task lies in identifying signs of FLUTD. As mentioned before, these might include discomfort during urination, frequent urination with minimal output, urination outside the litter box, excessive grooming of the genital area, and in serious cases vocalization and abrupt changes in behavior such as aggression or irritation.

Understanding your cat's needs is not just limited to recognizing FLUTD symptoms but also identifying potential FLUTD triggers, which often include stress, diet, obesity, lack of exercise, and indoor confinement.

The key is to pick up on subtle signs and communication from your cat; being sensitive to their needs and observant of their discomforts can translate into health and safety for your feline.

### Managing FLUTD Flare-ups

Unfortunately, FLUTD is often a recurring condition. Monitoring for and managing flare-ups is crucial to your cat's wellbeing. While an occasional lapse in litter-box use might not seem alarming, recurrent signs should prompt immediate action. Consulting with your vet swiftly can help initiate early diagnosis and intervention and hopefully head off serious complications.

Unless directed by your vet, continue with the general FLUTD friendly measures: increasing your cat’s water intake, maintaining clean accessible litter boxes, feeding as recommended- especially if your cat has been prescribed a certain diet.

If your cat is being treated as an out-patient during a flare-up, do your best to maintain a serene environment. As discussed above, stress is a known trigger for FLUTD and managing stress can go a long way in promoting relief.

Sadly, families with cats who experience frequent or severe occurrences of FLUTD often feel they are waiting for the next emergency. This can contribute to a sense of care-taker fatigue and anticipatory grief. If you feel this may describe you please reach out to your veterinarian for resources or speak with a [professional counselor](https://www.codapet.com/grief-counselors).

### Supporting Your Cat’s Mental Well-being

FLUTD often leads to changes in your cat's behavior. These changes could manifest as restlessness, aggression, irritability, or at times, seclusion. It is essential to understand these signs and take the appropriate steps to address your cat's mental wellbeing.

Environmental enrichment plays a key role here. Access to an assortment of toys, scratching posts, and perches encourage natural behaviors, mitigate stress, and lend positivity. Some cats respond well to calming pheromones which can come in sprays or plug-ins. These devices are designed to spread the chemicals that cats release when rubbing their face on a person or object marking it as safe or non-threatening. On that note, it is important to ensure that your cat has a safe and non-threatening environment. If there is inter-cat aggression or bullying from other housemates (animal or small human) it is crucial to provide a place where your cat(s) can retreat and find solitude if they wish.

Additionally, ensuring that the essentials -water, the proper food, and a clean litter box are readily accessible. Lastly, regular sessions of gentle playtime, petting, and social interaction contribute to your cat's mental wellbeing, establishing a sense of bonding and reassurance.

### Promoting a Healthy Lifestyle for Cats with FLUTD

Alongside managing flare-ups and mental well-being, promoting a healthy lifestyle is pivotal for preventing exacerbations of FLUTD. A balanced diet, regular exercise, and optimal water consumption work together to maintain a healthy urinary tract.

If your cat is overweight, a weight management plan under your vet's supervision is a sensible starting point. Your vet will address both what to feed and how much to feed. They may also formulate a graduated feeding plan to implement the desired changes in a slow and controlled manner.

Promoting interactive play sessions and providing stimulating toys can encourage physical activity and mental stimulation, contributing to a healthier lifestyle.

Finally, offering your cat a stress-free environment by minimizing sudden changes and maintaining a consistent routine can lessen the chances of FLUTD flare-ups.
