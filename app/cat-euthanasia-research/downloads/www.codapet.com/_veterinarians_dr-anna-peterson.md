Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I've always surrounded myself with animals (perk of being a country kid with very understanding parents), and decided to be a veterinarian before I even started kindergarten. After being in clinical practice for 14.5 years, I've developed a passion for physical rehabilitation, hospice, and end-of-life care. I consider it a deep privilege to help pets and clients through the most difficult stage of the human- animal bond.

## What pet parents are saying

> Letting go of a beloved pet is heartbreaking. I wanted my Zooch to stay at home where he was familiar with everything. His health had declined and he was struggling to get up on his own and I couldn’t imagine putting him in my car and taking him somewhere. I called CodaPet and was able to schedule a same day appointment with Dr. Anna Peterson. She was wonderful. Her sweet nature and genuine care for animals was so helpful during this difficult day. She was so calming and thorough. She explained the process before we started and let me know what was happening at every step. I am grateful for this service. It allowed for privacy and my safe space to grieve this loss. I will miss Zooch forever but thankful he is no longer suffering. ❤️💔

> Dr. Anna Peterson preformed an in home euthanasia for our dog, Copper on January 6th 2025 at our home in Ashland, WI. Copper has always been an anxious pup when going to the vet. I feared that we would have to go to the vet for his euthanasia and his last feeling would be anxiety and fear. We were fortunate to find Dr. Peterson. She was patience and kind. We never felt rushed and she took such good care of our little man. I feel confident that he had a peaceful passing and a lot of it was thanks to Dr. Peterson. Our family is forever grateful.

> This was the only pet we have ever had. Our dog tinker was 19 years old, blind, and deaf. Since she was our only pet we didn't know the process of putting her down. It was an emergency and i never thought we couldn't get an appointment at our vet. I had googled your company the night before so when our animal hospital referred Dr. Anna Peterson I felt your company was safe. She had one opening at 7:00 p.m. that day that was perfect for us. She explained everything about the medicine and how it worked. She was so kind and patient. Even when she wrapped tinker in the blanket to bring her to the car she was so gentle with her body. Being at home was a wonderful gift to all of us. I was able to have more peace that tinker could smell her own home. The memorabilia that was included in the price was outstanding.I have told many people about your Doctor and your company and how i would recommend this service for anyone. Thank you so very much! You were a blessing to our family! And thank you for your services to our community.

Your diagnosis of what was happening was hard for me to process and accept. With your words you made me see what was right and what he needed me to do for him. My boy was holding on for me and I needed to set his body free to fly high above in the sky! I appreciate you and the hard job you have knowing you are doing the correct thing while hearing hearts break. Well mine did that day and you gave me respect and I thank you! Forever grateful. Rest in peace and comfort my 16 year and 1 day old Boston Terrier Ceazer puppins💝forever in our hearts.

> I learned about CodaPet after getting a brochure at my vet’s office. Pixie was nearly 17 when her time came but it did not make my decision any easier, but I wanted it to be at home. Coda’s staff were wonderful and walked me through the entire process. They were professional, understanding, and empathetic. When Dr. Peterson arrived at my house, I was immediately put at ease by her calm, caring manner. She was so gentle with Pixie, and explained every step she was taking along the way. Luckily the procedure didn’t take long and it was peaceful, for which I’m eternally grateful. The Coda website also has many resources that have helped greatly in the days since Pixie’s passing. I did opt to have Pixie’s ashes returned to me but I can’t speak to that as I have not yet received them; overall I am impressed with the service Coda provided and can’t tell you how glad I am to have found them. If you’re here, my heart goes out to you. Let Coda help, you will not be disappointed.

> We are so grateful for Dr. Peterson and her openness to offer at-home end of life service. Our dog had always been nervous to leave home, and when she began exhibiting end of life symptoms, it broke my heart to think she would not only be in pain, but also suffer from anxiety at the end of her life, having to take her to the clinic for care. Dr. Peterson not only accommodated us in our home, but was gentle and caring. She made our dog feel at ease and never rushed anything.

> Dr. Peterson is, literally, an answer to my prayers! Words cannot express how grateful we are to have had her come to our home to help us... say goodbye... to our beloved fur-baby, Annie. Nothing was rushed. We talked, as she quickly made friends with both of our dogs. Her compassion & ability to establish rapport is truly amazing! She helped us through an, otherwise, unbearably hard time, and I have since referred to her as an angel. Our precious girl was 14-yrs-old, and had a condition that gradually caused her throat to close up-- making breathing extremely difficult. When it progressed to the point where she was having difficulty even finding a comfortable position to lay in-- we didn't have to make things more stressful for her by hauling her to our vet clinic (with all the noise & commotion there). She was able to quietly & peacefully fall asleep in her own home, in a spot she chose, while I cuddled her. Dr. Peterson then, very compassionately, took care of everything else-- while making sure that we were okay. She left us information on the grief process & contact information for support groups. Having her come to our home may have been more expensive-- but it was worth every cent! Thank God we found her!

> Dr. Anna made the most difficult decision as a pet owner easier with her services. She showed compassion and gave us the time we needed to get through the toughest situation. Our dog who was actually unbelievably calm in her presence and the whole experience couldn’t have gone better. I was concerned having my teen kids watch but she explained the process in just enough detail to prepare us all through each step. I would highly recommend her services and appreciate that she is willing to help people give their pets a chance to be home during the end of life.

> We are so grateful for Dr. Anna Peterson and the compassionate care she provided during one of the hardest moments for our family. She came to our home last week to help our beloved Maude pass peacefully, and we could not have asked for a more caring, gentle, and professional presence. Dr. Peterson took everything at our pace—there was never any rush, only calm and reassurance. She explained every step of the process clearly and compassionately, making sure we understood and were comfortable throughout. She treated Maude with such tenderness and respect, and her kindness extended equally to our family, offering both medical clarity and emotional support. She was personable, warm, and genuine—a true gift in a moment of grief. Dr. Peterson helped create a peaceful and loving space for Maude’s transition, and we will always be thankful for her care. I would wholeheartedly recommend her to anyone facing this difficult decision. Her presence was a comfort beyond words

> I had never met Dr. Peterson until she arrived to euthanize my little boy. He was 16 1/2 years old and had been fine just 2 days earlier. He had 2 days of such a rapid decline and his regular vet was talking about being able to get him in in about a week, which I found to just be cruel. In calling CODApet, they had 2 appointments available that afternoon. I took the 5:00 appointment and let them know my door would be unlocked, so she could just walk in. At 4:30, I brought Carrie into the loving room, put his favorite soft blanket over me and laid him in my lap as I sat in my recliner. Dr. Peterson came through the door as my clocks were chiming 5:00, PERFECTLY on time. She could not have been kinder. She was soft-spoken throughout, explaining every thing she would be doing. She did all she needed to do with Carrie continuing to lie on me and that is where he died. She was empathetic, SO incredibly thoughtful, not seeming rushed, allowing me the time to cry and let her take Carrie when I was ready. I have a second cat that wandered through a bit and she'd talk to him and pet him. I have no idea how many times I said thank you to her. This is the absolute worst time in a pet owner's life but I also believe it's the last thing we can do to love them. Dr. Peterson made this time the easiest she could. I am so thankful for this wonderful, kind woman and this service that didn't make me wait or Carrie suffer. It was the most peaceful time it could have been. I had chosen to have Carrie's ashes returned to me and, coincidentally, they arrived this afternoon. Dr. Peterson had a choice of options for this service as well and my little boy is back home. This woman was an absolute blessing both to me and to the loving care she provided my cat.

> When an unexpected diagnosis left us little time to say goodbye to the coolest cat ever (a part of our family and family lore for over sixteen years), we couldn’t imagine Tsing’s final moments in a clinical setting (in addition to the trauma of getting him there). It was difficult to think about a potentially stressful end for a cat whose personality was consistently “chill.” So, when our trusted and most awesome veterinarian explained the services of CodaPet, we could not imagine a better setting. And just as described, Dr. Anna Peterson was simply wonderful – so extremely skilled and competent, while incredibly compassionate and understanding of our situation. We were able to gather our family together, both remotely and in person, to share our favorite “Tsing moments” while Dr. Anna made quiet preparations, allowing us time to say goodbye and be with him until she, ever so gently, eased Tsing into his next cat life. I cannot effectively describe how kind and considerate Dr. Anna was every step of the way. Family present online commented on how they felt included because of her careful attention, calm demeanor, and reassuring explanations. Once he had passed, she gave us all the time we needed, then carefully swaddled Tsing in the coziest of quilts to carry him away. Without hesitation, I would highly recommend an in-home pet euthanasia for a most peaceful end of life experience. And, if you are fortunate to have Dr. Anna Peterson, I know you will be ever so grateful for her expertise, and the tender care your pet receives.

> Our beloved dog, Rainy, had a bad fall and hurt himself so badly that he couldn't stand. We were so lucky to have Dr. Anna Peterson nearby. She was able to come to our home that day to give Rainy a peaceful passing. Dr. Peterson was more than kind and caring, she was so gentle with Rainy, and later distracted and played with our puppy so that we could say our last goodbyes to Rainy. I can't say enough about how much we appreciated her kindness and how much it meant to us. It is hard to lose a friend, even if the friend isn't human, and it meant so much to have Dr. Peterson come quickly so that poor Rainy didn't have to suffer, and could pass in his home surrounded by familiar things and the people he loved.

> Dr. Anna came to our house and made a really hard day a lot easier for us and Koda. She explained everything she was going to do and put everyone at ease immediately. Koda was calm on his own bed at home. We all got to love him and be there for him right up to the end, which was the most peaceful passing I could have hoped for him. He simply and peacefully just went to sleep. She wrapped him in blankets and we put him on a stretcher and she took him with her as we had requested he be cremated. I would recommend Dr. Anna, she is kind, caring and makes a really bad day a lot better and leaves you with a peaceful feeling, you know your fur baby was in the best hands. Thank you Dr Anna for helping us make sure Koda made his transition to heaven pain and stress free. ❤️

> Dr. Anna did a wonderful job. She had a very gentle way with Samantha, my baby of 14 years. She stroked her and talked to her. Gently wrapped her in the blanket that had been hers and mine when she sat in my lap. SamE was a 65 pound lap dog for 12 of her 14 years. She was a lap dog until she could no longer climb into my lap. Dr. Anna listened to me babble and gave me Kleenex for my tears. I could not have asked for a more gentle passing for our baby. Anyone who uses Dr. Anna’s services would be very pleased.

She came to our home and treated Akora with such dignity, patience, and kindness, allowing her to pass in the place she was most comfortable. She explained every step with calm reassurance, never rushed us, and held space for our grief in a way that felt deeply human. Her presence brought comfort during a moment that could have been overwhelming and traumatic, and instead felt tender, respectful, and loving. I am grateful to Dr. Peterson for helping Akora cross with peace and grace, and for showing such care.

She gave us space and time as we needed during the process. She was very respectful and compassionate and reassured me that I was making the right decision for our dog. And we were comfortable in our own environment and Zeus didn’t have the added stress of being brought into a vets office.

> Dr. Anna was very supportive and kind to us when we decided to let my best friend Pedro go. She came on time, was well prepared, listened carefully to his health history and was very reassuring that we were doing the right thing. She was patient and gave us lots of privacy when we needed it. It’s the worst task ever, but she comes with a compassionate heart and a calming demeanor. We were so grateful to be able to give him a kind goodbye at home with us and the whole process was very simple to book online.

> Though are meeting with Dr. Peterson was under heartbreaking circumstances since she was going to perform euthanasia on our ailing dog, she made it as bearable as possible. She was right on time, not too early or late, which was good. She was very compassionate and was willing to answer any questions. She spoke as if our dog was the greatest and was so kind to him. I would highly recommend her services.

> I cannot say enough positive things about Dr. Anna Peterson. She was so kind, compassionate, and patient throughout the whole process. It takes a special soul to do what she does. Having said goodbye to several pets in my lifetime, I won’t do it any other way. Thank you Dr. Peterson and codapet for what you do.

> Dr. Peterson was the perfect person to help euthanize our beloved Daisy. The process of applying for a home appointment online was seamless. I was instantly contacted through e-mail and able to ask questions about the stages we were going through as Daisy was failing. Gave all of us comfort and peace of mind while our hearts were breaking. I ultimately requested that perhaps she could come even sooner than our designated appointment, and she was able to accommodate us. She was kind, deeply compassionate and committed to helping us and Daisy through the process. She explained in detail the steps that would be taken to release Daisy from her struggles. She helped us provide the best possible passing for our sweet girl. She let us take all the time we needed to say our goodbyes. There was no pressure to buy anything we didn’t want, but choices were offered. Pricing is comparable to what we paid a decade ago and Dr. Peterson drove quite a ways. Cannot thank her enough! I would recommend no other.

> When no forewarning that much, I had to make the decision to end my dogs life via euthanasia. That time, that decision, one of the most difficult times in my life. It wasn't going to be easy, to make an appointment and get to the vet, especially being paralyzed/disabled. I found coda and reached out to them. After some brief paperwork, the doctor was at my house later that evening. She was wonderful, which was much needed and wanted in such a horrible time. The doctor was very knowledgeable, kind, and reassured us many times that we were doing the right thing. That helped us all a lot. The fact that my family, and myself, could spend the last moments with my dog in our home where my dog was more comfortable was incredible. The fact that a company, a veterinarian, would come to our house and help out in these difficult times was appreciated by us all. I highly recommend the usage of this company and doctors. It is truly an amazing service that I will always be grateful for.

> Myself and my husband had been discussing Charlie’s quality of life for a few days and on Sunday morning we knew it needed to be scheduled as soon as possible. We were able to schedule with Dr. Anna Peterson on Sunday afternoon. Neither of us had been with a pet during Euthanasia and had no idea what to expect. I had been crying for previous 48 hours. Dr. Peterson was a gift to our family. Having an at home option in rural MN was the best thing we could do for our sweet boy. I have felt such relief knowing he passed comfortably at home. Thank you from the Anderson Family!

> She was wonderful. Very kind and compassionate during such an emotionally devastating day for us. She waited for us to be ready to say goodbye to our dog Luna and didn’t rush us. She explained what was going to happen and what to expect. I am so thankful that Luna got to spend her final moments at home with us where she was comfortable and with her family.

This was one of the hardest days of my life and I'm greatful my Reina got to pass at home in her favorite spot not at the vet where she was stressed. I will miss my dog forever 😢 💔

> Dr.Peterson was such a blessing to have during our last moments with our pup. She made us feel very comfortable off the bat. She guided us through such a hard situation. I never felt rushed and she really took the time to know us as a family unit. I can tell she is well experienced and compassion driven. I would recommend her to anyone!

> I'm so glad I heard about Coda Pets. I was worried Minnesota Pets doesn't serve the Arrowhead region anymore, we had them 5 yrs ago for Doras mom Loki. There's no way I'd bring my dog to a vet clinic to say goodbye. And the one vet that comes out, I've had bad experiences with and was dreading to support them. Doras passing was holy as I got to spoon her and grieve. I arranged for Furever Love to come later so I had time to anoint her body. I barely remember Anna being here, I was out of my mind. , she was kind and respectful. I will tell everyone that has to make this decision about Coda Pets...

> Dr. Anna Peterson is one of the most compassionate people we have ever met. Our hearts are broken with the loss of our 9 1/2 year old English Mastiff, Lilly, however, Dr. Peterson was amazing and braved a snow storm on a Sunday to help our baby cross the rainbow bridge. It was such a sad, yet beautiful experience to be able to let our girl go on her favorite spot on our couch, with no pain, no fear, just her humans there to hug and talk to her. I recommend Dr. Peterson to everyone I talk to in the sad event they need to assist their fur baby. Thank you, from the bottom of our hearts. Our Lilly came home to us a couple of days ago in a beautiful cedar box and perfectly made paw print. Thank you, again.

> Dr. Anna Peterson, DVM has so much compassion for both animals and humans. She brings her perfect blend of professionalism and loving kindness into your home. Our sweet cat had nothing but the most peaceful and stress free passing. We could not have asked for a better way to say goodbye, and we feel so good knowing that she had the best last day we could have ever given her. We are very grateful for the experience we received with Dr. Peterson and CodaPet. Thank you for providing this beautiful service to pet owners.

> Dr. Peterson was a godsend during a difficult time. She came all the way to our cabin, over 2 hours from her home, allowing us to have our dog Leo rest peacefully and not have to get in the car at the end of his life. She made herself available ahead of the appointment when an unexpected issue came up. She truly went above and beyond to make a difficult time more bearable. Thank you, Dr. Peterson!

> It takes a very special person to come into your home and handle a families grieving of losing their pet. There are many words that describe Dr. Anna...... She is very friendly, caring,compassionate, thoughtful and obviously a pet lover. Our decision was extremely difficult but she eased our pain. We know our dog Harie is in a better place and we thank Dr. Anna for being part of our journey.

> Words cannot express how thankful I am for Dr. Anna Peterson and her empathy and compassionate care for our almost 14 year-old lab Spud. This was my first dog and my husband’s first experience being present during pet euthanasia. It was important to us that our kids (ages 3 and 5) were present as well. Dr. Peterson treated Spud with the utmost care and kindness during his last moments. She was clear in explaining the process and worked with efficiency, but it was all done with such compassion that it never felt rushed. She was also amazing with the kids—answering their (seemingly unending!) questions in ways that they could understand. Highly recommend her for anyone with a companion animal who’s reached end-of-life.

> Dr. Anna did a wonderful job. She had a very gentle way with Samantha, my baby of 14 years. She stroked her and talked to her. Gently wrapped her in the blanket that had been hers and mine when she sat in my lap. SamE was a 65 pound lap dog for 12 of her 14 years. She was a lap dog until she could no longer climb into my lap. Dr. Anna listened to me babble and gave me Kleenex for my tears. I could not have asked for a more gentle passing for our baby. Anyone who uses Dr. Anna’s services would be very pleased.

> Dr. Anna was absolutely amazing in every single way! This was the first time I’d ever been in a position to choose when to say goodbye, and although it was by FAR the most difficult thing I’ve ever had to do in my whole entire life, Dr. Anna helped me tremendously and she made the whole process as peaceful and as simple as it could possibly be. No words could ever describe how deeply caring, thoughtful and understanding she was throughout the whole entire process. I cannot possibly thank her enough for making our sudden and heartbreaking goodbye as peaceful as one could ever hope for.

> She was so kind and calm, walked us through everything and gave us the time we needed at every step. Having to say goodbye was really hard, but being able to have them be where they were most comfortable and being able to grieve at home helped immensely. We hope we don't have to use her services again for a very long time, but would do so in a heartbeat.

> We are so grateful for Dr. Peterson's expertise and her kind heart! After being told by another vet we needed to put down our kitty, we arranged for Dr. Peterson to come to our home. I don't expect this to be the case that often with these types of things, but lucky for us Dr Peterson has had many years of experience as a GP and seen it all. She examined our kitty Ginger, and to our surprise and relief, Dr Peterson informed us that though Ginger is indeed sick and we don't know when she's going to go, she's not suffering, or in pain or "starving to death" as the other vet put it. We adjusted Ginger's dosage for her meds and she responded well and has been living her best Kitty life for the past two weeks and has even had some improvement. She wouldn't be here right now if it wasn't for Dr. Peterson. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts!

> I can't express enough how grateful I am to Dr. Anna L. Peterson. My cat Korra deteriorated faster than expected and when I reached out to Dr. Peterson to move up our appointment time she responded right away and was at my door in under an hour. Upon arrival she immediately jumped into action and provided Korra the relief she needed. She was kind, respectful, professional and made one of my hardest days a bit easier. I would recommend her to anyone looking for in-home pet euthanasia in the Superior WI area.

> We are very thankful to CodaPet and Dr. Anna Peterson. Dr. Anna came to our home on a sleeting, cold night to help us say goodbye Bella. Dr. Anna was gentle and kind. She took her time and gave Bella a sedative before the injection. Bella, who had suffered so much, went to sleep peacefully, in my arms, in her own home. For such a painful event, Dr. Anna did everything she could to ease our girl's passing. WELL WORTH EVERY PENNY.
