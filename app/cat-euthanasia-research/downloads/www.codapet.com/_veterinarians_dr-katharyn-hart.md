Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I decided that becoming a vet was my calling at a very young age after I became obsessed with horses, cats, and dogs. I determined early on that becoming a vet would be the best way to spend my days with animals. As a veterinarian, I have had the opportunity to euthanize my own animals at home and felt like that was the best gift I could give them. Knowing how much it meant to my own pets helped me to realize the importance of giving pets a peaceful passing at home.

> Dr. Hart was great and the experience could not have been more peaceful. This was a very painful day for me but Dr. Hart did not rush me and I had plenty of time to comfort my baby and say goodbye. She explained the process and told me what she was doing and what to expect for each step. I highly recommend her and it was worth every penny to be able to give my girl a peaceful passing.

> We needed to say goodbye to our 13.5 y/o dog, Chloe, at home. She declined very quickly between Christmas & NY & could no longer walk. We were afraid the holiday would cause delays, & didn't want her to suffer. CodaPet made the process much easier by having Vet credentials & appt times posted. Hard as it is to say goodbye, doing so at home was so much better. Dr. Katharyn Hart was extremely professional, patient, & compassionate. Highly recommend this service.

> She was perfect during my most painful crisis. I couldn't even look at her when she arrived. I opened the door to let her in, locked myself in my office where I fell asleep crying and she took care of everything without making me witness images I would never be able to erase. She was professional, non judgemental and empathetic which is exactly what I needed at the time.

> I was so grateful to find Dr. Hart and be able to book an appointment same day. My Cat of 12 beautiful years Meow Meow had been ill and our vet was unable to find out what was causing his illness. I cannot express how grateful I am to have been able to welcome her into our home to lay him to rest rather than taking him to the vet for his final moments. I did not feel judged for crying, she explained everything every step of the way and made sure that Meow Meow was comfortable with her as well before going through with the service. She allowed me to place him in transport myself and even let me walk out to the car to say goodbye before taking him. If you are looking for a peaceful passing with your fur baby I recommend Dr. Hart. I cannot thank her enough for being there for us.

> Dr. Hart was amazing! They were compassionate, empathetic, and non-judgmental. They let me know what ever step of the process was going to be before anything was done, asked if I had questions along the way, and reaffirmed what we were going to do next before we did it. They engaged me in conversation at my pace and I did not feel rushed at all through the processes. We only took the next step when I felt me and my fur baby were ready. You will be absolutely lucky if Dr. Hart comes to your home to assist you and your fur baby in their passing.

> Dr. Hart was wonderful and handled all my young kids curious questions. I was torn on my kids, 6 and 8, being present and just taking him to a vet but so glad I did it at our home as they were able to say their final goodbyes. I can’t imagine just putting him in the car and leaving and coming back home and then having to deal with all those questions myself. Thank you again!!!

> Saying goodbye to a furry family member is NEVER easy. Being able to allow them to go without suffering in the comfort of their home is amazing. Dr. Hart was very professional and friendly and was able to make this event much easier. The price is nearly the same as taking the fur baby to a facility, which makes it affordable, private and very comfortable. I recommend CodaPet (Dr. Hart) when the time comes to say goodbye to your fur babies. Thank You, Dr. Hart

> I can’t thank Dr Hart enough for coming to my house on a weekend evening to help our Kodi cross the rainbow bridge. When I first contacted the service they were extremely informative and empathetic. I was able to get an appointment time within 24 hours and they did a great job keeping me informed until they arrived. Dr Hart was compassionate and professional. Having her come to our home allowed Kodi to remain comfortable in his safe environment until the very end. I highly recommend their service to anyone who unfortunately has to experience their fur baby’s passing.

> Unfortunately we had to use this service twice in a short amount of time. Dr. Katharyn Hart was our first caregiver for our boy, Wrango and Dr. Lori Thomas was our caregiver for our old gal, Shyloh. They both showed an amazing amount of compassion with our pups, were patient with us as we went through the experience and were so thoughtful in answering any questions we had. They both made the experience very peaceful for all involved and though we were/are heartbroken, knowing that our pups were in the hands of these 2 vets, made it a bit better.
