# Creating Loving Final Moments with Your Pet at Home

Pet Loss

Saying goodbye to a beloved pet is never easy, but choosing in-home euthanasia allows you to create a peaceful, loving environment for their final moments. From sitting quietly together to involving family or choosing a meaningful setting, these small acts can bring comfort to your pet and healing to you. Most importantly, your presence is the greatest gift you can offer as they make their transition. 

When you’ve made the decision to schedule an at-home euthanasia appointment through CodaPet, you are giving your pet one of the greatest gifts possible: peace, comfort, and dignity in the place they feel most safe and loved.

As a grief counselor here in San Diego, I often sit with pet parents as they reflect on those final hours before their beloved companion passed. The most common theme I hear is: _“What could I have done differently, better, or more?”_

While every goodbye is deeply personal, I want to share some supportive options to consider in the time you have after scheduling your appointment and before the doctor arrives. These moments are precious, and how you spend them can bring both comfort to your pet and healing to you and your family.

## **Option 1: Be present, not busy**

It’s very natural to want to distract yourself during the waiting period. Many people keep busy with chores: dishes, tidying, or checking things off a list; because the weight of what’s about to happen feels overwhelming. But this is not the time to do the dishes.

Instead, allow yourself to simply sit with your pet. Pet them, hold their paw, talk to them, whisper the words they’ve always known from you: “Good boy,” “Good girl,” “I love you.” In my work with grieving pet parents, one of the most common regrets I hear is, _“I wish I had spent more time focusing on my pet instead of distracting myself with things that didn’t matter.”_ Your presence is the greatest gift you can give.

## **Option 2: Let music hold the space**

Sometimes, words aren’t enough, or are too difficult to find. Music has a way of holding us when language can’t. Playing a song that reminds you of your pet, one you used to sing or listen to together, can bring comfort.

For some families, it’s a favorite road trip playlist; for others, it might be soft, soothing sounds or even frequencies designed to calm pets (many are available on YouTube). Allowing music to fill the space can help you and your pet connect in a wordless, heart-centered way.

## **Option 3: Involve the whole family**

Grief affects everyone differently, and not all family members will feel comfortable expressing themselves in the same way. Giving the option for everyone to participate in saying goodbye can be incredibly healing.

You might gather together around your pet, share memories, say “thank you,” or simply rest your hands on them as a sign of love. Some may prefer to be quiet, while others want to speak aloud. There is no right or wrong way, only what feels authentic. Creating this space ensures that no one feels left out of the process of honoring your pet.

## **Option 4: Choose a peaceful setting**

One of the most beautiful aspects of choosing at-home euthanasia with CodaPet is the ability to decide _where_ your pet crosses over. Unlike the sterile, unfamiliar environment of a veterinary clinic, you can select a meaningful, comfortable space: whether it’s a favorite sunlit spot in the yard, a doorway with a gentle breeze, or their cozy bed.

This choice can make an enormous difference in your pet’s sense of peace. At the same time, I want to gently acknowledge that the place where they pass may later feel emotionally triggering. This is a normal part of grief, and it’s one of the reasons pet loss counseling can be so helpful to process those emotions and find completion around them.

## **Option 5: Stay with them through the transition**

This is perhaps the most difficult, but also the most meaningful, option I share with families. When the doctor administers the medication, I encourage you, if you can find the strength, to stay present with your pet. Lay beside them, stroke their fur, look into their eyes, and speak to them as they make their transition.

Yes, it can be painful to witness, but remember: for your pet, _you are their rock._ You have been their source of safety, comfort, and unconditional love their entire life. In their final moments, when the world may feel uncertain, your presence reassures them. Staying with them as they pass can be a profound act of compassion and love… one last gift you give them in return for all they’ve given you.

## **A final note**

No matter how you choose to spend these last moments, please remember: there is no perfect way to say goodbye. You are doing your best out of love, and your pet knows that. Allow yourself to be present, to feel, and to honor the bond you’ve shared.

If you find yourself struggling after the goodbye, know that support is available. Grief counseling designed for pet parents can help you process emotions, release regrets, and move toward a sense of peace.

Your love has been the constant in your pet’s life and it will remain their legacy in yours.
