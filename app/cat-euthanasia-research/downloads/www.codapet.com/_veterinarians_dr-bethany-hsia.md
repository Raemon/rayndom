Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I've gravitated towards helping pet parents and their pets in their last moments. Growing up, I had many childhood pets and occasionally tended to injured wildlife. The ability to calm and comfort animals seemed to come naturally. I believe a peaceful passing is the last gift we give our pets and that it’s a gift best given at home. In my spare time, I enjoy reading and running, although my favorite time is spent together with her husband and their young children.

> I sincerely appreciate Dr Bethany . Deciding when to let go of a pet due an incurable illness is not an easy thing. Dr. Bethany took the time to explain everything to us and was very gentle handling our chloe . She allowed us time to be with chloe and we felt at peace with the decision. Thank you Dr Bethany !

> Dr. Bethany Hsia, Is a considerate and compassionate vet. She took her time with us and explained the process of euthanizing our precious Whiteface (border collie) as sad as this process of life is, she helped us make it easier to say goodbye to Whiteface. We were glad that Whiteface did not have to suffer anymore. We will definitely be using her again and referring her to our family and friends. Thank you again Dr. Bethany Hsia. The Silva Farm

> Dr. Hsia was wonderfully understanding and informative. I’ve never had to do anything like this before and was very anxious, but she talked me through everything and was very kind. She was also very sweet with my old man in his final moments. I really appreciate the care she put in to ensuring my old man crossed over peacefully.

> Dr. Bethany made a very difficult experience so much easier. We can’t adequately thank her enough for treating not only our precious girl with such gentleness and compassion but being so thoughtful of us and our needs as well. I pray it’s a very long time before we have to face this again but we would absolutely call CodaPet.
