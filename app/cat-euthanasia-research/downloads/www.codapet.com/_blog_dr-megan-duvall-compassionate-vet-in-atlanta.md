At CodaPet, we believe every pet deserves care that honors its unique spirit, especially during life’s hardest transitions. [Dr. Megan Duvall](https://www.codapet.com/veterinarians/dr-megan-duvall) brings over two decades of veterinary experience and a deeply compassionate approach to helping families navigate these moments with grace and dignity.

## A Vet with a Genuine Curiosity and a Big Heart

From her childhood days playing “veterinarian” with friends’ pets and a trusty VW Rabbit, Dr. Duvall’s love for animals has been a lifelong journey. She grew up in the DC suburbs of Maryland and began her academic path at the University of Georgia, earning her Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from the Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine in 2003. Her career has been richly varied—including internships in small animal, emergency, and even zoo medicine—with a unique chapter helping launch the Georgia Aquarium.

Yet, what stands out most is Dr. Duvall’s authentic connection to the families and pets she serves. She’s a talkative introvert who thrives in the company of animals and believes every veterinary visit is a partnership where listening, respect, and compassion take center stage.

## Why In-Home Euthanasia in Atlanta?

After 22 years in veterinary medicine, Dr. Duvall has witnessed the emotional toll the profession can take. While many veterinarians experience compassion fatigue, she describes her own compassion as boundless. This strength inspired her to focus on in-home euthanasia, providing pets with a peaceful, gentle goodbye surrounded by the comforts of home and loved ones.

“It’s one of the hardest decisions pet families face,” she says. “But it’s also an act of love—giving our pets a calm, peaceful passing is a final gift we can offer them.”

Dr. Duvall sees her role as helping families reframe these difficult moments, supporting them without judgment or fear.

## A Philosophy Rooted in Empathy

Dr. Duvall’s care philosophy is simple but powerful: making an inevitable part of life as meaningful and beautiful as possible.

“While euthanasia is heartbreaking, it’s also part of the deep love we have for our pets,” she shares. “We are privileged to help make that experience peaceful, respectful, and compassionate.”

Beyond her work with pets and families, Dr. Duvall’s life is enriched by her furry companions—Banjo, a German Shepherd-Husky mix; Willow, a playful Husky-Boxer-Dachshund blend; and Delilah, their mischievous cat.

## Life Beyond the Clinic

When she’s not caring for pets, Dr. Duvall enjoys a full life in [Decatur, Georgia](https://www.codapet.com/cities/atlanta-ga), a vibrant community known for its arts and music scene. She enjoys horseback riding, yoga, crafting, and following the local theater community, where her oldest son is an actor. This rich community life feeds her compassion and energy, evident in her veterinary care.
