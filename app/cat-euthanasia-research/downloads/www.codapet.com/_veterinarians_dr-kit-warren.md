Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

My passion for wildlife and conservation is what lead me to the path of becoming a veterinarian, but over time my love for small animal medicine became my priority. Over my career, I have enjoyed many aspects of veterinary medicine, but I have come to really value how special it is when I am able to spend those final moments with a pet and their people. It is an honor to assist in bringing comfort and to help ease pain during a very difficult time. When I have been able to offer these services in the comfort of a pet's home, it is made much sweeter knowing that the pet is not in a unfamiliar or fearful place. After these experiences, I had a desire to make access to this kind care a priority.

> Dr. Warren came in like an angel and helped us get our sweet pet peacefully to sleep. He explained the process well and was thorough answering all our questions. He was gentle to our beloved pet and he was patient with us. He gave us time and space to talk and grieve this most heartbreaking time in our family. I would recommend him to anyone considering end of life care at home for their special pet.

> He was very kind and professional and made a hard day a little easier. Not having to put my beloved cat in a carrier and have him be upset and stressed at the end of his life was the right decision. Dr Warren also gave us time alone after the procedure so it wasn’t rushed.

> Codapet was the best choice we made to help our pet at the end of his life. Dr. Warren was so helpful in every aspect of the procedure in telling me what was going to happen and what to expect. He told us to take as much time as we need and sat on the floor with us and just talked. Our little man went peacefully in my lap as we were petting him and talking to him. It couldn't have been more comforting to know he was not scared and we were all there in our home at the end. Thank you so much Dr. Warren!

> This decision is never easy, but Dr. Warren made this such a peaceful and loving experience. From the initial text the night before, through the kind and gentle explanations, and his care and compassion during the procedure, Dr. Warren made this experience as easy as it could be, and I am forever grateful. He allowed us to move at our own pace, never making us feel rushed during the process, and he even sent us a symphony card with a nose and paw print. If you are struggling with this decision, as I was, and if you are putting it off, as I was, I would highly recommend utilizing Dr. Warren's services.

> While this was one of the hardest things I have had to do in quite some time, Dr. Warren made this experience easier for us as a family and for Lacie. Having him come to our home and her not be nervous and apprehensive, was comforting. It also gave us the ability to grieve in privacy. I would recommend this to other pet owners. Thank you, Dr. Warren for your kindness.

> We were very, very pleased with Dr. Warren. It was a difficult time for us, and Dr. Warren demonstrated professionalism, understanding, and empathy. In our final moments with Ellie Mae, he treated her as if she was his own. In the days following, he sent emails and a hand-written note with words of encouragement. Now weeks later, we still grieve and miss Ellie Mae terribly, but there is comfort in knowing that in her final moments with us, Dr. Warren treated her with the utmost respect.
