Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

A couple of years ago, I had to make the difficult decision of putting my own beloved pet to sleep because she was suffering after being hit by a car. At that moment I fully understood the sorrow and pain pet parents go through when making the same decision for their own pets. I was now on the other side, and I can fully understand that it not an easy place to be. They say you can’t understand someone until you’ve walked a mile in their shoes. This heartbreaking experience and the compassion I feel while practicing vet medicine compelled me to start helping families at the comfort of their own homes. In contrast (Unlike the) with working at busy hospitals and vet clinics where I rush through appointments, this type of work allows me to share a solemn moment with pet parents before they say their last goodbyes. Rest assured that I will be there to support you every step of the way.

## What pet parents are saying

> Dr. Lutri is truly an angel on earth. She is highly compassionate and made me and my pet feel at ease during one of the hardest moments of my life. While it is always devastating to lose a pet, she made the experience much less painful. My little pug passed very peacefully in her own home thanks to Dr. Lutri. She truly cares about her patients and pet parents and I am forever grateful for her.

We have done this with other pets but Dr. Lutri was the best. She eased Ruby to kitty heaven and kept us calm throughout the procedure. She even followed up with us a few times to make sure we were okay. And sent us a lovely sympathy card.

> I cannot express enough gratitude for the outstanding care and support provided by Dr. Lutri. From the moment I first made my inquiry, she’s been accommodating, and she had answered my questions with empathy and professionalism. She made an incredibly heartbreaking time a little more bearable. Dr. Lutri took the time to explain every step of the process, making sure to give us time to absorb what was going on. In those final moments, Dr. Lutri treated Plato with dignity and respect and at the same time, she provided me emotional support. She allowed us more than enough time to be with Plato. I am truly thankful for the compassion and kindness of Dr. Lutri. Thank you for turning that painful situation into a moment of grace and love.

> There are no words that fully capture the gratitude I feel for Dr. Daniela Lutri. During the most heartbreaking moment of my life, she showed up with an incredible amount of compassion, patience, and gentleness. She treated my sweet Harley with such dignity and respect, and she treated me with kindness when I was completely broken. Dr. Lutri took the time to explain everything, never rushed a single step, and made sure Harley was comfortable, peaceful, and surrounded by love. The calm presence she brought into my home made an unbearable situation feel just a little more humane and a little less terrifying. Saying goodbye to a soul dog is devastating, but knowing Harley passed quietly, pain-free, and in my arms is something I will forever be grateful for. Dr. Lutri gave us the gift of a peaceful goodbye, and that is something I will carry with me for the rest of my life. I cannot recommend her enough to anyone facing this impossible decision. She truly does this work from the heart.

> I knew that my Chloe was in her last days. I felt it in my gut. I did not want to take her to the vet to give her final treatment because of my 1st experience with my Zack years prior. I just remembered feeling rushed, and just empty and cold. And then feeling regret for many months afterward. So I told myself I wouldn’t take my dog to be put down ever again. However, my friend told me about in home euthanasia. Though I was still very nervous, it sounded like the best option for me and my Chloe. I was given a good referral for CodaPet and went on their website. Scheduling the appointment was seamless, and I appreciate the transparency of the pricing. I am forever thankful that I met Dr. Daniela Lutri. She spoke with so much compassion, empathy and validation through the entire process. She spoke to me about each step to be taken and what each injection was, and what to expect in Chloe’s reaction. She took her time to get to know Chloe, her history and how she came to us. She truly humanized my Chloe, and provided a heart warming presence, all the way through. Dr. Daniela was truly an Angel and Godsend: helping my Chloe cross the rainbow bridge. 🙏🏽❤️thank you, Dr. Daniela.

Although losing my little man after 20 years was gut wrenching, I cant thank you all enough for guiding me through the end of his chapter and making sure it happened with grace, sympathy, and most of all dignity. Codapet helped me to honor his passing and for that I am deeply thankful.

> When it was time to cross our beloved fur baby over, we used CodaPet. We have used another at-home pet euthanasia company, but our last experience with them was very unpleasant. Dr. Daniela Lutri came to our home and assisted our fur baby to cross over. We are deeply grateful to Dr. Lutri for the extraordinary compassion and care she provided during a difficult moment in our lives. Saying goodbye to our beloved fur baby was heartbreaking, but Dr. Lutri’s presence brought a sense of peace and dignity to the experience that we will never forget. From the moment she arrived, Dr. Lutri was kind, gentle, and incredibly patient. She took the time to ask us about our fur baby, and our fur baby’s health issues. As she became acquainted with our fur baby, she pointed out some other health issues that were obvious to her. Hearing Dr. Lutri share them with us validated that we were making the right decision. Dr. Lutri explained everything to us with tenderness and respect, allowing us to move at our own pace. Her calm and compassionate demeanor created a safe space for our family to grieve and say goodbye. The way Dr. Lutri guided our baby through her final moments was nothing short of beautiful. It was peaceful, serene, and filled with love—exactly what we had hoped for. Knowing our fur baby passed in the comfort of her home, surrounded by love and without fear, has brought us immense comfort in our grief. Dr. Lutri is truly a gift to families navigating the loss of a cherished companion. Her work is more than a service—it’s a calling, and we are forever thankful for her grace and empathy.

I didn’t know where to start so I called coda, best decision I made. Not only was it so peaceful for my dog, it was such closure for me, and done so graciously. I’m so grateful for Coda and the last memory they gave me with my boy, Kyro.

> The decision to put our beloved Rocko to rest was not easy. I don’t imagine the decision being an easy decision for anyone. However, CodaPet provided a memorable and empathetic experience from beginning to end. The scheduling of our boys rest day was hard, however, the scheduler was very empathetic and validated my feelings throughout the entire phone process. But the most truly memorable piece to our experience was the wonderful care that my family and Rocko received from Dr. Daniela Lutri. First, Dr. Lutri was very communicative and available as we awaited her arrival to our home. Upon arrival, Dr. Lutri made us feel like only our situation mattered and provided a truly specialized and focused experience. Dr. Lutri even took it upon herself to invite questions and was very caring and patient with our feelings, including to my two young nephews who were present. Dr. Lutri’s patient and loving care ensured my family that we made the right decision. We couldn’t have asked for a better experience on a difficult day. Lastly, I want to add that Dr. Lutri’s effort and care didn’t end on my baby’s rest day. Dr. Lutri remained very responsive to follow ups and followed through with our expedited want for our babies arrival back home. We highly recommend CodaPet to assist with the most compassionate farewell to your furry loved one. My family and I hope that you too receive the best care as provided by Dr. Daniela Lutri 🤍🐾

> Dr. Daniella Lutri is an Angel! I contacted her last Sunday at about 11am as we decided that morning that it was time for our Ginger girl to be euthanized. Dr. Lutri worked us into her schedule and was at our home by 4pm. She walked us through exactly what she was going to do and how we might have our other dog nearby to help her understand what was going on. Dr. Lutri took her time at each step explaining how our Ginger might react and gave us the opportunity to give her lots of love (and treats!) to help distract her and make it as easy as possible for all of us. Our Ginger girl passed in the most peaceful way laying in her bed with us around her. She felt no pain. It was by far the best way we could have ever hoped for our girl to go. We are SO GRATEFUL to Dr. Lutri. She was amazing at every step. I hope I don’t have to see her for a while but I will not hesitate to call her again when needed. Thank you so much!

> We are so grateful to Dr. Daniela for the compassionate care she provided during one of the most difficult moments a pet owner can face. Saying goodbye to Henry was heartbreaking, but having the experience at home—with someone as gentle, thoughtful, and respectful as Dr. Daniela—made all the difference. We had been through this before in a clinical setting, and the contrast was profound. Dr. Daniela was incredibly reassuring, honoring not just Henry's comfort and dignity, but she was also really in tune with all the family members who were present, making sure we were all on the same page each step of the way. It’s clear this work is her true calling. We wouldn’t hesitate to recommend her to anyone facing this painful decision.

> I can’t believe it’s been a year since my moms sweet Yokie Molly passed away. Dr. Daniela Lutri was so wonderful with helping us with knowing that we made the right decision. She came to my mom’s house and not only comforted Molly but also my mom who was taking everything the hardest. She took her time in explaining what she was going to do and even gave us as much time as we wanted with Molly before the final shot. My mom never knew when Mollys last day was going to be, so it wasn’t something that can be planned for. But Dr. Lutri was only a phone call or text away for my mom to even call with any questions until the final day had come. She is so amazing and kind. Even though it was such a hard day it was also such a great experience.

> We can’t thank Dr. Daniela enough for helping us say goodbye to our amazing boy, Apollos. He had terminal lung cancer and suddenly was struggling to breathe. We knew it was finally time to make the difficult decision to say goodbye to our best friend. We contacted Dr.Daniela after reading her amazing reviews. We wanted nothing but the best for our boy and she is it! She went above and beyond. During our appointment she immediately put our pup at ease (he took to her right away.) The entire process, while one of the most difficult decisions, was the best final gift and thank you we could’ve given our pup. Dr. Daniella never rushed us, allowing as much time as we needed through each step. And in the comfort of his home, with his favorite blanket, surrounded by so much love our boy very peacefully went to sleep. We can’t thank Dr. Daniela enough for making this unwanted journey easier to deal with. We felt like a caring friend had stepped into our home to help us through the difficult goodbye. If you’re on the fence about what to do, I pray our experience will help you make the decision to give your furry family member the best send off you possibly can.

> Daniela from CodaPet was wonderful during what was a hard time for our family. She was professional and showed knowledge of pet wellness and illness, further reassuring us of the decision we made. Putting your loved family pet down is never an easy decision, but she helped us feel confident it was the right call for Lexi who was beginning to suffer with age. Throughout the whole appointment, she put our dog first and made sure Lexi was relaxed, comfortable, and surrounded by love. Beyond that, she came into our home in what was a difficult situation and helped us during this period of grieving. I am grateful for Daniela and Codapet, and that Lexi received their care during her last moments.

> The form for the service was very easy to complete. I appreciated this since making this decision was very difficult and I was fraught with emotion. I wanted my beloved cat Buddy to have a pain free transition at our home. He was 18 years. His decline was rapid; he became extremely ill in the span of a week with advanced kidney disease. Dr. Lutri was so gentle and loving to Buddy. She explained every step of the process and asked me before each step if I was ready to move to the next. Dr. Lutri was gracious, kind, and compassionate. She has the most peaceful, calm, loving presence and a profound caring for the pets she serves and their pet guardians. She comforted me greatly as she took care of my magnificent boy. She genuinely understood the magical connection I had with Buddy and treated him so tenderly when she put his sweet body into a beautiful bed to transport him the the crematorium. I felt like Dr. Lutri was an angel sent to me in my dire time of need and loss. She was exceptional in every way. She is a talented doctor overflowing with empathy and understanding who is beautiful inside and out.

> Daniela is the most compassionate human being who happens to be a veterinarian. Animals trust her, are drawn to her because being a veterinarian is her passion, it's not just her job. All of these qualities are essential when navigating and communicating with humans the end of life decision for a beloved pet. Daniela cares equally for the pet and the pet parent. Daniela explained every step of the process to me before we began the process of saying goodbye to my beloved Romeo. Romeo passed peacefully.

> Dr Daniela was without a doubt, the sweetest, kindest, most considerate and caring vet I have ever met. It's never easy losing your "baby", but she made it so much easier than it would have been otherwise.

> Dr Daniela was awesome she took her time and explained everything every step of the way. She is so compassionate we didn’t know what to expect. We weren’t rushed. As much as it hurt me, the experience was peaceful and loving and she was so gentle with my girl.

> It took me some time to write this review, but I am immensely relieved to have found Dr. Lutri to assist with the passing of my beloved Frosty. Initially filled with fear and uncertainty, I made a same-morning appointment for 1 pm. Dr. Lutri promptly confirmed the appointment and expressed genuine concern for Frosty's well-being. Upon learning of Frosty's pain, she expedited her arrival. I'm profoundly grateful that she arrived earlier than expected, as my Frosty was suffering. Frosty was loved by so many and so I am beyond thankful to have found this at home service. Despite the sadness of the moment, it was touching to have everyone who loved my dog present to bid farewell. Dr. Lutri displayed exceptional kindness, gentleness, and patience throughout the entire process. She patiently answered our questions, explaining each step with compassion. We were all deeply appreciative to have such a caring individual attend to Frosty. I have immense respect and gratitude for Dr. Lutri. Additionally, receiving a personalized card from her was incredibly thoughtful; it moved me to tears. Thank you, Dr. Lutri, for your compassion and care during this difficult time.

> Dr. Daniela Lutri made this painful process so much easier. The minute we met her it was like we had known her for years. She is so compassionate and friendly. She gave us a big hug as soon as she walked in. We had to put down a sister and a brother 8 days apart. It was devasting but, Daniel was so comforting. She reassured us they would be out of pain and happier. Both had stopped eating and were crying from pain from their illness. She rearranged her schedule just so she could come back for our other dog 8 days after the first one. She even hand delivered both cedar boxes of ashes together. We absolutely love Daniela and she made the painful experience much bearable.
