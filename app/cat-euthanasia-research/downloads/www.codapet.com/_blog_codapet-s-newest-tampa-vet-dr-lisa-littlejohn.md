When [Dr. Littlejohn](https://www.codapet.com/veterinarians/dr-lisa-littlejohn) isn’t out on house calls or helping families say goodbye to their beloved pets with grace and compassion, she’s creating content for her [Facebook page, **The Doggy Doctor**](https://www.facebook.com/DrLisaLittlejohn/) & YouTube. Because she believes “food is love”, her goal is to make pet nutrition a lot less confusing and a lot more fun.

Dr. Littlejohn’s videos are down-to-earth, full of helpful tips, and, best of all, rooted in real veterinary expertise. Her approachable style builds trust and reassures pet parents that they get reliable advice from someone who truly cares.

In one popular video, “How to Pick Good Dog Food,” she breaks down complicated pet food labels, helping pet parents learn what ingredients to look for and which to steer clear of. It’s all about giving viewers the tools to make smart, healthy choices for their furry friends.

In “5 Fruits Safe for Dogs,” she lists human snacks your pup can enjoy (hello, blueberries!) and talks about why these natural treats can be a healthy supplement to their diet. And yes, she delivers the info with plenty of laughs and her signature sense of humor because talking about dog food _shouldn’t_ be boring.

[Dr. Littlejohn also actively supports her growing online community by providing valuable resources, including a free emergency care guide, practical OTC remedies for common pet ailments, and an Ultimate Puppy Guide that covers everything new puppy parents need to know—because, unfortunately, puppies don't come with an instruction manual.](https://stan.store/TheDoggyDoctor)

## **A Lifelong Love for Animals**

Before she was Tampa’s resident dog diet YouTuber, Dr. Littlejohn was a lifelong animal lover with a big heart and big dreams. She earned her undergraduate degree from the University of Florida in 2005, followed by her Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine from UF’s College of Veterinary Medicine in 2010.

Over the years, she’s worked in general practice and focused on end-of-life care, gaining a reputation for being compassionate, honest, and deeply respectful of the human-animal bond. That connection between pets and their people is what drives everything she does.

Dr. Lisa Littlejohn doesn’t just work with animals. She lives with them, learns from them, and loves them deeply. At the heart of her home is Colby, a spirited British yellow Lab with a big personality and an even bigger heart. Whether they’re strolling through the neighborhood or just enjoying a lazy afternoon in the sun, Colby is more than a pet, he’s family.
