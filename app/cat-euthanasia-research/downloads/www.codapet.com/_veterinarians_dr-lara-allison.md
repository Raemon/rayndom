Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

After 30 years as a veterinarian, I’ve witnessed both the clinical and the deeply personal sides of saying goodbye to a beloved pet. Through this journey, I’ve come to believe that the most peaceful and compassionate way for our pets to pass is in the comfort of their own home—or in a favorite outdoor spot—surrounded by the people who love them. My first experience with home euthanasia was 24 years ago, with my mom’s beloved dog, Smokey. We sat with him on a sunny riverbank, birds singing overhead, the wind gently moving through the trees. As my mom held him, I asked her to share memories—his funny quirks, the naughty moments, the ways he made her smile. In that space of love and remembrance, something shifted: the sadness was still there, but so was peace. Smokey passed calmly, cradled in my mom’s arms, wrapped in love and sunlight. It was a moment that changed both of us—and it’s what inspired me to dedicate my work to helping others have the same experience. Since that day, I’ve helped countless families say goodbye in the quiet, sacred space of home. The difference is profound. Without the clinical setting, there’s less fear, less anxiety—for both pets and their people. It becomes a time to focus on a life well-lived, and to offer a final gift of comfort, dignity, and love. This work is an honor. Helping families create a peaceful transition for their companions is one of the most meaningful things I’ve ever done, and I’m grateful every day to be part of such tender, important moments.

## What pet parents are saying

> Our family has been with Pet Vet for many years and has numerous pets. As pet owners know, the most difficult decision we make for our pets is knowing when to keep fighting for them or if we should allow them to be free of their pain. Our beloved GSD, Bauer, was one in a million. We brought him home shortly before our first child joined us. 12 years later, and a couple more kids, Bauer was our constant loving, best friend. We started seeing Dr. Allison regularly to help with Bauer’s joints and other ailments. We promised Bauer that we would help him in any way we could, and Dr. Allison promised our family she would let us know when it was time. We were in it together, as a team. He had such a wonderful last six months, and Dr. Allison helped him and our family along the way. We had many difficult conversations, but they were always made easier because of her ability to have an open discussion. Once Bauer’s health started to rapidly decline our family made the difficult decision, along with Dr. Allison, to help relieve his pain. When planning our final appointment, she so graciously offered to come to our home the next night after work, which just happened to be a Friday evening. We were able to take Bauer to the beach that Friday morning as a family. We had a lovely afternoon at home, while Bauer ate all of his favorite treats. As evening rolled around, we started a nice fire in our living room and made a pallet out of blankets for Bauer. Dr. Allison arrived at our home after working at the clinic all day. We were able to chat with her and hang out with Bauer. She explained the procedure and made sure we understood fully what steps she would be taking. The process was quick, and our sweet boy was no longer in pain. Dr. Allison had even called the crematorium and they were waiting outside our home for whenever we were ready. While losing a pet is never easy, being able to have the procedure done in our home with a veterinarian that loved him like their own, made it much more bearable. We will forever be thankful for Dr. Allison and her kind heart. We know it hurt her almost as much as we were hurting, but we were there together for our sweet Bauer. And he knew it too. Thank you Dr. Allison for your compassion and sincerity. We will forever be grateful that you helped us ensure Bauer had a wonderful life and a gracious passing.

Being able to do this at home where Daisy was most comfortable gave us an opportunity to say goodbye in our time on our own terms. Dr.Lara talked us through every step with compassion and love. She took care of everything from beginning to end and made this process much easier. She is not only a wonderful vet but a wonderful person and we were so thankful to have her there.

> When my beloved dog was diagnosed with a terminal illness, I was devastated and unsure of how to handle her final moments. When the time arrived, Dr. Lara Allison came to my home and provided the most compassionate and professional care I could have hoped for. Her calm demeanor and gentle approach immediately put both my dog and me at ease during such a difficult time. Dr. Allison's expertise was evident as she handled everything with the utmost care, allowing my dog to pass peacefully in the comfort of her own home. The love and compassion she showed were truly remarkable, and I will forever be grateful for her support during one of the hardest days of my life. Dr. Allison’s new mobile home euthanasia practice is a testament to her dedication to providing compassionate end-of-life care for animals. I wholeheartedly recommend her services to anyone in need of such care. Thank you, Dr. Allison, for your incredible kindness and professionalism.

> Our family was faced with the dilemma of a 15.5 year lab that was having extreme difficulty with daily life. Her biggest fear in life was a trip to the vet. Seeking alternatives, we searched for in home euthanasia options. We selected Dr Lara Allison from all her great reviews. She lived up to her reputation. When she arrived, she not only cared for the family, but was very intent on making our pet at ease. She is a very caring person. Saying goodbye to a loving pet is one of the most difficult things people face, and while it isn't easy, Dr Allison showed she cared. Thank you for being a special person.

Her presence turned what could have been a cold and clinical experience into something tender, humane, and full of love. We will forever be thankful for the way Dr. Lara helped Annie pass peacefully, in the comfort of her home, surrounded by those who loved her most.

> I recently had to make the heartbreaking decision to help my beloved, 17-year-old kitty, Alice, go over the Rainbow Bridge. I am so grateful that my vet recommended in-home pet euthanasia and Dr. Lara Allison of CODApet. Dr. Lara was so wonderful through the entire process. She was so compassionate, kind, and empathetic, gently guiding me through the process and giving me all the time I needed during each step. She was so thoughtful, wanting to hear all about Alice’s life. She even sent a hand-written card and a sweet memento of Alice that I will treasure. I am so grateful that Alice’s final journey did not involve another scary trip in a carrier and a car. She was in her happy and safe place at home, and she passed gently and peacefully in my arms. If you are ever faced with this heartbreaking decision, I would highly recommend in-home pet euthanasia, and I would absolutely recommend Dr. Lara Allison. I cannot possibly say enough good things about Dr. Lara and her compassionate and loving care. I am forever grateful to her. If I ever have to make this choice again, I definitely will be contacting CODApet and Dr. Lara. Thank you, Dr. Lara! Jennifer E.

> Though we may not have control of when we say goodbye to our animals, we sometimes have the choice as to where and with whom we will face this impossibly hard decision. I grew up with dogs my whole life, welcoming many into my family and was fortunate enough to also be there at the end of their time on Earth. The bond I had with Bruce (the first dog that was really just mine, after college) was and remains one of the most important, special connections I will ever have the pleasure of experiencing. A trusted friend, life coach, and confidant, Lara extended her in-home euthanasia services to me when Bruce could no longer enjoy his life. It was emotional and scary as I wondered if I was doing the right thing. She comforted me and stood by me, supporting my decision. She carefully explained the process- what would happen before, during, and after - leaving out anything too overwhelming or unnecessary for me to know. She performed the service in my home and handled Bruce’s cremation for me as well. Bruce passed away peacefully in the comfort of his favorite chair. Admittedly, this testimonial is difficult to write as it conjures a painful memory, but I often reflect on how much more discomfort I would have experienced having to take him to a sterile, foreign environment in order to say goodbye to my best friend. Lara was calm, collected, kind, and invaluable in making the entire situation much more palatable for me, and for Bruce. His and my comfort were of utmost importance. It is impossible to imagine having to go through that event in any other way. My new dog has taught me how to love again, and with that, we've created a special, different kind of bond - one that I never thought I could have after losing Bruce. He’s stable, but suffering from cardiomyopathy and has limited time left earthside. I know one day, maybe sooner than I would like, I will have to make another hard choice. I rest easy and find peace knowing that when it is his time to transition into another realm, Lara will be there, in the comfort of our home, Gus on his favorite chair, getting the best pets and receiving all the love he deserves. I cannot recommend Lara enough - her heart is SO big - the service she provides is complicated, necessary, and special. In my opinion, she is the perfect person for this difficult job.

> Our family was heartbroken when our beloved English bulldog, Cowboy, received the diagnosis of canine lymphoma. Dr. Lara Allison was there for him and for us during and after the many weeks of chemotherapy. She saw Cowboy when he was in remission, and she checked on him often by phone. When the cancer eventually came back, Dr. Lara worked with us to provide the best palliative care for Cowboy. It gave us great comfort to see that he was comfortable and happy in those last few weeks. When we knew the time was near, Dr. Lara offered to come to our home, where Cowboy was most comfortable, to help him on his final journey to the rainbow bridge. We highly recommend Dr. Lara Allison for pet parents seeking compassionate in-home care.

> We had Lucy, a rescue that we adopted when she was 10 months old. She was a great family pet. She found her forever home. Our two young children grew up with her. And still talk about her today. After 13 years as a family member, because of medical reasons, we knew that it was time to let Lucy go. We decided that it would be better for Lucy to be in our own home as opposed to a cold clinic. Dr Allison came over to our house to perform the procedure. It was the best situation it could have been. Because Lucy was in her own surroundings, she was relaxed and not stressed. Dr Allison not only took care of Lucy, she had compassion with the humans as well. The time she took with us was priceless. She explained what was happening and did not rush our grieving. We have all heard that hindsight is 20/20. And clearly this was the best way to handle an emotional situation.

> As a first time dog owner, when we unfortunately got to the point where end of life was a reality for Arnold (our 13 year old Olde English Bulldog), the thought of when, where and how to experience that situation was super overwhelming. Thankfully we had Dr. Allison to shepherd us through that process to allow us to make the right decision at the right time, while experiencing those last final moments and memories in the comfort of our home (vs. in a waiting room where our dog also became anxious and nervous). Her genuine care and thoughtfulness of not only our dog, but with us made a dreaded situation as manageable and convenient as possible for us. We can't imagine anyone being a more perfect fit for professionally and gracefully handling such an emotional situation.

> We had an absolutely amazing experience with Dr. Allison. We called her to our home to meet with our cat who has a terminal illness- to help guide us in next steps. We went over our cat’s current medical regimen, bloodwork numbers, etc. It’s important to us that our cat enjoys quality of life for as long as possible. Dr. Allison displayed not only her knowledge of veterinary medicine, she also showed us kindness, compassion and empathy. Our very shy cat was drawn to her immediately, and we were all able to take part in a spiritual healing. Although we know our cat’s prognosis is bleak, Dr. Allison offered a new perspective for all of us, and we are beyond grateful. When the time comes to make a hard decision, we know who we will call, but Dr. A offers so much more to our family. She’s been a blessing.

> Dr. Lara was the most compassionate, kind and loving person I could have ever had come to my home to help my fur baby, Maddi Sofia, cross the Rainbow Bridge. She was helpful from the very beginning throughout the entire process and even weeks later. It was such a hard decision to make but she helped to comfort us to know we were doing the right thing at the right time. She treated Maddi with so much love and was even wonderful with my other dog. She went above and beyond to make sure she was happy and could have some food experiences that dogs can't have for their entire lives because they can become ill. She explained the entire process and what was going to happen and the steps that would be taken to ensure Maddi was brought back to us in the most humane way possible. I highly recommend Dr Lara to anyone who is in need of this kind of service. While it was very sad, it was also beautiful at the same time to know our Baby Girl could pass at home in our arms with love instead of having to be in a clinical setting surrounded by people she didn't know. Thank you Dr. Lara. You are an amazing human being and I thank you for being there for our family. ❤️

> We recently had to make the heartbreaking decision to say goodbye to our beloved dog, Fritz. Dr. Allison treated us and our pet with the utmost compassion, respect, and kindness. She gave us time, comfort, and space to say goodbye, and explained everything gently so we knew what to expect. It was one of the hardest moments of our lives, but we are forever grateful for the care and dignity she provided. I would highly recommend Dr. Allison to anyone needing support during such a difficult time.

> In posting a review, I wanted to tell my story of never having a dog and the pain of letting her go and how the Lord chose Dr. Lara to mercifully end her life for me. But all I could come up with, were my words. But then He spoke to me! And it was a message I hear always when I'm searching. He who has Christ, has no fear. In a sermon, He sent a message from Luke 12:22-34 The end of anxiety. Dr. Lara was a gift that day because of her Faith. She had no fear that day! My only hope is, that in some small way I was able to thank her graciously enough! To Maggie Mae, my beautiful Boo boo, Rest in Peace 🙏 I love you. 🐕

> Yesterday on 9/11/24 I thought I was going to have to say "goodbye" to my beloved 9 year old Shih Ztu Tucker after he had a severe reaction to a medication and he spent two days in the hospital and his liver enzymes were extremely high. I wrestled with this decision for days but I wanted him to pass peacefully in the comfort of his home and in my arms not some cold steel table among strangers. Dr. Lara was so kind, compassionate and had such a calming demeanor and I had already paid for all the arrangements prior to her arrival. She did a complete assessment of Tucker and told me he still had the will to live, his eyes looked good, his teeth and he was still showing signs of life and she felt with time the liver enzymes and damage could regenerate itself and went into great detail. Dr. Lara even called him in a prescription that she could legally do and recommended some "brick & mortar" vet facilities she highly recommended to take my beloved dog to for a second opinion and didn't charge me for anything but a consultation charge! I will forever be grateful because she also offered me hope. I can't emphasize enough just how much this meant to my husband and I and we will forever be grateful. Dr. Lara truly has a calling and a zen like aura about her. I told her to take this as a compliment she ranks right up there with Dr. Pol! When it truly is time for my boy she will be who I call. I'd give her 10 stars ⭐️ if I could.

> Dr. Lara Allison is truly an angel on earth when it comes to the difficult task of putting down your pet. When our beloved cat had gotten too ill to live comfortably, we decided to put him to sleep. She came to our home, embraced and supported us in our sadness, and painlessly administered the medication to end his suffering. I can't give enough praise for her and what she does . Home euthanasia is absolutely the way to go about this tough situation and she's the best.

> Dr Lara helped make our in-home pet euthanasia as good as could be expected. It’s such a hard decision but my sweet boy got to roll in the grass one more time. I knew it was the right thing for him. And then he went to sleep in our backyard in my lap, one of his happy places.

> Dr. Laura Allison, with CodaPet, assisted our family recently with the passing of our dear Daisy. She gave our family and Daisy the upmost care. She gave us as much time as we needed for each step and she was very communicative about each step that she was going to do and as she was doing each step. She treated our baby like her own and we appreciate everything that she did for our Daisy and our family. Daisy was 14 and had the best life with us. We will miss her dearly.

> My husband and I cannot thank Dr Allison enough for the comfort, care and compassion that she brought to our home that day. The service she provides allowed my sweet cat, Opie, to cross the rainbow bridge in my arms in the bedroom where he had slept for most of his life. Dr Allison explained thoroughly each step of the procedure as well as Opie’s response so well that I actually felt comfortable participating in his transition. Opie never seemed to be stressed or uncomfortable. He seemed to be at peace, as was I. I recommend highly Dr Lara Allison for end of life/transition care.

> When Bootsie was unable to control her bladder, at age 14, we knew it was time. Having had my first lab euthanized at the vets office many years before , I knew that wasn’t what I wanted for my Bootsie. We reached out to Dr Lara and she was able to come to our house. There was something very calming and very natural about the whole experience. Dr Lara explained everything to me in detail. Bootsie was able to lie on her bed in her favorite spot and very peacefully go to sleep. It was only a few short months later that her littermate, Beauregard was ready to leave us. Dr Lara was there for us again. It’s so hard to lose your fur babies. Im so grateful that there is a service that can treat you and your fur baby with so much kindness and so much compassion. Thank you Dr. Lara.

> My family and I will be forever grateful for Dr. Lara's compassion in our hour of need. She informed us of the entire process when she arrived, in addition to answering several questions over text that I had leading up to our appointment. We loved the way she kept asking about our pup's life with us, keeping the sole focus in the room on the love and light that he brought into our home in the last decade. It really was a beautiful experience, to say goodbye in the comfort Lando's favorite spot at the front window, with the family gathered. Thank you so much, Dr. Lara. It takes a special person to step into this occupation, and you not only do you offer the service, but you go above and beyond with it.

> Dr. Lara was with Chewbacca and me on the worst day of our lives. She treated Chewbacca with such love, dignity, and compassion. I cannot say enough great things about her. None of this is easy and will never be. Having Dr. Lara there with her care and love ensured Chewbacca had the kindest and most loving departure. Thank you so much Dr. Lara, for everything.

> Our dog unfortunately had to be put to rest Nov 14, 2024. It has taken me this long to be able to write this, due to my emotions. I wanted to thank Laura for being so compassionate during probably the toughest time in my life and guide me through. Laure was very willing to let you vacillate back and forth on decisions as most of us do in a situation like this she was willing to listen to us and our beloved family member and help us make informed thought out decisions. Our loved one got very sick in the night and Laura was here first thing to help with this situation we hoped would never come. If it had not been for Laura, I am not sure I would have any mind left. Laura helped us work through the entire process and you could tell could feel what we felt. Thank you for being there for us in our time of need. You are a true friend and am so glad you entered our life’s to help make this unbearable situation more manageable. Laura gave us a hair clipping from our loved one and he still goes with us to all of his favorite places. It helps us remember he is still with us.

> CodaPet's at-home pet euthanasia service is a highly recommended alternative to visiting a vet clinic. When faced with this difficult decision for your cherished pet, providing them the comfort of being in their own home can make all the difference. Dr. Lara Allison was exceptional—her empathy for our situation brought immense peace and comfort during this challenging time. The compassion and dedication she displays in her work truly supported us throughout the process. We cannot express enough gratitude for her kindness, caring, and professionalism.

> Dr. Allison helped our family to care for Zoie for hopefully a while longer and keep her pain controlled. Dr. Allison is calm, has great touch with animals and is very knowledgeable. From making the appoinment to meeting with her second time, she was always responding, kept in touch and followed through with all we had discussed. Thank you!

> The time had come for our 14-year-old Golden Retriever, Katie, to be put to sleep. We wanted Katie’s last moments to be at home in familiar surroundings with her family. Dr. Allison, explained the procedures and told us exactly what to expect. After giving Katie the mild sedative, Dr. Allison gently wrapped Katie into a fluffy cozy blanket and placed a blanket/pillow under her head for support. When everything was in place, Dr. Allison administered the final medication, and Katie passed peacefully into her heavenly sleep. We can not say enough about how pleased we were with Dr. Allison and how she helped us through this difficult time. She was very kind and compassionate, she did not rush anything and was very sensitive to our needs. We wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Lara Allison in helping us to help our precious baby girl go over the Rainbow Bridge.
