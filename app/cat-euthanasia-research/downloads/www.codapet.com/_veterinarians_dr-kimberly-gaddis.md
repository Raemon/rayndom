Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

Like most, I first considered becoming a veterinarian because I loved animals! That quickly blossomed into an interest in medicine and preventative care. Throughout my career, I have found that I find the most joy in advocating for the wellness of my patients and helping them have happy, comfortable lives. This includes helping them transition when they can no longer achieve that. This decision is a difficult one to make, and it has always been important to me that pet owners have someone that can walk through this process with. By providing this service, I hope to give owners comfort and reassurance with these decisions and also allow them to say goodbye in a familiar, peaceful environment.
