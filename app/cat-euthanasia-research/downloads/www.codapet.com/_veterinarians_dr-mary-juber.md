Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

One part of my job that I felt was not done as well as it could be was helping pets at the end of their lives. In clinics, it can feel rushed because we need to move on to the next appointment and the process was not always smooth or comfortable for the pet or for their family, although I tried hard to make it so. I was able to offer in-home euthanasia services to pets on occasion, which was a much better experience for all involved. The opportunity to focus on helping pets in their own homes during such a difficult time is something I am so thankful to have. I have completed several courses in helping families with their pets' end-of-life care and have completed coursework to receive CPEV (Certified Peaceful Euthanasia Provider) certification through CAETA (Companion Animal Euthanasia Training Academy). Through continuing education and shared experiences with other care providers, I am always trying to learn better techniques to help these special family members. My husband and I are empty-nesters, and we share our home with our long-haired cat, Peanut. When I am not tending to our furry housemate, I enjoy reading, needlework, serving in our local church, and hiking, sailing, and traveling with my husband.

> Dr. Mary was wonderful to work with throughout this process. She brought me so much comfort during the last moments of my dog's life. She kindly explained the entire process and patiently helped us help our dog during his last moments. It was a blessing for her to come and for us to be able to do it outside in his favorite spot.

> It was a miracle that we found CodaPet at a very difficult time. Our Vet who has helped us out with other difficult decissions was not available so we had to locate another Vet. We reached out to CodaPet. They sent Dr. Mary Juber to us. Dr. Mary was extremely sensative to the decission we had to make for our Bailey who was 22 and was suffering with kidney failure. She was like an Angel sent to us.She was so gentle with our Bailey. Dr. Mary was also well aware of our sadness and emotional needs.We feel so Blessed to have had Dr. Mary Juber help us get thru this difficult choice we had to make. God Bless, Larry & Kathy

> I had to put down my 18 year old Shih Tzu, and it was obviously a very emotional time. I cannot stress how reassuring and gentle Dr. Mary was in being at our home and making our dog's passing as calm and beautiful as it could be. We all got to hold him in a place he felt safe, and he was comfortable and loved to the end. She took a difficult time for us and made it so we could feel we spared him any pain and fear. I am beyond grateful for how she helped us.

> The last 5 months of our beloved mini pinscher, Flora Lou's life were very difficult for all of us, as we didn’t want to let her go. We were heartbroken when we finally had to make this difficult decision, but were very pleased that CodaPet could perform in-home euthanasia, so that Flora’s last hours would be more comfortable at home with us. CodaPet staff were very cordial and professional over the phone and Dr. Mary Juber arrived at our home on time. Dr Mary greeted us with empathy, made herself comfortable in our own home environment, explained everything to us, and was well prepared using her veterinarian expertise to perform a compassionate and peaceful in-home euthanasia for Flora. I am still grieving for Flora, but as I write this personal in-home euthanasia experience, I am pleased to say that Dr. Mary gave us great support, love and care while we said goodbye, and also personally taking care of and returning Flora’s ashes to us. Thank you so much, Dr. Mary.

> It felt like time for my ill, beautiful, feisty, extra cuddly cat (Matilda) to leave this world. I made the decision that "in-home pet euthanasia" would be the most comfortable for her and for me. I made an appointment with CodaPet. The day of the appointment Matilda seemed to improve and Dr. Mary graciously, and with great understanding had no problems with the cancellation. 2days later I made another appointment. Caring, compassionate Dr. Mary arrived. She was so very kind, gentle, and skilled. Matilda and I were more comfortable than I thought possible. Nothing was rushed, all was very peaceful.

> Dr Mary was truly kind and compassionate during our appointment. We ended up having to schedule the visit sooner than we initially expected as our senior kitty got rapidly worse. Nothing about that day was easy, but everything was taken care of for us so we just got to be there for our companion. Dr Mary walked us through every step of the process, making sure we and our senior kitty were comfortable the whole time. I am so grateful we were able to say goodbye at home, where our kitty felt safe, and get those precious extra minutes with him.

> Dr. Juber is such a kind soul. She was very comforting in a very difficult decision. Great bedside manner with our Rottie during her final moments. She sat with us as we shared stories, laughed and cried while our sweet girl went to sleep. We received a very personalized card about 2 weeks later that touched all of our hearts and reassured us that we made the right decision. We can’t thank her enough for making a very sad decision a more pleasant experience.
