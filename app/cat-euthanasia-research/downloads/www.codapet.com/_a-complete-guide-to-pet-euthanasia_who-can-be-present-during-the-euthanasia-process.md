You know your pet best and are best able to know what persons and pets will provide the most comfort for both you and your pet.

**Q: Who is allowed to be present during in-home pet euthanasia?**

A: In-home pet euthanasia is designed to provide a deeply personal and customizable experience. You have the flexibility to choose who you want to be present during this difficult time. You know your pet best and are best able to know what persons and pets will provide the most comfort for both you and your pet.

**Q: Can friends and family be present during the euthanasia?**

A: Absolutely. In-home euthanasia allows for the inclusion of friends and family, offering emotional support during the farewell process. When considering who should be present, consider your pet’s preferences and comfort level. Some pets may prefer the quiet intimate setting with only a few loved ones, while others may relish all the attention of all their humans. Having loved ones present can be a source of comfort for both you and your pet.

**Q: Can other household pets be present during the euthanasia?**

A: Yes, it is possible to include other pets in the household. In-home euthanasia enables your furry companions to be present, allowing them to understand and share in this moment. Consider your pet's personality and preferences when deciding if they would benefit from the presence of their animal companions. If your pet has particularly rambunctious furry friends who may be excited and distracted by your veterinary guest’ presence, it may be best to allow them privacy to process what has happened after your vet has stepped out.

Q: **Should I include children during the euthanasia?**

A: The decision to include children is entirely up to you as you know your children best. In-home euthanasia provides a more intimate setting, allowing families to navigate this difficult moment together. Consider the age and emotional readiness of the children involved when making this decision. There are abundant resources available to help children of all ages navigate this sometimes difficult decision.

**Q: How do I decide who should be present during the euthanasia?**

A: Consider your pet's personality and wishes when deciding who to include. Think about who your pet would love to have present, or if there are individuals or other pets that may cause them stress. The goal is to create an environment that honors your pet's memory and provides the support you need during this emotional time.
