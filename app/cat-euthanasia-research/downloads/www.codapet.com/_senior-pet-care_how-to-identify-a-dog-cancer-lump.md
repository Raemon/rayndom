# How to Identify a Dog Cancer Lump

[Dr. Karen Whala](/experts/dr-karen-whala)

May 15, 2025

Dog cancer affects dogs as it does humans. Learn about signs, symptoms, and common types of dog cancer, such as lymphoma and osteosarcoma. Early detection is key.

## Summary

  * Cancer in a dog refers to the abnormal growth of cells that can spread throughout the body. In contrast, lumps are often benign growths or cysts that may not necessarily be cancerous but can require evaluation to rule out malignancy.
  * Lumps in dogs can develop from various causes, including infections, cysts, fat deposits, or tumors, which may be benign or cancerous.
  * While it's difficult to tell the difference at home definitively, benign lumps are usually soft, movable, and painless. In contrast, cancerous lumps tend to be firmer, fixed in place, and may grow rapidly or cause discomfort.



Discovering a lump on your beloved dog can be a source of immediate concern. It is essential to recognize the possible indications of a cancerous lump, which vary in appearance. These lumps may feel firm or pliable and could show changes in size over time. The color of the lump can also differ, having no standard hue to indicate malignancy. Importantly, cancerous growths can emerge on any part of your dog’s body, underscoring the need for thorough, regular check-ups.

Distinguishing between a cancerous lump and a benign one is vital, yet not always straightforward. Benign lumps often remain consistent in size and texture, whereas malignant ones might grow or evolve unpredictably.

A palpable lump on your dog should never be overlooked or presumed benign without veterinary insight. Changes in a lump's size, shape, or texture, particularly if rapid, necessitate immediate professional evaluation.

## **Characteristics of Dog Cancer Lumps**

### **Shape and Size of Cancer Lumps**

The shape and size of a lump can offer important insights into whether it could be indicative of cancer. While benign tumors are often round and smooth, cancerous lumps may present in a variety of shapes, displaying irregular borders and surface changes. These features may suggest a more aggressive nature of the lump, necessitating prompt veterinary attention.

A characteristic to be concerned about is the rate at which a lump changes. Cancerous growths often increase in size or undergo changes in shape at a noticeably faster pace than benign ones. Also noteworthy is that cancerous lumps can be situated in deeper tissue layers, making them less apparent to the eye but possibly more easily felt when petting or grooming your dog.

It's essential for owners to be vigilant about monitoring their pets for any new growths or alterations in existing lumps. By tracking these changes and maintaining open communication with your veterinarian, you can better assess the urgency and nature of the lump. At CodaPet, we are committed to guiding you through this process with empathy and expertise, helping you discern what symptoms may be of concern and offering the resources needed to address them sensitively and knowledgeably.

### **Color and Texture of Cancer Lumps**

The appearance of lumps on your pet can be concerning. When assessing canine cancer lumps, the color and texture are notable markers. Typically, a lump with cancerous potential may show a variation in color of the skin, sometimes presenting as darker than the surrounding skin. It's important to check carefully. Sometimes a cancerous growth is under the skin and thus hidden by a pet's hair. The texture can vary significantly, from firm and fixed to the underlying tissues, which may suggest something more sinister, to soft and mobile, which may be less alarming but still warrants attention.

### **Location of Cancer Lumps**

Cancerous lumps can appear anywhere on a dog's body, but there are certain areas where they are more commonly found. These include the skin, lymph nodes, and mammary glands. It's important to check all areas of your dog's body regularly for lumps, including those that might not be immediately visible. The location of a lump can also influence the treatment options available, with some areas being more challenging to treat than others. At CodaPet, we can provide guidance and resources to help you understand what to look for and what to expect if your dog is diagnosed with cancer.

### **Rate of Growth of Cancer Lumps**

The rate of growth in cancer lumps is a vital piece of diagnostic information. Benign tumors tend to exhibit slow growth patterns and may remain static in size over extended periods. In contrast, malignant growths can demonstrate more aggressive expansion. That said, the speed at which cancerous lumps grow can differ dramatically, influenced by the cancer's type and the individual dog's health and circumstances.

Observing and tracking the progression of any lump on your dog is crucial. Noticing a remarkable increase in size over a short span could be indicative of malignancy. Should such growth be observed, an immediate veterinary consultation is advised. At CodaPet, we understand the seriousness of these symptoms and offer support as you navigate your pet’s health concerns. Our resources and compassionate guidance are designed to help you during these potentially difficult times.

## **Difference Between Harmless Lumps and Cancerous Lumps**

### **Understanding Harmless Lumps**

Not all lumps are a sign of serious illness; many are harmless growths that may cause little to no discomfort to your pet. Understanding what harmless lumps are can provide peace of mind and inform your approach to your pet's care. Harmless lumps, often referred to as benign tumors, include a variety of growths such as lipomas—fatty tumors that are typically soft, movable, and painless. These growths can appear anywhere on the body and are particularly common in older dogs.

Cysts are another example, frequently arising from blocked oil glands or hair follicles. Sebaceous cysts, specifically, are filled with oils, fluid, or skin debris and are generally noncancerous. However, since some lumps may change over time, it is crucial to monitor them. Skin tags are also common benign skin growths that may hang off the skin and are generally of no medical concern.

Differentiating harmless lumps from ones that could be cancerous involves noting characteristics like size, texture, growth rate, and whether the lump is fixed in place or movable. Cancerous lumps may be more irregular in shape, hard, and anchored to the underlying tissue.

While these descriptions may offer a foundation, it's vital to consult with a veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis.

### **Identifying Characteristics of Cancerous Lumps**

Cancerous lumps possess distinctive features that set them apart from non-cancerous growths. Often, these lumps may grow rapidly or irregularly, changing in size more noticeably than benign growths. The surface may become rough or uneven, and the coloring could look different from the surrounding skin or tissue.

On palpation, cancerous lumps tend to be firmer and may be anchored to underlying tissues, making them less likely to move under the skin than benign lumps, which are generally soft and mobile.

Another alarming sign is the presence of a discharge or bleeding from the lump, which is not a common attribute of harmless growths. Recognizing these characteristics is crucial; however, they are not definitive for a diagnosis of cancer.

Due to the nuanced nature of these symptoms, a veterinarian's evaluation is essential for an accurate assessment. At CodaPet, we emphasize the importance of obtaining expert advice and support, ensuring that any concerns about lumps are professionally addressed with the utmost care and consideration for your pet's well-being.

### **Common Misconceptions About Lumps**

There are numerous misunderstandings surrounding lumps on pets that can lead well-meaning owners astray. It's a prevailing myth that a lump is less concerning if it appears painless or doesn't seem to bother the animal. However, the presence or absence of pain doesn't necessarily correlate with the nature of a lump. In fact, some very serious conditions may manifest as lumps that initially cause little to no discomfort. Similarly, there's a fallacy that cancerous lumps are consistently hard and fixed in place. This is misleading, as some malignant growths may be soft or even movable. The texture and mobility of a lump are not definitive indicators of whether it's cancerous.

It's critical for pet owners to understand that these common misconceptions should not guide their decisions. Only a qualified veterinarian can accurately assess a lump's characteristics and its implications for your pet's health. At CodaPet, we emphasize the importance of professional evaluation and are poised to offer compassionate support and information as you navigate your pet's diagnosis and possible treatment paths.

## **Physical Examination of Your Dog At Home**

### **How to Properly Examine Your Dog**

Regular at-home examinations are an important part of your dog's healthcare routine. To properly examine your dog for lumps, start by running your hands over their entire body, applying gentle pressure to feel for any unusual bumps or swellings. Be sure to check all areas of your dog's body, including under the armpits, on the belly, and in the mouth. If you find a lump, it's important not to panic. Take note of where you found the lump and its size, and then schedule an appointment with a vet for a professional evaluation.

### **Areas to Pay Close Attention to**

While lumps can appear anywhere on a dog's body, there are certain areas that you should pay close attention to during your at-home examinations. These areas include the skin, especially in areas with less fur; the mammary glands in female dogs; and the lymph nodes, which are located in various parts of the body, including the armpits, groin, and neck. To check these areas, use your fingers to gently feel for any lumps or swellings. Remember, early detection is key when it comes to treating cancer and other health issues. At CodaPet, we're here to provide the guidance and resources you need to conduct thorough at-home check-ups.

### **What to Look for During the Examination**

When conducting a physical examination of your dog at home, it's vital to be observant of any new lumps or bumps or changes in existing ones. Pay particular attention to:

  * **The size of any lumps** – noting if they appear to be growing.
  * **The color and texture** – any alterations in these could be significant.
  * **Any associated discomfort or signs of pain** **–** this could manifest as your dog limping or exhibiting behavior changes.



Beyond the physical characteristics of lumps, you should be watchful for systemic symptoms such as:

  * **Unexpected weight loss**.
  * **Decreased appetite**.
  * **General lethargy or decreased energy levels**.



These signs might suggest that a lump could be more than just a benign growth. Always keep in mind that while these signs can indicate cancer, they might also be indicative of other health issues. That's why if you detect any such changes, it's imperative to seek veterinary expertise. Contacting a professional will help ensure an accurate diagnosis and the best course of action for your furry friend's health. At CodaPet, we're dedicated to supporting you through these concerns, helping you to safeguard the happiness and health of your pet.

### **What to Do If a Lump is Found**

If you discover a lump on your pet during a routine check-up at home, it's pivotal to approach the situation with a sense of composed vigilance. Immediately document the lump's details, noting its precise location, size, texture, and if it has recently changed in any manner. The initial action should be to arrange a veterinary consultation for a thorough evaluation.

At the vet's office, anticipate a comprehensive physical examination. Your vet may suggest diagnostic tests such as a fine-needle aspiration, biopsy, or imaging like an ultrasound to ascertain the characteristics of the lump. At CodaPet, we understand the worry that accompanies the discovery of a lump on a beloved pet. Rest assured, we’re here to offer compassion and guide you with the pertinent resources and unfaltering support during these times.

These tests are necessary not just for diagnosis but also for crafting a carefully tailored treatment plan. At CodaPet, we're here to walk you through these procedures with understanding and support, ensuring you and your pet face this challenge with clarity and confidence.

### **Understanding the Testing Process**

Understanding the testing process for cancer lumps is an essential step in preparing both you and your pet for what lies ahead. When you bring your pet into the vet for an examination of a lump, here's what you can generally expect:

  * **Physical Examination** : The vet will start with a thorough physical examination, where they will palpate the lump, observing its size, shape, texture, and whether it appears to be fixed or mobile.
  * **Biopsy or Aspiration** : Depending on the initial assessment, your vet may recommend a biopsy or a fine-needle aspiration. These procedures are important to obtain a definitive diagnosis.
  * **Fine-needle Aspiration** : This minimally invasive procedure is typically done without sedation. The vet will use a needle to extract cells from the lump for cytology.
  * **Biopsy** : This is a more invasive process and your dog may need to be sedated or anesthetized. It involves the removal of a small piece of tissue from the lump for histopathological examination in the lab.
  * **Laboratory Analysis** : The gathered samples are sent to a veterinary pathologist who will analyze the cells or tissue. This step is critical to determine the nature of the lump—whether it's benign or cancerous.
  * **Waiting for Results** : The timeframe from initial testing to obtaining the results can vary. It generally takes several days to a week or more, based on the complexity of the tests and the workload of the laboratory.
  * **Preparing Your Pet** : Prior to testing, ensure your pet is calm and comfortable. If a biopsy is planned and anesthesia is required, your vet will guide you on the pre-test fasting or any other necessary preparation.



At CodaPet, we understand the anxiety that comes with waiting for a diagnosis. Rest assured that our compassionate team is here to offer guidance and emotional support. We're committed to providing you with resources and the care needed during this uncertain time, so you can focus on what's most important: being there for your pet.

### **Interpreting the Test Results**

After conducting veterinary tests for potential cancer lumps on your beloved pet, the next step is to comprehend what the results convey. This can be an overwhelming moment, but your veterinarian will play a key role in breaking down the findings clearly. When the results are in, they could reveal that the lump is benign, meaning it is noncancerous and may not require further treatment. However, if it presents an issue due to its size or location, causing discomfort or impacting your pet's quality of life, your vet might suggest its removal.

In the case that the lump is determined to be cancerous, your vet will collaborate with you to explore the various treatment pathways available. Options could range from surgery to remove the lump to more intensive methods like radiation therapy or chemotherapy. The recommended course of action will heavily depend on a few critical factors: the type and stage of the cancer, your pet's age, and their overall health.

### **Next Steps After a Positive Result**

Upon receiving a positive result, which indicates that the lump on your pet is cancerous, it’s natural to feel a sense of fear or uncertainty. However, it's important to know that, depending on the type and stage, many forms of canine cancer can be managed or treated with today's veterinary advancements.

The available treatment avenues can vary greatly and may include surgical procedures to excise the tumor, radiation therapy targeting cancerous cells, or chemotherapy intended to halt the proliferation of these cells. Each option is selected based on the cancer's location, type, and progression, as well as your pet’s overall health and well-being.

### **When To Consider Euthanasia**

If your dog has received a terminal diagnosis and is experiencing poor quality of life, it may be time to consider the most troubling option of all: euthanasia. No one ever wants to be in this situation, but in-home euthanasia services like Coda Pet offer a compassionate, peaceful way to say goodbye to a beloved pet in the comfort of their familiar surroundings, reducing the stress and anxiety that can come with a veterinary clinic visit.

After a cancer diagnosis, these services provide a more personalized experience, allowing pet owners to be present and support their pets during their final moments. This option can help preserve the dignity and comfort of both the pet and the family during an emotionally challenging time.
