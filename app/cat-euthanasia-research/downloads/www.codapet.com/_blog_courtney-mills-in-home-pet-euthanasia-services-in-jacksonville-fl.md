For Dr. Courtney Mills, offering in-home pet euthanasia goes beyond just a medical procedure; it’s a heartfelt mission to help families and their cherished pets navigate one of life’s toughest moments. With years of veterinary experience and a genuine commitment to compassionate care, Dr. Mills provides Jacksonville-area families the comfort and dignity of saying goodbye in the warmth of their own homes.

## **A Calling Rooted in Compassion and Care**

Dr. Mills’ path to veterinary medicine was paved by her deep love for animals and a strong desire to make a positive impact. From a young age, she felt a calling to help animals in need and knew she wanted a career that blended her passion with purpose. After earning her Doctor of Veterinary Medicine, she immersed herself in clinical practice, gaining invaluable experience in both routine care and more complex cases. 

Her shift to in-home euthanasia was inspired by the realization that traditional clinical settings can often feel overwhelming or impersonal during such sensitive times. “Saying goodbye to a pet is a deeply personal experience,” Dr. Mills explains. “I aim to help families create a serene, loving atmosphere where their pets feel safe and surrounded by those who love them.”

## **Bringing Comfort and Peace to Jacksonville Families**

As part of the CodaPet network, Dr. Mills brings her compassionate approach right into Jacksonville homes. She recognizes that every pet and family is unique, and she customizes her care to address their emotional and medical needs. Whether a dog is snuggled up on its favorite bed or a cat is basking in a sunny spot, Dr. Mills ensures that every moment is treated with empathy and respect. Her visits start with an open conversation to address any concerns, review the pet’s condition, and guide families through the euthanasia process. Dr. Mills uses quality-of-life assessments to help owners make informed decisions, ensuring they feel clear and confident about choosing the right time.

## **The Power of Saying Goodbye at Home**

Choosing in-home euthanasia comes with a host of benefits that go beyond just medical care. Dr. Mills emphasizes that being in a familiar environment, like home, can significantly ease anxiety and stress for pets, helping them stay calm during their final moments. For families, this intimate setting provides a private space to express their love, reminisce, and find closure, away from the hustle and bustle of a clinical atmosphere. Dr. Mills is dedicated to supporting families in Jacksonville, not only through medical assistance but also by offering emotional support.

She provides a comforting presence and guidance throughout the grieving process. “My goal is to honor the bond between pets and their people by making the farewell as peaceful as possible,” she shares.
