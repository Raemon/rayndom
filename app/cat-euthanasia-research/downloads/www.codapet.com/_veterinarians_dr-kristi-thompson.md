Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I saw Veterinary Medicine as the perfect field for combining my love of medicine with agriculture. While in private practice, I realized I had great compassion and empathy for those facing end-of-life decisions with their beloved pets. Privileged to perform a handful of in-home euthanasias while in practice, I was excited to learn of CodaPet’s mission to provide a peaceful, dignified passing for pets in the comfort of their own homes. I see euthanasia as the final gift an owner can give their pet, and having experienced having to put her own animals down, I know that being able to do so in a calm, peaceful setting is of paramount importance. I am excited to be able to offer this service to those in the Clarksville and surrounding areas.

## What pet parents are saying

> After 12 wonderful years, our family was devastated to learn our furry loved one was leaving us due to kidney disease that was progressing rapidly. I'm a matter of 6 weeks, he went from a very vocal, 9lb, playful, active, loving 12 year old cat to an unrecognizable, 5lb, lethargic, weak, silent, disoriented, sad little guy that was clearly in a lot of pain. He had started having back-to-back seizures, it broke our hearts to have to witness the scared confusion he was going through and watch him wither away. It was a call I never thought I'd have to make and would never wish on anyone. Kristi Thompson was so amazing, kind, considerate and so gentle with our sweet baby, Stash. She had even sat down with my daughter to help clean Stash up and because we didn't have the money for the extra stuff like paw prints and clay print but my daughter had the supplies, Mrs Thompson assisted my daughter in making some of her own. The Compassion this young woman showed us was beyond our expectations and we are so grateful. Highly recommend

> I am so grateful Dr. Kristi Thompson was with Blue and I during his passing. She was so kind and understanding, it felt like a friend coming into my home. She was very professional and gave me the facts when I needed them. Two hours before our meeting, I got really nervous and was second guessing the decision. Dr. Thompson was available by phone/text the whole day and our conversation really helped me to see things clearly, without trying to sway me one way or the other. She sat and talked to me with Blue for a good 45 minutes, getting Blue comfortable with her, as I had expressed concern that he was very skittish. She listened and addressed all of my concerns, and I felt she was so gentle and caring with Blue and I. Thank you so much Dr. Thompson, for doing the work you do and making such a harrowing decision as peaceful as possible. - Sam

> Dr. Thompson was compassionate, professional, and lead us through the process to say goodbye to our Maggie. She provided a peaceful environment for Maggie and our family. We are grateful for Dr. Thompson's gentle and thoughtful care and her follow-up communication. We were unaware this service existed until our friend told us they had used CodaPet and how sweet the experience was for them. We totally agree.

> It's never easy making the hard decision to let a beloved pet cross the rainbow bridge. But Dr. Thompson made the decision and process much easier as we let our sweet old man, Felix (19 y/r tabby), go peacefully. He loved bird/wildlife watching while sitting out on our back porch. This is where Dr. Thompson met Felix and cooed at how precious he was. She gave him so much love while she slowly got him sleepy and comfortable. He was able to enjoy his favorite view surrounded by his humans. I will forever be grateful for her patience, gentleness, and reassurance that it was time for him to be with the Lord. I was pleasantly surprised when she sent us a very touching card in the mail the next day or so thanking us for letting her be apart of his peaceful passing. Their services are particularly appreciated when pets don't enjoy car rides or have vet office anxiety. Thank you so much Dr. Thompson - we very thankful for angels like you in this world!

> I cannot describe how grateful I am to Dr. Thompson. Choosing to say goodbye to my most cherished friend was a choice I had hoped I'd never have to make, but she walked us through the process and kept our spirits up. When it came time, her words allowed me to proceed with no doubts. Mittens, my cat of 18 years was calm through it all, and was treated with such dignity and warmth. A peaceful release was the final gift I hoped to give to her, and Dr. Thompson made that possible.

> While my heart is still aching from the loss of my dear Bella, I find solace in knowing that her final journey was filled with such tenderness and love, thanks to Dr. Thompson. Her compassion turned a very difficult moment into a truly beautiful and loving final act to comfort and relieve my baby. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for your professionalism, being informative every step of the way and most of all for genuinely sharing in my pain as a pet parent whom also has gone through this process. God made no mistake in leading me to Dr. Thompson if in the the future I should need this service she is my go to!!! Top tier service 🥹

> Dr. Thompson was so kind and caring. As difficult as it was to let our Golden fella cross the Rainbow Bridge, she reminded us that we were doing the best thing for him. Dr. Thompson made our in-house euthanasia experience as pleasant as it could possibly be. So thankful we got to say our 'see ya later's' to our dog in our home, in his favorite spot. Thank you, Dr. Thompson-

> I can’t say enough good things about Dr Kristi Thompson’s kindness and compassion both before, during, and after this process. 10/10 would recommend. She thoroughly and professionally explained the process. She listened carefully to the long list of ailments our senior dog was experiencing. She then examined our dog and explained what was potentially treatable, and what the prognosis was. This allowed us the chance to make a fully informed decision before proceeding. I appreciated that, especially since it was a lethal one for a very loved family member. We never felt rushed or pressured one way or the other. I just wish there were people doctors who were as attentive, kind, compassionate, and laid out the various options to their patients.

> Dr Kristi Thompson is a very caring and skilled veterinarian. She petted and soothed our sweet Dixie, and explained everything she was going to do. She gave us time and space to be with Dixie, and love on her so she could pass in peace. It’s so hard to say goodbye to our sweet girl, but Dr Thompson really made it as gentle and easy as it could be for Dixie. I highly recommend her for IN-HOME Pet Euthanasia. I would definitely use her again, to give my pet a peaceful, comfortable in-home passing. Diane Kolaski -Clarksville, TN

> Dr. Kristi Thompson was wonderful during this awful time for my family. She was easy to talk to and very informative during the entire process. I felt that she genuinely cared for my pup and I know she took fantastic care of her even when she left our home to head to Faithful Companions. While this service is a bit pricey, I am so glad my girl got to leave this world comfy and sleepy in her dog bed at home.

> Dr. Thompson helped us say goodbye to our sweet boy. A difficult moment made easier because he could be in his home, with his humans, and because she took the time to allow him to get to know and be comfortable around her. We sincerely appreciate her professionalism and kindness, and ensuring our beloved Sammy felt comfortable, safe, and loved.
