Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I have wanted to be a veterinarian since I was a little kid. I loved helping animals, and as I grew older, I also learned that I loved helping owners better understand and care for their own fur babies. I enjoy all aspects of veterinary medicine, and while working in brick-and-mortar practices was fulfilling, I also could tell that there was something missing. I started an in-home euthanasia business in 2019 because I could see the need for an option for more personalized, compassionate, and comfortable experience for animals at the end of their lives. Euthanasia is the kindest final gift we can give the animals that have given us so much, and it is genuinely an honor to help these furry family members feel as safe and pain free as possible while they pass into a peaceful death. On a more personal note, I want to emphasize that I know exactly how hard the choice to euthanize is. I have had to make that decision more often than I would like for my own beloved pets, and each time it is heartbreaking. The last thing anyone needs when traveling this difficult path is pressure or judgement from a veterinarian. I want to be a partner in helping you decide what is right for your family, and know that I will do everything I can to take the sting out of death for both you and your fur baby.

> Dr. Crozier was so amazing, compassionate, and caring to us when we had to say goodbye to our dog. It’s never an easy thing but the whole experience made it feel peaceful and respectful and she really expressed genuine care. She was incredibly communicative and open with us and overall for a crappy situation, she made it a good experience. I was really nervous about making it as painless and fear-free for my dog as possible and she really aided in creating that space. I would highly recommend her to anyone!

> Dr. Croizer was so kind and gentle during the whole process. While one no wants to go through this sad process, it was much easier having Dr. Croizer there, making Jake comfortable, talking with me about Jake and his life while he passed.

> Dr. Sarah Crozier helped us in a very difficult time. Six days prior we lost our other bulldog suddenly to heart failure. Dr. Crozier was kind, understanding, patient and informative. She soothed my nerves for our poor Alfred explaining that we were providing him a pain free journey as our final gift to him. We cannot believe how incredible she was. Thank you so much Dr. Crozier.

> Dr. Crozier was amazing. She helped us get thru a really hard day. She took the time to not only get to know Georgia but our family as well. She was so kind and patient . She talked us thru every step. Most importantly, Georgia was never scared. That all I wanted was for her to not be pain or know what was going on. Georgia just drifted off to sleep peacefully. I highly recommend Dr Crozier if you have to make the hard decision to euthanize

> Dr. Sarah Crozier was absolutely incredible. My pup had terminal mammary cancer and had stopped being able to sit or lay down for comfort, and I made the terribly difficult decision to put her down. Dr. Crozier called me before my appointment date to get an understanding of my dog, and gave me time to ask any questions or air any concerns. When she arrived for our appointment time, she had a calm kind presence, and my pup immediately trusted her. She was so very kind through the whole process, moving at a pace I was comfortable with, and being so kind and friendly to my pup. She even had my sweet girl excited and happy for the treats her sedatives were hidden in. She asked questions about who my dog was and some of our very best memories, and she allowed me the honor of my dog passing peacefully in my lap, knowing she was loved and never knowing anything was wrong. She allowed me to assist in cleaning her up before leaving with her, and let me take all the time I needed saying goodbye. Losing my dog was more difficult than I could explain, but having Dr. Crozier to make the experience so gentle on my pup and I meant the world to me. She afforded us a beautiful last few minutes together, and made a horrible event so much better with her kindness, knowledge, and heart. Hugely and forever thankful for Dr. Crozier and her work.
