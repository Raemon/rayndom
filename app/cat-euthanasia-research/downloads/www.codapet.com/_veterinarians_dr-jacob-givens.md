Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

Throughout my career, I have witnessed firsthand the difference between clinic-based and in-home euthanasia experiences. Time and again, I've seen the profound relief and comfort that in-home euthanasia brings to both pets and their families during one of life's most difficult moments. This understanding inspired me to offer this service to my community, allowing beloved companions to pass peacefully in the comfort of their own homes, surrounded by the people and places they know and love. My wife Sarah and I are blessed with three boys, and together we share our home with two German Shorthaired Pointers, Ellie and Judge, along with a small flock of chickens. My experiences as both a father and pet parent have given me an even deeper appreciation for the irreplaceable role our animals play in our families. When I'm not working, you'll often find me on a family adventure, camping and hiking, tending to my garden, or participating in domestic and international mission trips. My approach to end-of-life care centers on providing a comfortable, peaceful experience for families and their beloved pets. Every cherished companion deserves to transition with dignity, surrounded by love, in the place they've always called home.

## What pet parents are saying

> Dr. Givens was wonderful. It's such a painful experience to go through but he was both professional and caring. He made my Skylar's last moments as comfortable as possible. I can never thank him enough for that gift.

> We reached out to Dr Givens when our two labs grew too weary for this world, but loved us too much to let go. They were over 14 and the idea of taking them anywhere seemed too overwhelming to arrange, as well as too stressful to these sweet dogs. After reaching out to schedule, Dr Givens reached out and talked us through the process, gave us all oir options, and made sure we were comfortable (as we could be) with the plan. When the day came, there was steady communication on timing and no surprises. It was the hardest decision, but being able to hold our dogs and say goodbye in the environment they knew was beyond incredible and a gift to them, as well as us. We didn't feel rushed at any point, and the care and love they treated our dogs with throughout the whole process was just so special to us. I hope no one ever has to make the decision to put their pet down, but we could not have asked for anything more in this process and would 100% reach out to Dr Givens if we have to make a decision like this again. I appreciate the peace and love felt throughout; it brought a bit of light into an otherwise very hard process and time in our lives. Thanks so much, Dr Givens.
