Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I became a vet partly because I grew up on a ranch with a variety of animals and loved being able to help take care of them. I have wanted to be in this profession since I was five years old. I love spending time with my partner, pets, friends, and visiting all of the beautiful places in this world...especially in Colorado! Also love trail running and scuba diving.

> Dr. Simpson was really great to work with. She understood the urgency of our need and came early in the morning even though she didn’t have any appointments available. She was very compassionate and calm and made this stressful situation much better.

> Dr. Katie came to us close to the Christmas holiday with an impossible task: putting our 13-year-old dog to rest just 3 days before what’s supposed to be the happiest day of our kids year. She walked them through the entire procedure and even included them in the process so they could properly understand what was happening to their puppy dog as well as help him go to the next phase. I can’t say enough on how compassionate Dr. Katie was and, while we certainly never want to have to do these things, people like Dr. Katie make it something to be honored and respected. We appreciate her so much and believe she has played an important role in our children’s lives by helping them with the loss of their first pet. We cannot recommend her enough.

We cannot recommend her enough--she even sent us a sympathy card---Dr. Katie Simpson is an amazing woman doing incredible work. We are so grateful. Liz, Jim, Cubby and Kat (Wilson's family)

> Katie has euthanized two of our dogs in the space of 18 months, both on short notice due to increasingly aggressive cancers. She was so extraordinary last time that I we requested her by name this time. Words don’t do justice to her skill and empathetic demeanor. She feels like an honorary family member at this point, and we are incredibly grateful for her role in our toughest times.

> Dr Katie was a blessing for us during this process. I could not have asked for a more compassionate, knowledgeable, and kind person. This was one of the hardest thing my husband and I have had to do, but having Dr Katie with us through the process of putting down our beloved cat made the world of difference.

> There is nothing easy about letting our furry family members pass over the rainbow bridge, but our experience with Dr. Katie Simpson was the best we could imagine. She communicated with us in the days and hours before she arrived to administer at home euthanasia, so we knew what to expect. She was extraordinarily kind and patient as we went through our last minute doubts and did not rush us to a decision. Her bedside manner was gentle and we are very grateful for her skills and helping us give our beloved dog a serene passing.

> Dr. Simpson went out of her way to provide us exceptional service including bringing our pet's clay paw print down to us so we did not have to make a special trip to Ft Collins to pick it up. During her visit with us she was so sympathetic to our situation and gentle and kind with all of our pets.

> We’ve experienced in-home pet euthanasia several times and the opportunity to let Munchkin leave us while resting in front of her fireplace rather than being crated for a drive to town was very valuable to all of us. Dr. Katie was very calm, comforting and compassionate and she made the process of letting Munchkin go one of love and respect. She was very attuned to Munchkin’s comfort and emotional needs, but also made sure that we thought about and understood how the other pets in the house might react to Munchkin’s passing.

> No one what’s to call Dr Katie but if you have to put your pet down, Dr Katie is the one to call. We had to say goodbye to our loving Bouvier Norman. Dr Katie handled this sad task with love and compassion for Norman as well as us. She was patient and kind and Norman passed peacefully with his head on my lap.

> Dr. Simpson was so wonderful when I needed to put my dog down. She didn't rush me, she reassured me about the decision and gave me time alone once he passed. She was so gentle and caring with him, but also with me. I could not have had a better experience than being at home where he is comfortable, and with Dr. Katie there to support.
