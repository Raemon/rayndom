# Ten Part-time Jobs for Veterinarians

## 1\. **Locum Tenens Veterinarian**

A locum tenens veterinarian is a temporary or part-time veterinarian who fills in for other veterinarians when they are on leave or when the clinic needs additional help. These positions can be short-term or long-term, and they offer flexibility in scheduling. Locum tenens veterinarians may work in various settings, such as private practices, animal hospitals, or shelters. Their responsibilities include providing medical care to animals, performing surgeries, prescribing medications, and communicating with pet owners.

## 2\. **Relief Veterinarian**

Relief veterinarians are similar to locum tenens veterinarians in that they provide temporary veterinary services to clinics and hospitals. However, relief veterinarians often have more predictable schedules and may work regularly on specific days of the week or month. This type of part-time position allows veterinarians to maintain a work-life balance while still practicing veterinary medicine.

## 3\. **Telemedicine Veterinarian**

With the advancement of technology, telemedicine has become increasingly popular in jurisdictions which allow it. Part-time telemedicine veterinarians provide remote consultations to pet owners, offering medical advice, diagnosing conditions, and prescribing treatments via online platforms or phone calls. This role allows veterinarians to work from home or any location with internet access, making it an attractive option for those seeking part-time opportunities with flexible hours.

## 4\. **Research Veterinarian**

Part-time research veterinarians contribute to scientific advancements by working in research facilities, universities, or pharmaceutical companies. They may be involved in conducting clinical trials, studying animal diseases, or developing new treatments. This role offers a unique opportunity to engage in veterinary medicine from a research perspective while maintaining a part-time schedule.

## 5\. **Shelter Veterinarian**

Part-time shelter veterinarians work at animal shelters or rescue organizations, providing medical care to homeless animals. Their duties may include spaying/neutering, vaccinations, treating injuries and illnesses, and ensuring the overall well-being of the animals in the shelter’s care. Part-time shelter veterinarians play a crucial role in improving the health and adoption prospects of animals in need.

## 6\. **Wildlife Veterinarian**

Part-time wildlife veterinarians work with wildlife rehabilitation centers or organizations to provide medical care to injured or orphaned wild animals and educate the public. They may diagnose and treat wildlife injuries, perform surgeries when necessary, and oversee the rehabilitation process before releasing the animals back into their natural habitats or they may focus on education of the public or aspiring wildlife rehabbers.

## 7\. **Veterinary Consultant**

Part-time veterinary consultants offer their expertise to various organizations such as pet insurance companies, pet product manufacturers, or legal firms requiring veterinary input. They may review medical records, provide expert opinions on cases involving animals, or contribute to product development based on their veterinary knowledge and experience.

## 8\. **Emergency Veterinarian**

Emergency veterinarians work in emergency and critical care settings, providing urgent medical attention to animals when regular veterinary care is unavailable, whether after hours, holidays, or simply due to a booked schedule. These professionals handle a wide range of cases, from trauma and toxicities to severe illnesses. Working as an emergency vet requires quick thinking, strong decision-making skills, and the ability to remain calm under pressure. This gig option offers a challenging yet rewarding experience for veterinarians who thrive in high-stress environments.

## 9**. Mobile Veterinarian:**

Mobile veterinarians operate out of a customized vehicle or travel to clients’ homes to provide veterinary care. This gig option is ideal for veterinarians who prefer a more personalized approach to animal healthcare and enjoy the convenience of a flexible work schedule. Mobile vets offer services such as wellness exams, vaccinations, minor surgeries, and euthanasia in the comfort of the pet’s home environment. This option allows veterinarians to build strong relationships with clients and their pets while reducing the stress associated with transport and traditional clinic visits.

## 10.**In Home Euthanasia Veterinarian**

An in-home euthanasia vet is a one who specializes in providing end-of-life care to animals in the comfort of their home. These veterinarians help clients make difficult decisions regarding their pets' quality of life and when it is time to say goodbye. In-home euthanasia vets must be compassionate, empathetic, and skilled in communicating with families during a challenging time. This option allows veterinarians a more flexible work schedule and the ability to work independently while connecting with pet parents and providing compassion and empathy.
