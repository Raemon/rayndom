## What pet parents are saying

> I can't say enough fabulous things about Dr. Jessica Pruitt! It was a hard decision (as it always will be) when its time for our "buddies" to have to leave us:( but Dr. Jessica is so gentle and kind. She explains everything, is very patient and my Molly just warmed right up to her which made things even easier. I can't express the gratitude to Dr. Jessica enough as she made this as peaceful as can be for all of us:) Thank you Dr. Jessica!

> We recently had to make the incredibly difficult decision to say goodbye to our beloved dog, Axle. Dr. Pruitt was there with us every step of the way, and I can’t express how grateful we are for her compassion, care, and kindness during such a heartbreaking moment. From the moment she arrived , Dr. Pruitt treated Axle with the utmost respect and gentleness. She took the time to talk us through the process, made sure we were comfortable, and most importantly, made sure Axle was at peace. It was clear she genuinely cares about both her patients and their families. Helping a pet cross the rainbow bridge is never easy, but Dr. Pruitt made it as comforting and dignified as it could possibly be. We will always remember her warmth and empathy during one of the hardest days of our lives. Thank you, Dr. Pruitt, for helping our boy leave this world surrounded by love.

> I was so thankful Dr. Pruitt was available when we needed her. I made an emergency appointment, and within an hour she was at my home. Unreal response time, and thankful Conor didn't have to suffer another 24 hours. Thanks again, Dr. Pruitt.
