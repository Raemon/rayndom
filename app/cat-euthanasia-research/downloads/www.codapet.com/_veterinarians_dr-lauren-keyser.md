About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I have always known I wanted to be a veterinarian. Euthanasia is an important aspect of our career and in high demand. Euthanasias are difficult to plan, and I have gotten many requests for at home euthanasias in just my two years of practice. I want to be able to provide love and care even in a pet’s last moments.

> Dr Keyser is one of the kindest and compassionate vets I have met. She made the saddest day easier than I could ever imagine. I have had many fur babies and have used several vets in Columbus over the years. This was the first time with euthanasia. Thank you so much Dr Keyser for taking care of Oscar and myself. I sure do miss him so much! All of my family is so appreciative that you took such good care of us.

> I cannot speak highly enough of Dr. Keyser and the incredible care she provided during a difficult time for my soul dog. Dr. Keyser’s gentleness, kindness, and compassion were truly remarkable. She went above and beyond to accommodate all of my special requests and ensured that my fur baby’s last moments were filled with peace and comfort. Having Dr. Keyser by my side was invaluable, and I cannot imagine my boy’s last day being any different. Her presence brought me immense peace during a heartbreaking moment, and she was a huge part of the peace I feel in the days that have followed. The ceremony she conducted was the most calming, beautiful, and peaceful experience I could have hoped for. If you’re considering in-home pet euthanasia, I can assure you that it is worth every single penny, especially with Dr. Keyser. Thank you, Dr. Keyser, for your exceptional service and unwavering support.
