> Dr. Gordon came through for us in every way--compassionate, a good listener and able to explain the process clearly . Her communication was always open, timely and never was there a question unanswered about Pepper's in home euthanasia and the cremation process at a local Oklahoma facility. The most needed and appreciated part was the follow up by Dr Gordon, taking care in making sure our first days following were going ok. I suggest for potential clients to look at the CODA website and see what they have to offer. ( options, pricing, aftercare and veternarian bio) I am very happy with CODA and Dr Gordon.

> In my life I have been blessed to have a few dogs. Saying goodbye is part of the price we pay. Dr. Gordon made this horrible time easier. I will be eternally grateful for the kindness and compassion she showed not only our precious Baby Girl but also us.

> Dr. Gordon was very kind and understanding during this terrible time. She showed us compassion and made our precious fur babies last moments at peace with us by her. Bentley wasn't scared and she worked around us and talked to us to help keep us at is. This is not something anyone wants to go through. But being able to spend those last moments at home with her instead of being in a vets office will always be something I appreciate that this service offers and would recommend to any pet owner. Dr. Gordon was very responsive and when things got worse quickly she adjusted her appointment to visit us earlier so that Bentley didn't have to suffer more than she was. I am grateful for the care she took of our sweet baby.

> Cara seemed very caring and had a calm presence. The issue was the first medicine out of three that were administered. It was an oral med and must have tasted awful to Lily. She freaked out and had a terrified look on her face, and was trying desperately to get the taste out of her mouth. It took several minutes for her to calm down so Cara could go on with the other two steps. What should have been a calm death in our home for Lily instead was horrifying for her and for my wife and me. We have had two dogs and three cats euthanized at the vet, and this has never been an issue before. I would not recommend Coda until they change protocol.

> Dr. Gordon is amazing. She explained to us dogs didn’t get hospice or morphine drips. Our Baby Girl was in pain. She was not going to get any better. She didn’t even lift her head when Dr. Gordon came in. She was so very kind and respectful for both our little girl and ourselves. I will never be able to thank her enough!

> Dr Cara Gordon was kind and professional. She made my pet and my family feel at ease throughout the entire process. She explained everything as in depth as I wanted, was prompt, and listened to my concerns beforehand and my stories of my beloved pet after. For such a sad day, it was peaceful and loving. I would recommend her to anyone for this service and if I were to ever need this service again I would ask her.

> Our experience with Dr. Gordon was exactly what we hoped it would be. We felt so lucky to have her calm, kind, caring bedside demeanor as part of this otherwise difficult experience. Dr. Gordon let our pet take things as his own pace, never rushed the appointment, and was very loving in our pet’s final moments. I would choose this service and this provider again.

> Dr. Gordon is the absolute best. She is so kind and compassionate. Our dogs instantly loved her when she entered our home, and we know they are the best judge of character. A few weeks ago we had to put down our 16yo miniature dachshund, and then two weeks later we unexpectedly had to put down our 10yo lab. She explained everything, and made our dogs so comfortable through the process. I will never ever use a vet clinic again. She follows up with you after everything is completed, and she will respond anytime day or night if you need anything. She has this calming presence about her, and we can’t recommend her enough.

> Meeting someone for the first time under such sad circumstances has the potential to be quite uncomfortable for all involved. Dr Gordon was caring, kind and empathic. This allowed me to grieve my loss in an accepting, unhurried environment. She took particular care to insure our sweet Hobie was comfortable and was able to cross the rainbow bridge in the love and embrace of his human, he so kindly adopted years before. Thank you, Dr Gordon.

> I simply cannot imagine a more peaceful, supportive way to say goodbye to your pet. Our beloved hound was unable to stand on her last day and rather than pick her up and carry her to her vet (which would have been painful and confusing), we called Dr. Gordon who worked us in as soon as possible. She treated us and Sahara with dignity and respect and allowed us to say goodbye in the comfort of our home. Thank you for this invaluable service.

> I have nothing but the highest respect for the care, patience, and dignity that doctor Cara Gordon displayed during her visit with our beloved dog, Jake. This was absolutely one of the hardest decision we have ever had to make, and it truly broke our hearts to do so. Dr. Cara was so extremely patient and kind to us, but most especially to Jake. You could tell in her actions that she truly loves animals and wanted the absolute best for us and for Jake. I hope to never have to go through this again, but if we do, Dr. Cara would be the only one I would want to go through this experience with. Thank you so much for the kindness and graciousness you showed Jake, my husband, and me. Lori Castle

> Dr. Cara Gordon with Coda Pet embodies the epitome of compassionate care and patience. From the moment she stepped into our house, she greeted my family with empathy, setting the tone for a truly remarkable experience. Dr. Gordon’s genuine love for animals shines through in every interaction, as she took the time to listen attentively to our concerns and addressed them with utmost care. Her patience knows no bounds, whether it's answering endless questions or soothing nervous pets or handling my young kids decide whether or not they wanted to be in the room. She was patient and so kind to our family. She had a remarkable ability to ease our minds and reassured us that Mavrick was no longer going to be in pain and we were doing the right thing. In times of uncertainty and difficult decisions, Dr. Gordon provided unwavering support and guidance, offering empathy and understanding every step of the way. I would absolutely recommend this service to anyone. This experience has been so helpful in our grieving process. Mavrick was our black lab/chow mix and he 15 years old and traveled the world with us while we served in the Military. We are so thankful for Dr Cara Gordon.

> I’m so thankful that we choose to go this route at home rather than a cold table in a vet office. Dr.Gordon was wonderful with us. She treated our sweet Nyx with such kindness before & afterwards. I cannot imagine saying goodbye to our girl any other way. I hope I don’t need too but if I ever do I’ll definitely be calling her again!

> We had a 13 year old who was deteriorating rapidly and we wanted to help him before him started suffering. We contacted codapet who sent Dr. Cara Gordon who came to our house for in home pet euthanasia. I can’t imagine the experience is ever great, but Dr. Gordon was incredibly kind, gentle and sincere. She talked us through the procedure (as much as we wanted to) and was incredibly compassionate. I’m sorry for anyone that needs this service, but I can say that Dr. Gordon was an excellent person for this.

> Dr. Gordon showed great empathy for what my puppy, AJ Brown, and I were experiencing. She was so delicate with my little boy. He did not even know she had entered the room. He had no stress or anxiety in his final moments. He gently and peacefully crossed Rainbow Bridge to be joined with his Creature and family. Thank you, Dr. Gordon
