Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

From a young age, I have felt a deep connection to animals and a strong desire to support them through every stage of their lives. My decision to provide in-home humane euthanasia services stems from this passion, as well as my commitment to ensuring pets experience a peaceful passing in the comfort of their own home, surrounded by their loved ones. This approach honors the bond we share with our pets and offers families a compassionate and serene way to say goodbye.

> Dr. Hundley is an angel. She came to our home for an urgent situation after our elderly greyhound suffered a broken leg. She was compassionate and caring and provided him (and us) with comfort in his last moments.

> This service was a game changer when I needed it most. Dr. Hundley was incredibly kind, informative, and compassionate during my at-home euthanasia experience. Getting to say goodbye to my best friend in our shared space was the biggest blessing. You will not regret calling CodaPet. Thank you Dr. Hundley for making my last moments with Oreo the most comfortable possible, I am endlessly grateful.

> This was my first experience losing a pet and this was the best decision that we made. danielle was so sweet and took the time to explain the process both before our appointment and during. The opportunity to do this at home was just what we needed to keep our girl mocha safe and warm in her own home instead of having anxiety from traveling and being in the vets office which can be scary for animals. I will be forever thankful to danielle and codapet for helping us during this time.

> Dr. Hundley was very compassionate and supportive. We were glad that Sully was able to be at home in a comfortable and familiar space surrounded by those who loved him. We were very emotional but we knew it was the right thing to do. Dr.Hundley talked to us and Sully as he was crossing the rainbow bridge. She explained everything ahead of time and gave us time to make our own decision. She thought to ask if he had a favorite toy that he could take with him (which happened to be a tissue box - he is a boxer) and we sent him with his new blanket. She discussed private and group cremation, getting a paw print, clay print, or a Styrofoam print, and she thought to clip some of his soft fur from different spots with his different colors. I would highly recommend this service and Dr. Hundley for anyone who has to face this difficult decision.

> Having Dr Hundley come to my home was such a relief for me and Sophie. I was unable to get Sophie into a cat carrier and coming to the house worked well. Dr Hundley was so compassionate and caring of my feelings and Sophie’s feelings. She was so patient and supportive for all of us and let my daughter and I have our time with Sophie. Thank you very much for your care. Teri Block

> I had to make the hard decision to put my beloved cat, Boots, to rest a few weeks ago. He was not a fan of vets so I could not bear the thought of bringing him into a clinic to do so. I found Dr. Hundley while searching for in-home euthanasia. She made a sad and stressful situation very peaceful. She was so caring and professional. She also offered to do paw prints and give me some of his fur that she shaved; I will cherish them forever. I highly recommend Dr. Hundley.

> Dr. Huntley was able to come to our house within 24 hour period, as our friend and pet Elmer, could not get into a car and the last 2 days, get up from the floor, so, it was time to help him, though I was not ready. Nobody ever is. Dr. Huntley is SO compationate with our family, who was there to say goodbye. My wife and I held him so he knew that we were going to miss him. I would have rather met Dr. Huntley in another way, but we are glad, there is a service that can take care of everything. She was very respectful and compassionate when it came to the "time" and the after care. Elmer is running with his friends that left us before, and I can't wait to see them all again.

> I can't begin to express how wonderful Dr. Hundley was in helping us say goodbye to our beloved dog. She helped bring an incredibly painful day to a peaceful end and I could tell how much she truly cared. My beautiful Jenny was able to cross over in her own home, surrounded by her family and I know she didn't feel any fear, only our love for her. Thank you so much for making this possible.

> Charley, our beloved collie, was quickly declining in health. We decided on euthanasia at home because we felt a familiar environment would be less stressful for him. Dr Hundley of CodaPet did an excellent job. She was very kind, compassionate, and respectful. She was very calming and gentle with Charley. His passing was very peaceful. She also arranged and transported his body for cremation. We highly recommend her if you are considering pet euthanasia at home.

> Our family can’t thank her enough for her thoughtful and compassionate care that she expressed to our sweet Layla and our family. It’s a very hard decision to make to have your pet euthanized. Dr. Hundley was so wonderful and made our sweet girls passing painless and peaceful. We will miss our sweet Layla, but we know we will see her again… thank you so much, Dr. Hundley❤️

> Dr. Danielle was just what our boy needed in his final hours. Her attention to comfort and care for our boy Gabe, made his crossing over at home a gentle experience rather than one of stress, anxiety and unfamiliarity. The entire family( 3 generations) we able to surround and swaddle our boy in his final time with us.❤️

> We had the unfortunate event of a cat with a deteriorating health condition. We made the extremely difficult decision to have an at home euthanasia, where she would be warm, comfortable, and surrounded by the ones she loved. Danielle was so sweet, loving, and understanding for the whole process. Danielle allowed us to say goodbye and made sure she was super comfortable. Our little baby passed away with no complications. It hurts, but we know we made the right decision and are grateful Danielle gave us this.

> Danielle was amazing! She helped us through a difficult situation when my regular vet didn't want to come to our home to put down our beloved dog Shadow who was losing the battle with Mast Cell tumors. She made it so Shadow was completely comfortable and with the people he loved when he crossed the rainbow bridge!! She even prayed over him as she was slowly injected the final medicine. I will definitely use Danielle again if we need this service in the future!

> Dr Hundley was wonderful. She came to my mom’s home to help with her cat. My mom’s cat was very feisty and difficult to deal with but Dr Hundley was prepared for any situation and was incredibly patient, letting things take their time, she was in no rush to get things done. She was professional, soothing, and symapthetic. Dr Hundley made this difficult process much easier for our family.

> I chose in-home pet euthanasia for my beloved dog Cafe. He was the best dog and I wanted his final journey to be at home where he knew and felt loved, safe, and comfortable. Dr Danielle Hundley cared for him when he became ill and she is the most kind, caring and compassionate veterinarian I've ever had the pleasure of having care for my dog. I was so fortunate and relieved to know she would come to my home when I realized it was Cafe's time to go. It was a devastating time for me, but she made it the best experience possible and cared for Cafe as if he was her own pet. I can't express how much this meant to me and how grateful I am, knowing Cafe had the very best care at the end of his life. Thank you so much.
