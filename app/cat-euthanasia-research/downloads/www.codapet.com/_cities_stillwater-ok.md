We charge cancellation fee of $100 if an appointment is cancelled less than 4 hours before the start time. If your pet passes away before your appointment you would not be charged a cancellation fee.

## Other Consideration

### Large Animals

If you have a larger pet, your vet may need the help of one friend or family member. Talk to your vet about options and limitations when they reach out to you prior to your appointment, and they will inform you of any extra cost for your situation. 

### How do I get my pet’s ashes

Options for your pets return home and memorabilia depend on your local provider. Your vet coordinate the return of your pet’s ashes and let you know if there are additional fees for urn delivery. 

### Special factors affecting price

Extra time or medications needed can affect the total price. Other factors can be if it is decided that it’s not time to euthanize your pet after the vet has arrive. In that case, only the travel fee, platform fee, and a quality of life consult would apply. 

## FAQs

### What’s included in the total cost?

The total cost includes the in-home pet euthanasia service fee, any travel fee (if any apply), and a platform fee. Additionally, depending on your choice, fees may apply for cremation services or keepsakes.

### Will the vet take my pet with them after the appointment?

During your appointment, your vet will confirm your aftercare selection with you. If you choose to arrange cremation services, your vet will oversee your pet’s transportation to a local facility for cremation. If your preferred cremation option includes the return of your pet’s ashes to you, your vet will discuss the process to reunite you with your pet's ashes and the anticipated time frame during your appointment

### Will the vet examine my pet once they get to my home?

Yes, upon arrival the veterinarian will assess your pet. This can look different than an “nose to tail” examination in a clinic setting and will focus more on the pet’s history and quality of life.

### What if I am not sure it is time?

It is not uncommon to have doubts about whether the time is right. If you’ve taken the Quality of Life Questionnaire and are still unsure, we recommend consulting with your family veterinarian before scheduling an appointment.  
  
Rest assured, if you book an appointment, your in-home euthanasia veterinarian will let you know if they do not believe that euthanasia is appropriate at this time.

### How long will the procedure take?

You can expect your veterinarian to be in your home from 20-60 minutes, depending on how much of that time you need or want throughout the process.

### What is in home pet euthanasia, and how does it work?

In home pet euthanasia allows your pet to pass away peacefully in the comfort of your home surrounded by love. A compassionate veterinarian will provide end-of-life care for your pet starting with an initial end-of-life exam followed by sedation to ensure your pet is comfortable. Your vet will always move at your pace so you have the time you need to say your goodbyes. Once you are ready, your vet will administer medication to help them gently and painlessly say goodbye surrounded by comfort and love.

### How do I tell if my pet is suffering?

Recognizing pain and suffering in an animal can be challenging. Animals do not express pain in the same ways as humans, who will cry out, ask for help, shed tears, or generally draw attention to themselves. The wild instincts of our animal friends tell them that outward expressions of pain are dangerous. This is especially pronounced in cats, pocket pets, and exotics, who will hide pain for as long as possible. Recognizing what is normal when your pet is at peak health can help you recognize differences that may indicate that they are suffering. While every animal is different, there are common signs seen in most pets which can indicate that they are not feeling well, especially in combination.

> **Decrease in physical activity** \- While decreased activity can be part of normal aging, that does not mean it should be ignored. Especially if the change in physical activity is sudden. Many pets will choose to move less if they are in pain, and this may be the first change seen in animals with arthritis, muscle or tendon injury, or more serious conditions. If your pet is showing a decrease in activity, evaluation by a veterinarian can help identify issues which may improve their quality of life or identify serious conditions early.  
> 

> **Mobility** \- A decrease in physical activity to slowly or suddenly morph into a mobility issue. To have a good quality-of-life, pets need to be able to stand up, walk, and lie down on their own. This allows them to care for most basic bodily functions, including the ability to eat, drink, groom, relieve themselves, and to participate in activities they enjoy. Mobility issues can stem from neurological or musculoskeletal diseases, but regardless of cause, inability to move comfortably is a frustrating and painful experience for a pet.

> > **Extracurriculars** \- “He used to love chasing the ball,” and similar phrases are common to hear when I talk with clients about quality of life. While many of us recognize that loss of interest in hobbies can be a sign of suffering in humans, it may not be the first thing that comes to mind with our pets. However, mental stimulation and enjoyment of life are important to consider in an animal's quality-of-life. What are your pet's favorite things to do? Play fetch? Follow the kids upstairs? Go on walks? Play with their toys? Snuggle up with you in bed? Each pet is different. If an animal is no longer motivated to partake in the things they enjoy most, it is often an indication of pain or suffering.

> **Changes in appetite or diet** \- Some pets are picky grazers and others count the seconds to their next meal. It is usually easier to spot when something is “off” with the latter, but knowing and monitoring the eating habits of all pets is important. If they stop eating regularly or will only eat with "high motivation" food (special treats instead of their regular diet), this is often an indication that something is amiss. Many pets are not motivated to eat when they are uncomfortable. Animals with significant or total loss of appetite should be evaluated by a veterinarian.

> > **Changes in weight** \- Obesity is the top ranked health ailment of today's cats and dogs. Sometimes, sudden weight loss is initially thought to be a good thing. However, if your pet is losing weight with no change in daily physical activity or diet, something may be wrong. Many illnesses, especially in older animals, can cause weight loss by increasing calorie needs, reducing absorption of food, or changing their metabolism. Weighing your pet or assessing their body condition score regularly can help you track concerning trends in weight, as sometimes weight loss is not obvious in fluffy animals.

> > Poor coat/lack of grooming- A healthy animal usually has a full, thick, and shiny coat. Some species like cats or birds will groom or preen themselves as normal behavior. If your pet's coat starts to become dull, thin, less soft, or is losing hair, this can be a sign of declining health. A healthy animal can express the behaviors and process the nutrients it needs to maintain a good coat. Loss of grooming behavior and decline in coat quality are indicators that a pet is not well.

> > **Bathroom habits** -A healthy animal can control its bowels and go to the bathroom in their designated area without soiling themselves. Most species of animals kept as pets naturally keep bodily waste areas separate from their "living" areas, so if they now are unable to separate the two, it is a sign something is wrong. If a pet is incontinent or can no longer physically move to avoid soiling themselves, this is a serious problem. Soiling themselves can lead to urine scald, infections, and worse suffering. Some animals, especially dogs, may also suffer emotional distress from using the bathroom in the “wrong” area.

> > **Isolation** \- Isolation in normally social animals can be serious as this is a large indicator of pain. Common places to hide include under the bed, in a closet, behind the couch, or hard to access areas of the home. Isolation can indicate they are in so much pain, they just want to be left alone. If a normally social dog or cat starts isolating themselves, it is a red flag.  
> Behavioral Changes- There are other behaviors that can change in a pet when they are suffering. Sometimes, if a pet becomes painful they will become more aggressive to people they know or even start to bite. It can be their way of communicating, “I am in pain, please don’t touch me.” Diseases with a neurologic origins can cause abnormal behavior in pets. In old age, senility is a possibility as well. I often hear that an older pet seems to not recognize people, gets lost, seems confused, stands listlessly for long periods, can’t seem to relax, or is restless at night. If you notice behavioral changes in your animal, it is prudent to contact your veterinarian for a consultation.

### What should I do if my pet is declining fast?

If your pet's health is declining rapidly, it’s crucial to take the following steps:  


  * **Consult Your Veterinarian** : Schedule an appointment to discuss your observations and any scoring from a quality-of-life scale. This information can help guide the conversation about your pet's condition and options moving forward. Your vet may suggest palliative care, hospice, or, if necessary, euthanasia.  

  * **Ensure Comfort** : Create a quiet, cozy space with soft bedding and easy access to food, water, and a litter box (if applicable).  

  * **Minimize Stress** : Keep routines simple and familiar, and limit loud noises or disruptions.  

  * Offer Gentle Care: Provide a soothing touch through gentle petting and offer favorite treats if they can still eat.  

  * **Consider At-Home Euthanasia** : If appropriate, discuss the option of at-home euthanasia with your vet for a peaceful and familiar passing.  

  * **Reach Out for Support** : It's okay to lean on loved ones, pet-loss support groups, or counselors to help navigate this difficult time.



  
If you're noticing signs of declining health, we encourage you to use our [quality of life scale ](https://www.codapet.com/quality-of-life-scale)assessment to evaluate your pet's condition before your vet visit.

### What is the difference between in home pet euthanasia and euthanasia at a vet clinic?

The key difference is the setting. At home euthanasia allows your pet to pass peacefully in the comfort of their familiar surroundings, reducing stress and anxiety. This option especially benefits pets who may feel scared or uncomfortable traveling to a clinic. It also offers your family a private, intimate experience during this emotional time. While some urgent situations don’t allow for time to schedule in-home euthanasia, many pet owners in Stillwater choose in-home services for the peaceful atmosphere and compassionate care their pets receive right where they feel safest. You can [find flexible availability](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment) for our local vets here, or look for [same-day euthanasia](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request) appointments.

### Will my pet experience any pain during euthanasia?

No, pet euthanasia at home is designed to be completely painless. After an initial end-of-life assessment, your veterinarian will first administer a sedative to ensure your pet is relaxed and comfortable. The euthanasia medication then gently stops the heart without causing pain. The process is peaceful and allows your pet to pass without distress.

### How much does in home euthanasia cost for pets in my area?

At CodaPet, we believe in giving you complete transparency and control over what you are choosing for your pet’s end-of-life care. This is why you can view a detailed price estimate before you complete reserving a time with your local vet.

### Is the cost of euthanasia for dogs and cats the same?

Most providers in Stillwater charge a flat fee for euthanasia, although some providers do charge based on the size of your pet, so small dogs and cats can be the same price; however, medium or large-size dogs (such as Bulldogs, Australian Shepherds, Labradors, or German Shepherds) will likely carry a higher price. At CodaPet, most vets charge a flat fee for both dogs and cats; however, if there is a large pet fee, it will be applied automatically for you to review in the price estimate when you reserve an appointment. You can view the detailed [pricing and availability here](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment) or call us at **(833) 263 - 2738**.

### What should I expect during an in home pet euthanasia appointment?

Prior to their visit, the veterinarian may contact you to get a medical history so that they can plan for your visit. If you have any concerns or special needs, be sure to mention them. Please also let the veterinarian know if the animal has bitten anyone recently so they can plan to make the appointment as safe and stress-free as possible. We recognize that animals who are suffering may have changes in behavior and may lash out if they are in pain.The veterinarian will greet you at your door and will meet your pet. They will review the medical history of the animal with you and perform a minimally invasive physical exam. After they have evaluated the pet, the veterinarian will have a conversation with you about the process of humane euthanasia (rarely, they may recommend against euthanasia and will provide additional recommendations). Once the veterinarian and the responsible parties for the pet have agreed that they would like to move forward, the veterinarian will give you some time with your pet while they make preparations. The veterinarian will discuss aftercare options, including cremation and burial, and then will have you sign a form to confirm your choices and have you provide consent. Anyone present is welcome to ask questions at any point during or after the appointment. Based on their evaluation and the history of the animal, the veterinarian will craft a sedation and anesthetic protocol for the pet. Their goal is to keep the pet as comfortable as possible, so they can gently fall asleep in the comfort of their home with their family. After the pet has reached a deep enough plane of anesthesia, they will administer the euthanasia solution, which is essentially an overdose of an anesthetic agent which allows the body to come to rest and stop the heart. The family is welcome to be present or leave the room at any point during the procedure.

### How far in advance do I need to make an appointment?

The notice for every veterinarian differs, however, most veterinarians require at least a 3-hour notice from the time you need them to arrive at your home. This allows them time to prepare and ensure they can provide the highest level of care and compassion for your pet. It also accounts for their travel time, as your veterinarian may be traveling from many different locations around Stillwater.

  
While you can request a [same-day and emergency services](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request), it's always best to contact us as early as possible to ensure availability and to give both you and your veterinarian time to prepare for this important moment.

### What should I expect in terms of my pet’s behavior during the pet euthanasia process?

During the euthanasia process, your pet will be gently guided to a state of peace and comfort. After a sedative is administered, you can expect them to become calm and relaxed, free from any pain or distress. When the final injection is given, your pet will slowly drift off into a deep sleep before passing away peacefully. Your compassionate veterinarian will ensure the process is as gentle and serene as possible, allowing you to be present with your beloved companion in their final moments of love and care.

### Can I be with my pet during the euthanasia process?

Yes, during the in home euthanasia process, you are encouraged to be with your pet throughout the entire process. Being there provides comfort and reassurance to your pet as they pass peacefully.

### How do I know when it’s time to consider euthanasia for my pet?

Recognizing when your pet is suffering and deciding when it is “too much” can be a difficult, and very personal, decision. Sometimes change occurs quickly or all-at-once, and it is easy to make a decision. Other times change is gradual and it can be difficult to decide when their quality of life is no longer good enough. Even if you can logically list out reasons, euthanasia is still an emotional and extremely difficult decision. I find that it can be helpful to take an objective approach by preparing a list which includes basic life functions and your pet’s favorite things to do. Could they go down the stairs into the backyard today? Were they excited to play with their toy? At the very minimum, are they eating, drinking, able to move on their own, or go to the bathroom without soiling themselves or having accidents? Many owners find it helpful to track good days and bad days on a calendar, and decide to euthanize when they start having more bad days than good days. CodaPet has a [quality of life assessment](https://www.codapet.com/quality-of-life-scale) that gives an objective quality of life score, which can help you decide if your pet has a good quality of life, should be evaluated by your regular veterinarian, or has reached the point where humane euthanasia should be considered. There are other organizations with free quality of life assessments, as well. Regardless of how you measure it, when the negatives of daily life outweigh the positives, it can be a compassionate decision to consider humane euthanasia to relieve your pet’s suffering

### How should I prepare my home for my pet’s euthanasia?

Everyone’s experience in saying goodbye to their beloved companion is different and very personal. It’s important to consider that you know your pet best. Some considerations, however, are choosing a comfortable space where your pet feels safe, sometimes their favorite spot in your home. Another consideration can be to gather any family members who wish to be present and feel free to bring your pet’s favorite blanket or toys, etc that make them feel comfortable. When your veterinarian arrives they will guide you through each step in the process and help you move at your pace to ensure the process is as peaceful as possible.

### How long does the euthanasia procedure typically take?

The appointment usually takes between 30 minutes to an hour. Each pet is unique, illness can affect how quickly and effectively sedatives and anesthetics work, and sometimes it can take a little longer to make certain that they are not suffering. Your veterinarian will be present with you and your pet for as long as you need to ensure that you are comfortable with the decision and process.

### What should I do after the euthanasia procedure is completed?

After the euthanasia, you are welcome to spend as much time as you need with your pet to say goodbye. If you’ve chosen any cremation services to handle your pet’s body, your veterinarian will reconfirm your choices and gently transport your pet when you are ready. If you’ve chosen any keepsakes offered by the crematorium, like Claw Paw Prints, Ink nose prints, or other memorabilia, your veterinarian will reconfirm your choices before leaving your home. If you have any questions or want to change your mind about any of your choices, you can discuss your options with your veterinarian before they leave your home.

### What are my options for cremation?

After the in home euthanasia procedure, your veterinarian will provide you with time to say goodbye to your pet. Once you're ready, they will re-confirm the preferred aftercare option that you choose when reserving your time with your veterinarian. In Stillwater you can select two types of cremation services:  


  * **Individual Cremation (Ashes Returned)** : An individual cremation is a process where your pet will be cremated separated with physical barriers in the chamber. This ensures the separation with other pets in the chamber so you may reunite with your pet’s ashes. Your pet’s ashes will be returned to you in an urn of your choice. If you choose an additional urn then your pet’s ashes will be returned in the urn of your choice.  

  * **Communal Cremation (No Ashes Returned)** : A communal cremation is a process where your pet is cremated in a chamber with other pets. Once the process is complete, the crematorium will respectfully scatter your pet’s remains among other pets. It’s important to note, you pet’s ashes will not be returned to you.  




Some of our veterinarians offer an additional option known as **Private Cremation (Ashes Returned)**. In this option, only your pet is in the cremation chamber, ensuring that the recovered ashes are solely your pet's. These ashes can be returned in an urn of your choice, with additional urn options available. To see if private cremation is available with your provider, please refer to our [booking page](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment).

**Dr. Cara Gordon provides several cremation options for pet owners:  
"**_Clients have the option of individual cremation, communal cremation, or home burial. I use All Paws go to Heaven based in Guthrie. They are a privately-owned, small business, run by a kind and compassionate team. I visit their facility and am in contact with the employees on a regular basis. They go above and beyond to take care of my clients. They are animal lovers and understand how important it is that the remains of your pet are treated with dignity, and provide a number of options for urns or keepsakes if the family does not want all of the ashes returned. When I lost my own dog, they were the crematorium I trusted to take care of his remains, and they were wonderfully kind and respectful." -_ Dr.__ Cara Gordon, DVM  


**Note** : If you choose to leave your pet's body with your veterinarian, rest assured it will be handled with the utmost care, respect, and dignity. Your veterinarian will coordinate all aftercare arrangements as requested, allowing you to focus on yourself and your family after this difficult goodbye.

### How do I get my pet’s ashes back?

Your veterinarian will coordinate the return of your pet’s ashes before they leave your home. Your options include having your pet’s remains delivered by your veterinarian (for an additional fee), shipping them to you (for an additional fee), or picking them up from your primary clinic or the crematorium.

### Are there any low-cost or no-cost pet euthanasia solutions?

Saying goodbye to a beloved pet is never easy, and we understand that cost can be a concern for many pet parents. While we specialize in premium in-home euthanasia services, we also want to acknowledge that cost may be a concern. If you're looking for low-cost or no-cost pet euthanasia options in Stillwater, consider reaching out to the following:

  * **Local Animal Shelters & Humane Societies** – Many provide low-cost or donation-based euthanasia services, often with cremation options.  

  * **Low-Cost Veterinary Clinics & Nonprofits** – Some vet clinics and nonprofits offer reduced-cost euthanasia, sometimes supported by grants or donations.  

    * **Trinity Veterinary Hospital  
** 3100 N. Perkins Road, Stillwater, OK 74075  
405-533-0001  

  * **Animal Control Services** – In certain cases, local animal control agencies may offer euthanasia services for terminally ill or suffering pets at a lower cost.



**Note:** When considering a low-cost pet euthanasia option, it's important to call ahead to check availability, as some providers may require an appointment or have eligibility criteria, such as income-based assistance. Be sure to ask about additional costs, including cremation or aftercare services, which may not be included in the base price. Additionally, verify service details, as some options may have restrictions based on your pet’s size, health condition, or location.

While low-cost options are available, many pet parents choose in-home euthanasia to ensure a peaceful, stress-free farewell in the comfort of their home. If you're looking for a private, compassionate experience, we’re here to help.

> We had to make the incredibly hard decision to put our cat down, and Dr. Diana was truly wonderful. She was kind, compassionate, and never rushed us. She gave us the time and space we needed and treated our cat with such care and dignity. I especially appreciated that she brought a basket to carry our cat after she had passed. It was a small detail, but it meant a lot during such an emotional moment. I am very grateful for her gentleness and professionalism.

> Dr. Gordon came through for us in every way--compassionate, a good listener and able to explain the process clearly . Her communication was always open, timely and never was there a question unanswered about Pepper's in home euthanasia and the cremation process at a local Oklahoma facility. The most needed and appreciated part was the follow up by Dr Gordon, taking care in making sure our first days following were going ok. I suggest for potential clients to look at the CODA website and see what they have to offer. ( options, pricing, aftercare and veternarian bio) I am very happy with CODA and Dr Gordon.

> We had a 13 year old who was deteriorating rapidly and we wanted to help him before him started suffering. We contacted codapet who sent Dr. Cara Gordon who came to our house for in home pet euthanasia. I can’t imagine the experience is ever great, but Dr. Gordon was incredibly kind, gentle and sincere. She talked us through the procedure (as much as we wanted to) and was incredibly compassionate. I’m sorry for anyone that needs this service, but I can say that Dr. Gordon was an excellent person for this.

> Dr. Gordon is the absolute best. She is so kind and compassionate. Our dogs instantly loved her when she entered our home, and we know they are the best judge of character. A few weeks ago we had to put down our 16yo miniature dachshund, and then two weeks later we unexpectedly had to put down our 10yo lab. She explained everything, and made our dogs so comfortable through the process. I will never ever use a vet clinic again. She follows up with you after everything is completed, and she will respond anytime day or night if you need anything. She has this calming presence about her, and we can’t recommend her enough.

> We had a sudden need for home pet euthanasia for our beloved little dog, Jellybean. None of our local vets offered the service timely, so we had to try an unknown. I found CodaPet online and there were appointments available. Dr. Gordon at CodaPet was wonderful. The whole process went smoothly. Communication was thorough. She was a little late, but kept us updated (because you can't rush these things). She said all the right things and comforted us in our decision. We are heartbroken, but at least this part will be a good memory. Our pup was at home, peaceful, and not stressed out by being at the vet. We pet him, cried, told stories, and he just fell asleep. People who provide this service are special people. We SO appreciated being home for his final day. We would not hesitate to recommend Dr. Gordon if you unfortunately need this service.

> Words cannot express our gratitude and appreciation for the service that Dr. Mays and her company provided to our family. If and when the time comes to make that hurtful decision, Dr. Mays and the Coda company are the best to consider. Thanks once again for helping my family & me ease through this transition. Phd

> I have nothing but the highest respect for the care, patience, and dignity that doctor Cara Gordon displayed during her visit with our beloved dog, Jake. This was absolutely one of the hardest decision we have ever had to make, and it truly broke our hearts to do so. Dr. Cara was so extremely patient and kind to us, but most especially to Jake. You could tell in her actions that she truly loves animals and wanted the absolute best for us and for Jake. I hope to never have to go through this again, but if we do, Dr. Cara would be the only one I would want to go through this experience with. Thank you so much for the kindness and graciousness you showed Jake, my husband, and me. Lori Castle

> Our cat had reached the untreatable senior age of 18, and it meant a lot to say goodbye from the comfort of his home instead of taking him to the vet, where his last experience would've been stressful and upsetting for him. Interacting with Dr. Jessica was exactly what I was looking for during such a tough experience. Prompt, respectful, professional, and gentle. We thank her and CodaPet for their service.

> Meeting someone for the first time under such sad circumstances has the potential to be quite uncomfortable for all involved. Dr Gordon was caring, kind and empathic. This allowed me to grieve my loss in an accepting, unhurried environment. She took particular care to insure our sweet Hobie was comfortable and was able to cross the rainbow bridge in the love and embrace of his human, he so kindly adopted years before. Thank you, Dr Gordon.

> Losing a fur baby is devastating. Dr. Laurie Noe aided us through the difficult and emotional pain of saying goodbye. She was kind, patient, compassionate, answered our questions and treated our Hank with love and respect. This was our first time using in-home euthanasia and will do so with our remaining pets. It was a personal & loving way to say goodbye.

And she is with you and your pet throughout the whole process, explaining and going at your pace. I couldn’t have asked for a better Dr. Thank you Dr Cassandra

> Using CodaPet was so easy; from searching for a vet near me to clear pricing. Once booked they remained in constant communication with me throughout the process, providing time updates, etc. Our family was matched with Dr.Kelsey Jones and I can not recommend her enough. She arrived promptly, listened to our concerns, examined our furbaby Ciddy and gave us ample time to grieve and make the final decision. At no moment did I feel pressured to rush. She gave us time to set up an area outside and spoke to us like a friend throughout the process, while treating all of us with respect and compassion. She even made a suggestion on how to allow our other dog to say goodbye (which I would never have thought of). It’s not an easy choice to let go of a beloved pet but i feel this was the best way to do it and highly recommend her services.

She is so kind and respectful and she values the love you two share. I highly suggest that if you are considering this option you let Dr. Amanda help you.

> After making the difficult decision to help our elderly bulldog cross the rainbow bridge, we found CodaPet online, offering in-home euthanasia. Our dog was a large breed and could hardly walk, and I couldn’t bear the thought of transporting her to a cold clinic for her final moments with us. Dr. Michelli arrived at our home and was so kind and gentle with our sweet girl; she explained to us how things would work and gave us time to answer any questions. We were so thankful to be able to say our final goodbyes to our fur baby in the privacy of our home and with her in the comfort of her own bed. Our hearts are broken by the loss, but I couldn’t have wished for a better way to have gone about this experience. Thank you, Dr. M and CodaPet. 🙏🏻🌈

> Dr. Orth was wonderful! She responded very quickly, which seemed like a miracle for us. She was very thorough and kind with our distressed older cat. She quickly assessed our cat Ronnie and agreed it was time. She explained what she would do and what would happen. She was very gentle and kind with our pet. She arrived totally prepared and acted to calm Ronnie and make the visit as comforting as possible. We can’t say enough good things about her professionalism and kindness to our pet and my husband and me. It’s very clear she loves animals. We would highly recommend her to help your cat in Sanger, CA area.

> Dr. Cara Gordon with Coda Pet embodies the epitome of compassionate care and patience. From the moment she stepped into our house, she greeted my family with empathy, setting the tone for a truly remarkable experience. Dr. Gordon’s genuine love for animals shines through in every interaction, as she took the time to listen attentively to our concerns and addressed them with utmost care. Her patience knows no bounds, whether it's answering endless questions or soothing nervous pets or handling my young kids decide whether or not they wanted to be in the room. She was patient and so kind to our family. She had a remarkable ability to ease our minds and reassured us that Mavrick was no longer going to be in pain and we were doing the right thing. In times of uncertainty and difficult decisions, Dr. Gordon provided unwavering support and guidance, offering empathy and understanding every step of the way. I would absolutely recommend this service to anyone. This experience has been so helpful in our grieving process. Mavrick was our black lab/chow mix and he 15 years old and traveled the world with us while we served in the Military. We are so thankful for Dr Cara Gordon.

> Dr. Clark could not have been a more kind, compassionate and patient veterinarian. He’s also very experienced and made what I expected to be a traumatic experience (in home pet euthanasia) as peaceful as it could be and I will be forever grateful for that. I felt awful that I waited a day or two too long before making the decision, but having Dr. Clark be the one to help us was the right choice. We’ll now be taking our other dog to his practice for care.

> Cara seemed very caring and had a calm presence. The issue was the first medicine out of three that were administered. It was an oral med and must have tasted awful to Lily. She freaked out and had a terrified look on her face, and was trying desperately to get the taste out of her mouth. It took several minutes for her to calm down so Cara could go on with the other two steps. What should have been a calm death in our home for Lily instead was horrifying for her and for my wife and me. We have had two dogs and three cats euthanized at the vet, and this has never been an issue before. I would not recommend Coda until they change protocol.

> Dr. Gordon was very kind and understanding during this terrible time. She showed us compassion and made our precious fur babies last moments at peace with us by her. Bentley wasn't scared and she worked around us and talked to us to help keep us at is. This is not something anyone wants to go through. But being able to spend those last moments at home with her instead of being in a vets office will always be something I appreciate that this service offers and would recommend to any pet owner. Dr. Gordon was very responsive and when things got worse quickly she adjusted her appointment to visit us earlier so that Bentley didn't have to suffer more than she was. I am grateful for the care she took of our sweet baby.

From the moment she arrived, we felt respected—not only in our home, but throughout the entire process. I didn’t even realize in-home euthanasia was an option, and I can honestly say the experience was as peaceful and comforting as it could possibly be. Her compassion made an unbearable moment feel gentle and dignified. We will always be thankful.

I had never heard of this service before and my friend recommended it. Hands down this is the only way i will ever do this again. The gratitude i have for Dr. Alex and her service cannot be understated. I was very moved by the experience. My kitty had zero stress; i placed her on my lap while i sat on the bed. Dr. Alex was so gentle and kind. I cannot praise enough. Thank you so much.
