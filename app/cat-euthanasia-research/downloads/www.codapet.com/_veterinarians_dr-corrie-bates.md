Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I've always felt the passing of our beloved pets deserves more time than is possible in the clinic setting and also our beloved companions deserve to have their last moments in their safe space not the sometimes anxiety producing veterinary clinic for some pets. Additionally, I encourage pet owners going through this difficult time to share a few words or stories of their beloved companions and even choose song(s) to play. I am sensitive to any cultural, religious or spiritual ceremonial aspects that owners may want to include to help honor their pet on their final passage.

## What pet parents are saying

> Dr. Bates was wonderful during her visit. She was caring, gentle, and reassuring throughout the whole process, easing our worries and explaining each step. I could tell just how much she cared, about us and our pet. She really made a very difficult time so much easier, and for that, I can't thank her enough.

> Dr. Bates was a compassionate and steady presence during one of the hardest moments our family could face. By coming to our home, she created a peaceful, familiar space where our pet could be surrounded by love and comfort. Her calm guidance, kindness, and respect for both our beloved dog, who had been a cherished part of our family for 14 years, and our family made the experience as gentle as possible. In a moment filled with emotion, Dr. Bates offered dignity, empathy, and genuine care, helping our cherished companion pass peacefully. We will always remember her thoughtful presence and the comfort she brought to our family during this difficult time. Her support helped us find peace and healing as we said goodbye to a beloved member of our family.
