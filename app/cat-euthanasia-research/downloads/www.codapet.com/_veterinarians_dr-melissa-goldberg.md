Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

Like many veterinarians, this career is a calling for me. I decided upon this profession when I was only seven years old. I never wanted to do anything else, so this defined my educational path. In private practice, I have sometimes had the opportunity to provide in-home euthanasia for clients who requested it. Most of the time, though, euthanasia was done in the hospital. While it is truly one of the hardest parts of my job, I believe that providing a peaceful passing to our four-legged family members is one of the most important things that I can do. I believe that our pets are most comfortable in their own environment, surrounded by those who love them most. After all, isn't that the most that any of us could wish for? I am honored to be able to provide a modicum of peace and comfort at a very difficult time.

> Dr. Goldberg was amazing. Made me feel like i made the right choice for my girl. She recognized the urgency of the situation and made sure to move quickly so Mable did not have to suffer anymore than she already had. The in home service was amazing, stress free for both Mable and myself I appreciate everything Dr Goldberg did and would recommend her to anyone going through this situation with a pet.

It was a really sweet touch that she reached out afterwards by text and by sending a card with condolences. Thank you Dr. Melissa Goldberg, you made a really difficult moment as painless as possible for us. -Clara & Jeff

> Dr. Melissa was caring and professional. She made one of the hardest days a lot easier to cope with. Being able to send our Katie off to her next place at home instead of at an office made her last time special and calming. Dr. Melissa was so stealthy and professional she didn’t alarm our Katie at any point. I recommend her services if and when you have to make this hard decision. She will make it hurt a little less. Thank you Dr. Goldberg… Ed, Linda and Katie

> Dr Goldberg was caring and kind. She was sweet to Coz and asked us questions about his life with us. We never felt like just a client. Letting your very best friend is the most difficult thing and Dr Goldberg was sensitive to that. She reassured us we were doing the right thing after examining him. She took things slow giving us time with him throughout the process, but at the same time moving things along appropriately as not to make it any more agonizing. After that day, she kept in touch letting us know where in the cremation process our boy was. We were able to pick up his remains the moment they came available to Dr. Goldberg. She truly understands how hard it is to say goodbye to a beloved pet. She is a very compassionate vet and we truly appreciated her kindness on such an awful day.

> Dr. Goldberg was fantastic. We couldn't have asked for a better experience for our girl. No one wants to reach the day where euthanasia services are needed, but having arrived, the process was as peaceful as it could have possibly been. Our senior girl got all the treats and pets and love, she didn't even notice the injection of the sedative, and then she just went to sleep. It was a rough day for us, but as peaceful as could be for her. Dr. Goldberg was professional, kind, caring, offered additional comfort services we didn't require, and once everything was finished she quietly let herself out. She even sent us a very sweet card in the mail afterwards. Highly recommend her service for anyone in need.

> Even though we didn’t want to say goodbye to our beloved Collins, Dr Melissa was wonderful. Collie was struggling , Dr Melissa graciously came earlier than our appointment time, explained everything she was doing, assured us it wasn’t hurting Collins but relieving her of pain- she just made the inevitable more bearable. She gave us as much time as we needed with our pooch & cried right along with us. I was thankful we decided to go with CodaPet, it was easier for Collins to be at home with all of her family surrounding her. She left us peacefully, which was a major relief after so much worrying about her. It was heartbreaking and beautiful at the same time. We were given more time with our Collie girl before Dr Melissa allowed our kids to get her ready to leave us. They carried her on a stretcher, where she was tucked in ever so carefully, to her car where she was treated respectfully and with love. I can’t begin to tell you how thoughtful Dr. Goldberg was through the before, during and after process.

> It was obvious from the beginning that Melissa was a caring and compassionate person. We knew it was going to be a sad, hard day to experience; but from the moment Dr. Goldberg arrived, she made us all comfortable, including Dark Vader. She made letting go of my cat of more than 16 years a bit easier. I would highly recommend her to anyone who needs to say goodbye to their pet in a gentle, caring way.

> My experience with Otis, our 16-year-old Rottweiler, and in-home pet euthanasia was one of the most compassionate and dignified ways we could have said goodbye. We live in Philly, and since we have a large dog in the city without a car, we often worried about what to do as Otis aged. As his mobility declined—needing support to urinate, struggling with bowel movements, and requiring assistance up the stairs twice a day—we knew it was time. After searching for at-home euthanasia services, we found CodaPet and Dr. Melissa Goldberg. Initially nervous about making the appointment, I scheduled it on a Thursday for that Sunday morning. Dr. Goldberg arrived right on time, and from the moment she walked in, we felt a sense of relief. G*d definitely sent her to us. She was compassionate, patient, and walked us through every step of the process. We chose to have the procedure done on our sofa, where Otis loved to sleep. We had set up sheets and pads on the chaise, making it feel like a hospital bed. When Dr. Goldberg arrived, Otis even mustered a bark to greet her. My wife and I, along with our other dog, Dani, and any of our four cats who wanted to say goodbye, were able to be there with him. Dr. Goldberg explained each step, starting with a sedative to help Otis relax, followed by Propofol to anesthetize him about five minutes later. The final medication was administered shortly after, and Otis passed peacefully in his favorite spot, surrounded by his family. We've had many pets over the years, saying goodbye in different ways—at the vet's office or with our regular vet at home—but this was, by far, the most peaceful and compassionate experience we've ever had. I cannot praise Dr. Goldberg and CodaPet enough. They provided thoughtful follow-up emails, and we even received a heartfelt sympathy card from Dr. Goldberg. She also took care of Otis’s aftercare, bringing a stretcher so I could walk him to her car. Knowing that CodaPet and veterinarians like Dr. Goldberg exist gives us great comfort for when we face this difficult decision again. Five stars all the way. We are so grateful that Otis had her gentle presence to guide him across the Rainbow Bridge—where I imagine an "Old Home Day" reunion with all his previously passed fur siblings.

> Dr. Goldberg was wonderful to us on one of the most difficult day in our lives. She was compassionate, caring, and gave us all the time we needed to ensure we gave our lovely boy, Iago, the dignity and passing he deserved after 17+ years with our family. I cant recommend her enough to anyone who has to make this heartbreaking decision. He was fortunately having a good day on his last with us, and Dr. Goldberg offered an extra step in the process to make sure he was as comfortable as he could possibly be, and that also caused us the least distress possible (which is saying a lot). we are so glad we chose to go with Coda Pet and Dr. Goldberg, she was a godsend for us on what was otherwise a incredibly difficult day for our entire family. She helped us give our loved pet the dignity he deserved, and we are relieved he is no longer in pain. She sent the most heartfelt hand written note to us a few days after and it was so wonderful to read what she wrote. I canot recommend her enough.

> At-Home pet euthanasia When the time came to say goodbye to my beloved English Bulldog, the thought of taking him to a clinic for his final moments was heartbreaking. I am eternally grateful to Dr. Melissa Goldberg for bringing her exceptional care and compassion directly to my home. She arrived alone, yet her presence filled the room with a profound sense of calm and understanding, making an incredibly difficult situation a little more bearable. From the moment Dr. Goldberg stepped through my door, she exuded a quiet strength and empathy. She spoke to me with genuine kindness, acknowledging my grief and offering clear, gentle explanations of the process. There was no rush; she allowed me all the time I needed to be with Hitchcock and say my goodbyes in the comfort and familiarity of his own home. What truly set Dr. Goldberg apart was her incredibly gentle approach with Hitchcock. She handled him with such tenderness, ensuring he was relaxed and comfortable in his own bed. It was clear that she possessed not only remarkable veterinary expertise but also a deep understanding of the emotional bond between pets and their families. She made sure Hitchcock's final moments were peaceful and serene, free from any stress. This gift of a tranquil farewell, delivered in the privacy of my home, brought me immense comfort during my deepest sorrow. I am incredibly thankful for Dr. Goldberg's compassionate house-call service. Her dedication to providing such a personal and dignified experience for both pets and their owners is truly extraordinary. I wholeheartedly recommend her to anyone seeking a veterinarian who combines professional excellence with profound empathy, especially during such a sensitive time. Ann Pearlman
