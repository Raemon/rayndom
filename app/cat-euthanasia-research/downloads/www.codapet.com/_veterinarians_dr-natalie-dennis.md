Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I offer in-home euthanasia and end-of-life consultations because I care deeply not just for animals, but for the people who love them. Being invited into this sacred moment within the comfort of a family's home, allows me to honor the human-animal bond in the most compassionate way possible. I believe every pet deserves to pass peacefully at-home, free from fear or pain, and every family deserves comfort, clarity, and dignity during this very difficult goodbye. By helping pet owners recognize the loving choice in ending suffering, I’m here to support and empower them through one of life’s hardest decisions with gentleness, presence, and peace.

> There are no words to describe how kind, compassionate, understanding, and overall amazing Dr. Natalie Dennis was. I work with animals so I fully understand how hard her job is offering euthanasia services, it can take an emotional toll on anyone, but she handles it so gracefully making sure not only your fur baby but you are also comfortable and okay during the entire process. It is extremely difficult to make this decision for your pet but making this decision with Dr. Dennis was the best thing I could’ve done for my old lady❤️ thank you Dr. Dennis for caring so much. We will never forget everything that you did

> Words are not enough to describe just how kind, compassionate, knowledgeable, and supportive Dr. Dennis is. This service was a gift. I was able to keep my dog at home free from anxiety of the vet’s office and free from the impressment of crying at the vets office. My fur baby went peacefully and pain-free. If I could give 10 stars I would. Thank you so much Dr. Dennis. You’ll never know how much this meant to me.

> Dr. Dennis was extremely compassionate and kind as she helped us say goodbye to our beloved cat. Our cat had some trouble absorbing the sedation and she was so patient and caring throughout the entire process. Highly recommend her and her services, at-home euthanasia was a much better option than stressing our cat out by putting him in a car to go to an office. He was able to pass peacefully at home where he was comfortable and surrounded by us and our other cats. Very grateful to Dr. Dennis for everything she did to help our cat pass peacefully, and to help our little family process our loss ❤️‍🩹

> Natalie Dennis, DVM, with CodaPet came to my house in Las Cruces and helped gently transition my beloved 12-year-old Labrador retriever. She was incredibly knowledgeable, skilled, and well equipped, as well as compassionate with my girl and empathetic to me. I've now outlived four dogs in my life, and this experience was by far the least emotionally painful and most caring and respectful. Thank you so much Natalie for all your support in what was such a trying time for me.

> I can’t begin to express how grateful we are to CodaPet and Dr. Natalie Dennis for making one of the hardest moments of our lives so much more peaceful and comforting. When it came time to say goodbye to our beloved dog Tedi after 16 beautiful years, we were devastated, but Dr. Dennis showed such incredible compassion and care. She was not only professional, but she truly understood the emotional weight of the moment. She took the time to explain everything and answered all of our questions, making us feel completely at ease with the process. The fact that they came to our home made all the difference. We were able to be in the comfort of our own space, surrounded by familiar sights and smells, which made saying goodbye just a little bit easier. Dr. Dennis spent as much time as we needed with Tedi, letting us say our goodbyes and offering us the comfort of knowing that Tedi was being treated with the utmost respect and dignity. The level of care, compassion, and professionalism that CodaPet and Dr. Dennis showed during this incredibly difficult time will never be forgotten. If you’re ever in this heart-wrenching situation, we cannot recommend their services enough. They truly make a painful process as peaceful as it can possibly be. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.

> Dr. Natalie Dennis is a kind, caring person which makes her work as an in-home veterinarian so vital to those whose animals cannot make the trip to the vet across town because of health or mobility issues. Dr. Dennis facilitated the euthanizing of our 90 pound dear German Shepherd who had cancer. The process was peaceful and quiet. She cared not only for the dog, but for the humans who would dearly miss him. If you need to think about euthanizing your animal, though it is hard to do, Dr. Dennis achieved this task with grace.

> Compassionate option for euthanasia. Dr. Dennis performed the process with efficiency and most of all, with care - for my pet as well as for me personally. Because this was performed in our own home, my dog was relaxed and went to “sleep” naturally and comfortably.

> Dr. Dennis was fantastic from the time we made the appointment to the final moments of her taking our pet to the mortuary. She contacted us the day before to let us know she was available to change the appointment time if we needed her earlier than we set up. She also kept in touch with us the day of. When she got to our house she interacted with both of our dogs along with telling us what to expect and to ask any questions at any time. She was so professional and caring to us and our pets. She was so kind to Madison at the end. She is a blessing for helping us during this sad time for us. I would recommend her for anyone that would be in need of a in home passing of their pet.

> Dr Natalie Dennis was very compassionate and understanding in my time of grief. What I expected was that she would come into my home give my best friend a shot or two and then be gone. What actually happened is when she arrived we sat with my buddy as I shared stories of his birth and his 14 years together with me. I shared pictures with her of him and describe to her what made him the best dog a person could ever have. Several times I apologized for taking so much of her time and she always had the same responces, its ok take your time she would say. There is no rush whenever you are ready. He was really an amazing friend to you etc. I never felt rushed and was made to feel that I was in control of the timing throught the process. She told me the cremation would take about a week. The very next day she called to tell me she would be returning my buddy's remains the next day. I would say Dr Natalie Dennis made the experience the best it could possibly be considering the circumstances.

> "The absolute worst day was maybe a little better thanks to Dr. Dennis." I've never had to decide to ease my pet's pain and suffering. Let alone for my dog Sassy, who introduced me to my wife and helped us build such a beautiful life and family together. I was back and forth with the decision, but finally got enough courage to make the call to help my friend move on to her next part of life. Dr. Natalie Dennis was absolutely heaven-sent during this decision I had to make. The actual procedure was great, and Sassy was comfortable and was able to pass with dignity and grace in the comfort of her home. The most important thing that needs to be highlighted is the care Dr. Dennis provided me and the family. It felt like welcoming a friend into our home. She was caring and thoughtful and asked to hear stories about Sassy's life. It wasn't an easy decision, but I expected my friend to be taken care of, I didn't expect me and my family to be taken care of and supported in the way she did. A thousand thank yous to Dr. Dennis, truly an angel.

> Dr. Natalie is beyond amazing. She took the saddest day of our lives and made it special, complete with stories and laughter and just all-around conversation taking us out of the moment but always keeping us present in the reason she was there. My girl was 17 and worked from home with me and we were able to say our goodbyes in our office where she was at home and comfortable and safe and cherished. Thank you, Dr. Natalie for such a confusing experience LOL. Making a hard day easy is by no means an easy task but you accomplished it for us. Thank you

> We had hoped that our beloved “pup,” Bella would pass peacefully in her sleep but it was evident she was struggling and in pain. She had lived for 15 years, 2 months, and 4 days and gave us all the joy and love she had. We needed to understand that we, in turn needed to love her enough to send her on her next journey. It was time to seek in home pet euthanasia. Bella’s veterinarian only performed euthanasia in her clinic and recommended Dr. Natalie Dennis at CodaPet. We made an appointment for the next day. It is certain that Dr. Natalie Dennis is an “angel,” she made us feel as comfortable as possible with our decision. She took the time with us that we needed. She explained the procedure and went through each step in detail that would make sure Bella would pass peacefully. She answered all of our questions. Dr. Dennis was compassionate and gentle with our Bella. We believe it was providence that sent Dr. Natalie Dennis to us. Dr. Natalie Dennis, DVM is absolutely phenomenal. If you ever have to make this decision, we highly recommend her. She gets many more than five stars from us.

> For those that have had to consider euthanasia for their beloved pet, it is one of the most difficult decisions to make. Unfortunately, we had to make this decision and were looking for a way to have the procedure performed at home so that our beloved girl could leave this earth in her own bed surrounded by those that love her and provide us the peace of mind of knowing that she felt no pain in the process. We were fortunate to have found the CodaPet service (www.codapet.com). They provide “in home pet euthanasia” services for your dog or cat. Once you select the details of your beloved pet, a veterinarian is assigned for your local area and they come and visit you at your house to perform the procedure. We were so honored and blessed to have been assigned Dr. Natalie Dennis. She truly is a loving and dedicated pet parent, who explained that she was inspired to perform these services because of having a difficult time in the past with one of her pet children. She was extremely kind, caring and gentle, not only with our beloved girl, but with us and our other dogs and took the time to get to know her, and us as well. She got us laughing and remembering some wonderful times we had with her. When the time arrived, she performed the procedure and our girl quietly drifted away like so many afternoon naps. She looked so peaceful and content when she passed over the rainbow bridge. We are so thankful and grateful for Dr. Natalie and the service she performed. She made the difficult decision that much easier. We hope and pray that others will support her in her mission to provide a compassionate and tranquil exit to pet parents of their beloved pets.

> We prefer at home euthanasia for all our pets and coming from Dallas we were worried there wouldn't be these types of services in LC. I'm glad we found Dr. Dennis and CodaPet to help us with our 15 yr old gal who wasn't doing too well since she was diagnosed with stage 4 CKD. She was able to pass with us and her fur siblings by her side stress free and comfortable. Thank you for being with us during this difficult time and also assisting with her cremation. We truly appreciated your kindness and compassion for us during that difficult time!
