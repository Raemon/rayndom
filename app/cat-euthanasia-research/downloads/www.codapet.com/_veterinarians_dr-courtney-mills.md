Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

As a young girl, I knew two things for certain: I wanted to pursue a career in the medical field, and I wanted to help those who couldn’t help themselves. This guiding principle led me to veterinary medicine. Early in my career as a general practitioner in San Diego, I found myself drawn to the most vulnerable patients—those nearing the end of their lives. I began connecting deeply with families, offering a safe space to openly and honestly discuss quality of life, quality of death, grief, loss and love. When I realized that the traditional clinical setting was limiting my ability to fully support my clients and patients, I transitioned in 2020 to focus exclusively on end-of-life care. Helping families give their beloved pets the gift of a passing that is peaceful, loving and dignified has become my life’s work.

## What pet parents are saying

> Dr Mills is an amazing human being. She so very caring, compassionate and comforting! Her time with us was incredible, she explained everything in detail, she love on our sweet boy to help him feel comfortable and relaxed. She talk with me, answered my questions and made me feel comfortable with my decision to let my sweet boy go. It was his time and I didn’t want him to suffer any longer. I was extremely happy to be able to do this in my home where we were both comfortable. I HIGHLY recommend Dr.Mills if you have to say goodbye to your furbaby!

> Thank you, Dr. Mills for giving the best dog in the world the send off she deserved. Even one night of watching her struggle was too much, being able to let her pass peacefully, surrounded by her humans, at home with her smelly cats, was definitely the passing she earned for 15 years of being the best dog and most gentle soul to ever walk the earth. The decision to end a life that provided mine with so much comfort, support, unwavering love and devotion was not an easy or light one to make, but Dr. Mills was kind enough to make sure that I knew i had chosen correctly and in my own heart, I already knew it, too. Thank you Dr. Mills for your kindness to not only Bailey, but myself.

> Dr Courtney Mills was excellent. She is very loving, explained what was going to happen clearly, allowed both of our dogs to become comfortable with her before she did anything. She said it best, her job was to be as gentle as possible. She was. CodaPet made the whole process easier.

> It has been a few months since Dr. Mills helped our sweet Oté cross the Rainbow Bridge, but I want to help anyone who may need her services to know that she is the most gentle soul I have encountered. Oté knew it too. She took her time and made sure he was comfortable, but she also took time to comfort us as we navigated this difficult time with him. If you need this service, Dr. Mills is an amazingly kind soul and will make the process as comfortable as possible.

> Cournety Mills is an angel. Our Kenji was very sick, but kept himself alive for us. It was time to allow him to let go, so we decided for a quiet, in-home euthenasia. Courtney arrived on time and immediately went to where he was laying to interact with him and assure him. Her compassionate and considerate approach and the calm way she carefully explained every step was what we needed. We sat with Kenji and spent the final minutes with him wrapped in his fvorite blanket. The end was peacful. Courtney made the unbearable bearable. We cannot speak highly enough about her.

> Dr. Mills is very compassionate and made our experience feel as good as she possibly could. This was our first time ever doing an at-home euthanasia so we did not know what to expect, but Dr. Mills was very thorough and took her time explaining the process and allowing us to take as much time as we needed.
