Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I always knew that animals made such an impact on my heart and caring for them would have to a big part of my life. I followed that dream and became a veterinarian. It is such a privilege to be able to give a pet a peaceful passing and to help their people through that time. Doing this in the comfort of their own home makes it even more special.

## What pet parents are saying

> Dr Erin was the best. It’s heartbreaking to make the decision to end your pets suffering but I highly recommend at home euthanasia. She made it an experience we will never forget. I have already given a few friends the information as they also have senior pets. Thank you Dr Erin for your professionalism and kindness at that difficult time.

> We made the difficult choice to say goodbye to our 15-year-old cat Leo who had developed an aggressive cancer, and I'm so glad we went with Coda and Dr. Erin. I began looking into at-home pet euthanasia options when Leo's health took a turn. Traveling to the vet was always a stressful experience for him, and that's not how I wanted his last moments to feel. Dr. Erin was unbelievably kind and compassionate, both toward Leo and us. She walked us through the process of sedation and then the final injection, helped us pick a comfortable location, gave Leo some final treats, and then began the process. It was very quick - only a few minutes - but it was peaceful, exactly the experience we wanted for our little guy. After Leo passed, Dr. Erin gave us some time alone to say goodbye. She then wrapped him in a blanket within a basket and carried him out, looking like he was taking a nice nap. I have absolutely no regrets and it made a challenging moment so much easier - I highly recommend this option and specifically Dr. Erin.

> Helping my fur baby cross the rainbow bridge was one of the most difficult choices I had to make. With the help of Dr Erin Scaglione and CodaPet, they made this day as comfortable as possible not only for me and my family, but for my sweet beautiful boy Harley. Harley was 11 years old, and in recent months his health started declining and I knew I would need to make a very difficult choice soon. I reached out to several veterinarians, inquiring about in-home euthanization and to gather as much information as I could, to try and prepare myself, but to be honest, you are never ready for this. CodaPet took the time to explain all the options, and showed extreme compassion, taking the time to explain everything and answer all the questions I had. I wanted Harley to be as comfortable as possible, in a surrounding he was most familiar with, with the people that loved him, I knew In home euthanization was the BEST option. Dr Erin was so caring and compassionate when she arrived, especially to my sweet boy. At that point I knew we were in good hands. Knowing that Harley is no longer in pain and that he is at peace, makes it a little less painful. We hold the beautiful memories of Harley very close to our heart, we miss him and love him very much.🐾🌈❤️

> Dr. Erin was very kind and compassionate. Obviously, putting a beloved pet down is not an easy decision but the process was straightforward. I was very glad I did not have to subject my 20 year old cat to a car ride or vet’s office and that I was able to grieve privately.

> Casper was not letting anyone near him for 2 days. Erin arrived and he immediately took to her. After she relieved his pain (first shot), he started to finally take treats from my wife and my hand. It felt that he allowed us to say goodbye. I wish I could give her unlimited stars. She gave us the gift of reconnecting to Casper one last time.

> Would not recommend this platform. Serious nickel and dime fees including undisclosed fees that get tacked on AFTER you agreed to pay. Suddenly when you get your invoice you have undisclosed fees for shipping for example. In the photo attached, I have blacked out my information but you notice that they have NO disclosure of that in the total price when you enter your credit card. Also AFTER entering my credit card and AGREEING to the charges, they tack on tax which they make no mention about. On top of that they provide the least amount of service compared to other options. This is PLUS a travel fee, a platform fee and then if you want ANYTHING - a paw print, an urn, etc its is EXTRA. This is UNLIKE any other mobile pet euthanasia offering which bundles or includes bare minimums. Its a bait and switch here when AFTER you have already PUT YOUR PET DOWN, they start adding UNDISCOLSED fees. Will be reporting to the AG of my state. Would NOT recommend.

> We were devastated when it became time to say goodbye to our sweet dog, Harley, but Dr. Erin's kindness, compassion, and professionalism made this incredibly difficult moment a little more bearable. From the moment she arrived, Dr. Erin's gentle approach and understanding nature reassured us that Harley was in good hands. She took the time to explain the entire process to us in a calm and empathetic way, answering all of our questions and helping us understand what to expect. She made sure that Harley was comfortable and at peace, and she treated him with such tenderness, making sure he was never in pain. It was clear that Dr. Erin truly cares for animals, and her presence helped us feel supported in our grief. Saying goodbye is never easy, but we will always be grateful to Dr. Erin for helping us through this heartbreaking moment with so much dignity and love for our beloved pet. Thank you for your professionalism and for showing so much kindness during one of the hardest times of our lives.

> My little girl had a stroke or something and could not get up on her own or walk more than a few steps without falling. Since she was always scared and shaking at the vet we decided on in home euthanasia. I called Codapet and scheduled the appointment. The lovely young vet came to our home, tsked to us about Sugars condition. She reassured us that Sugar was in pain as she was crying alot. The vet gave her a tranquilizing shot and she went into a peaceful sleep, then administered the medication that stopped her heart. She then examined her for heartbeat or pulse to make sure it was final and left the room for us to have a private moment with our dog. She came back with a small gurney, wrapped Sugar gently in s blanket and placed her on the gurney to take her away for cremation. The whole process was very dignified and although we were grieving , we were glad she was no longer in pain. I highly recommend it for those who want a peaceful passing of their pet in the comfort and security of their own home.

> Dr. Erin couldn’t have been more kind, compassionate, caring and gentle with us and our pup. This has undoubtedly been one of the biggest losses and most traumatic choices I have ever had to make, however, Dr. Erin’s professionalism and grace made our experience one where we felt safe in our grief and knowing our boy wasn’t in pain as he passed. Eternally grateful. Thank you.

> Dr. Erin was absolutely incredible during the most heartbreaking moment of our lives. From the moment she arrived, she treated Skywalker with such gentleness and respect and she spoke to us with kindness and compassion every step of the way. She took the time to ask about his life, his favorite things and his journey with us. In such a difficult situation, I can’t imagine anyone being more understanding and caring than Dr. Erin. Thank you, Dr. Erin, for your professionalism, your warmth, and for that hug in the end when we needed it most.
