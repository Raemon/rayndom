# Understanding Cat Diabetes

[Dr. Karen Whala](/experts/dr-karen-whala)

August 20, 2023

Diabetes in cats occurs when the body is unable to respond to a hormone called insulin, resulting in the inability to metabolize glucose. Glucose is the body’s primary source of energy.

## **What is Cat Diabetes?**

Diabetes in cats, like in humans, occurs when the body is unable to respond to a hormone called insulin, resulting in the **inability to metabolize glucose**. Glucose is the body’s primary source of energy; this sugar results from the body breaking down food into smaller simpler compounds. Once glucose is detected in the bloodstream, a healthy cat’s body releases insulin which “unlocks” the cells ushering the glucose inside to provide the cell, and the body, with energy. 

In diabetic patients, the body either does not produce adequate amounts of insulin or the insulin is unable to act upon the cells appropriately to give glucose entry to the cells. As a result, the glucose levels in the diabetic cat’s bloodstream increase and **remain high for prolonged periods** of time leading to various other health issues all the while the **cells remain undernourished**. Simply put, diabetes is a disease in which the **body starves** despite high levels of sugar remaining in the bloodstream, within reach but inaccessible.

## **Types of Diabetes in Cats**

Cats can primarily be affected by two types of diabetes:

  * **Type I Diabetes** : This condition, albeit rare in cats, occurs when the blood glucose is elevated because the pancreas does not produce enough insulin. It is also referred to as insulin-deficient diabetes (IDD).
  * **Type II Diabetes** : This is the more common type of diabetes in cats. It occurs when the blood glucose is elevated because the cells in the cat's body respond poorly to the insulin it has produced. It is also referred to as insulin-resistant diabetes (IRD).



In either case, the cells cannot access the glucose in the blood, leading to prolonged hyperglycemia and cells depleted of glucose, their primary energy source. Approximately 0.2% - 1% of cats will suffer from feline diabetes. It is not a curable disease, but with your veterinarian's guidance it is possible to manage the condition and provide your cat with a good quality of life.

## **Symptoms of Cat Diabetes**

Early detection and treatment of diabetes in cats is important. Here are the most common clinical signs and symptoms pet owners need to look out for:

### Excessive Urination and Drinking

Cats with diabetes have high levels of glucose in their blood to contend with, they are unable to drive the glucose into the cells so the body flushes it out in the urine. However, the body needs to use extra fluids to accomplish this task, leading to large volumes of urine (polyuria) and increased thirst and drinking (polydipsia) to compensate for the losses.

### Unexplained Weight Loss

Cats with diabetes may lose weight despite a hearty appetite. Remember the diabetic body is unable to use energy from food and must turn to other sources such as stored fats and proteins leading to weight loss, including loss of muscle mass.

### Other Signs

Cats with diabetes may also display signs such as an unkempt coat, inappropriate urination, weakness, and a plantigrade stance (walking with the hocks touching the ground)

## ‍**Is Your Cat at Risk?**

As with any disease, there are some cats that are at a higher risk of developing diabetes. Factors contributing to an elevated risk include obesity, a sedentary lifestyle, middle to advanced age, being male, and the long-term use of steroid medications (such as may be used for the control of asthma or other conditions).

Some of these factors are completely out of our control, however obesity is a major contributing factor with obese cats being up to **four times more likely** to develop diabetes than their average-weight counterparts. This means by maintaining a healthy weight for our feline friends, we can significantly decrease their risk of developing diabetes.

If you're concerned about your cat's risk of developing diabetes or seeking guidance for how to manage their weight through a healthy diet and exercise, **contact your veterinarian**. They can provide valuable guidance on how to manage these risk factors and help your cat lead a healthier life.

## **When to See a Vet**

In addition to seeking veterinary care for preventative advice, recognizing the signs of diabetes in cats can significantly help in knowing when to seek veterinary support for a possible diabetes diagnosis. As discussed above, the most common signs of diabetes in a cat include **excessive thirst, excessive urination** , and **weight loss** despite a healthy or increased appetite.

While these signs are not exclusive to diabetes, they are indicative of an underlying condition and warrant a veterinary exam to discover the cause. Remember, early detection can drastically improve your pet's chances of managing diabetes, and other diseases, and maintaining quality of life.

## **Diagnosis Process**

### Importance of Veterinarian Check-ups

Regular veterinarian check-ups are essential in the early detection and management of diabetes in cats. These visits allow veterinarians to conduct in-depth assessments, including monitoring your cat's weight, checking for signs that indicate health issues, and performing blood and urine tests that can detect diabetes. Identifying diabetes early is vital as it can lead to a more effective treatment plan and a better prognosis for your beloved pet. Furthermore, veterinarians play an integral role in managing the condition by providing ongoing support, nutritional guidance, and advice on insulin therapy if required.

Your veterinarian will typically begin the diagnostic process by conducting a thorough **physical examination** and asking your cat's **medical history**. This involves understanding the symptoms your cat has been showing, including any progression of signs and the time scale over which they have occurred. It's also important to discuss your cat's lifestyle, diet, and any recent changes in their behavior or environment. Next, the vet will perform **screening laboratory tests** , primarily examining the levels of glucose in the cat's blood and urine. 

Other tests can also be useful to rule out similar conditions, complications due to diabetes, or comorbidities (separate diseases present at the same time). Such tests may include a urine culture to check for urinary tract infections; fructosamine test which helps estimate blood glucose values over the recent past; or additional screening blood chemistry tests to assess major organ function.

### Understanding Test Results

Making sense of your cat's test results can seem overwhelming, but understanding them can assist you in taking an active role in your cat's health. Three primary results point to a diabetes diagnosis: sustained elevated glucose levels in the blood (**hyperglycemia**), the presence of glucose in the urine (**glucosuria**), and the presence of ketones in the cat's urine (**ketonuria**). 

We’ve discussed how the diabetic cat comes to be persistently hyperglycemic (glucose can’t get into the cells) as well as why they exhibit glucosuria (glucose is flushed out into the urine). The third marker, ketonuria, occurs when the glucose starved cells break down the body's protein to use as an energy source. Ketones are a byproduct of protein metabolism and are excreted in the urine. 

When this occurs the cat is in or reaching a dangerous state known as diabetic ketoacidosis, which we will discuss later on under _coping with complications_. Ketonuria doesn't only occur with uncontrolled diabetes, there are other serious conditions that can lead to ketones in the urine including [pancreatitis](https://www.codapet.com/senior-pet-care/introduction-to-pancreatitis-in-cats), hepatic lipidosis, and some forms of cancer. Your veterinarian will gather and interpret all the information, clarifying what it means for your pet's condition, and how it affects the treatment strategy moving forward.

### How Serious is Cat Diabetes?

When a cat is diagnosed with diabetes, it's natural for pet owners to question the severity of the condition. Diabetes in cats is indeed serious, but it's also manageable with vigilant care. One of the potential complications of uncontrolled diabetes is diabetic neuropathy, which affects the nerves in the hind legs, possibly causing weakness or an abnormal gait. Fortunately, this particular issue is reversible with proper treatment and does not typically cause pain.

More concerning is diabetic ketoacidosis, a critical condition that arises when a cat's cells, deprived of glucose, start to metabolize fat instead, leading to a dangerous increase in blood acidity. This condition is a true medical emergency and requires prompt veterinary care to treat.

The long-term impacts of diabetes on a cat's health can be mitigated through early detection and intervention. The quicker diabetes is diagnosed and treated, the better the chances are for maintaining your cat's quality of life. An effective management plan includes regular blood sugar monitoring, dietary adjustments tailored to your cat's needs, and possibly insulin therapy.

For pet owners navigating a diabetes diagnosis, support is crucial. We offer resources and guidance to help you understand and manage your cat’s condition, ensuring you are not alone in this journey.

### Important Follow-ups

Post-diagnosis, regular follow-ups with your veterinarian are essential for managing diabetes in cats. Your veterinarian may recommend additional tests like a blood glucose curve or fructosamine concentration test monitor **how well your cat's diabetes is being controlled** over time. 

**Glucose curves** watch the glucose levels throughout the day while **fructosamine** tests provide a snapshot of your cat's average blood glucose levels over the past 2-3 weeks, providing valuable insight into the effectiveness of your cat's treatment plan. Regular follow-up appointments also allow your veterinarian to adjust treatment protocols as necessary, address any concerns you may have, and monitor your pet's overall health.

## **Managing Cat Diabetes**

### Medications and Insulin Therapy

One of the cornerstones of managing feline diabetes is insulin therapy. Insulin therapy involves the administration of insulin to help regulate the cat's blood sugar levels. There are multiple types of insulin preparations that can be used in the treatment of diabetes in cats, such as lente insulin (Vetsulin), ProZinc, and glargine insulin. These types of insulin vary in cost, duration of action, and concentration, so it's vital for pet owners to discuss the pros and cons of each type with their veterinarian when deciding which insulin is best for their cat. Insulin injections are typically given under the skin approximately every 12 hours. While the prospect of giving injections may seem daunting, most owners can be taught to administer these injections at home quite easily. We understand the challenges of managing a pet's chronic illness and are here to provide guidance and support throughout this journey.

### Dietary Management and Exercise

In addition to medication, dietary management and regular exercise play a significant role in managing diabetes in cats. A diet low in carbohydrates such as a canned food diet or prescription diet specifically for diabetic cats has been shown to improve blood sugar regulation. There are several prescription food options available in both wet and dry food forms, and a veterinarian can provide guidance on the best dietary choices for each individual cat. For cats who are overweight when diagnosed with diabetes, slow, controlled weight loss under the close monitoring of a veterinarian is essential to achieve better control over blood glucose levels. Regular exercise can also help manage your cat's weight and improve overall health.

### Monitoring Blood Sugar Levels

Though ideal, regular daily blood sugar monitoring is not practical in cats and thus blood glucose curves may be recommended instead as a valuable tool in this monitoring process. They involve allowing your cat to remain under clinic care for at least 8 hours for blood sugar monitoring. The cat’s blood sugar level would be tested just before an insulin injection and then periodically at a frequency of every 1-4 hours throughout the day depending on how low or high the sugar levels are trending. This testing helps to ensure that the cat's blood glucose levels stay within a safe range and identifies any critical drops that could indicate a risk for hypoglycemia—a dangerous condition for diabetic cats. The results of a blood glucose curve can inform your veterinary team about whether insulin levels need to be adjusted or not.

Beyond glucose curves, it's also important to keep track of your cat's weight, water intake, and appetite. Observing changes in these indicators can reveal how well the diabetes management plan is working. Such regular health monitoring can help prevent complications arising from uncontrolled diabetes, such as neuropathy or ketoacidosis.

To help reduce stress for your cat and obtain more accurate glucose readings, many cat owners gradually learn to conduct these tests at home. This avoids the stress-induced hyperglycemia that cats often experience during veterinary visits.

### Potential Complications and How to Handle Them

While managing diabetes in cats can be challenging, it's important to be aware of the potential complications and how to handle them. One such complication is hypoglycemia, where blood glucose levels become dangerously low. Signs of hypoglycemia include weakness, lethargy, vomiting, lack of coordination, seizures, and in severe cases, coma. Hypoglycemia can be life-threatening if left untreated, so any diabetic cat displaying these signs should be offered its regular food immediately. If the cat does not eat voluntarily, it should be given oral glucose in the form of honey or corn syrup rubbed onto its gums and brought to a veterinarian immediately.

Another potential complication is ketoacidosis, a condition that occurs when cells starved for glucose begin to break down fats for energy, leading to an increased acidity in the blood. This is a medical emergency and requires immediate veterinary attention. We're here to provide guidance and support to help pet owners navigate these challenges and ensure their pets receive the best care possible.

## **How to Administer Insulin to Your Cat**

Administering insulin to your cat may feel a bit daunting at first, but with a bit of practice, you and your cat will adjust to the routine. Here is a basic step-by-step guide so you know what to expect:

  1. Feed your cat according to the schedule determined by your vet to ensure they will have glucose available in their bloodstream and avoid hypoglycemia. Commonly, feeding is recommended to be done prior to injecting the insulin but your vet may have special instructions based on your cat’s history and the type and dose of insulin being used.
  2. Draw up the correct insulin dosage into the syringe. It's important that there are no air bubbles in the syringe to ensure an accurate dose is given (injecting a small air bubble under your cat's skin will _not_ lead to a life threatening embolism like it can when injected into a vein).
  3. The next step involves finding the right spot for the injection. Often, the best place to inject insulin is into the loose skin between your cat's shoulder blades.
  4. As you get ready to give the injection, try to make the process as calming as possible. Speak to your cat soothingly and pet them gently; try to control your own nerves.
  5. Pick up a fold of your cat's skin using your thumb and forefinger of your nondominant hand and quickly insert the needle with the other hand. Push the syringe's plunger to release the insulin, and then remove the needle.
  6. Safely discard the needle according to your vet’s instructions.



Your veterinarian or veterinary nurse will guide you through this process before sending you home with the prescribed insulin. If you ever have any questions be sure to reach out for assistance.

## **Feline Diabetes Monitoring- Checking Glucose At Home**

As discussed above, your cat's insulin needs may change over time. Determining their blood glucose level is helpful in monitoring for needed adjustments to insulin therapy. If you are able to test your cat’s blood glucose at home it can give **more accurate** results than testing in a clinic situation after the stress of travel. To do this you’ll need a **glucose meter** and test strips and most importantly directions on how to safely get a small blood sample. Speak with your cat’s vet if this is something you are interested in learning to do. It may take time to get used to this process, but it will become **easier with practice**.

## **Living with A Diabetic Cat**

### Daily Routine Adjustment

We’ve discussed the importance of establishing a new normal **routine** of diet and exercise, and insulin injections when prescribed. Consistently carrying out these activities at the **same time** each day will help orchestrate your cat’s glucose levels, avoiding high peaks or low valleys throughout the day.

### Monitoring your Cat's Health

Early detection of irregularities can be crucial in managing diabetes in cats. Diabetic patients have an **increased risk** of other conditions such as urinary tract infection, skin infections, [kidney disease](https://www.codapet.com/how-will-i-know-when-its-time/most-common-terminal-cat-diseases), liver disease, and cataracts. In addition to causing discomfort and disease, these other conditions can throw your cat’s glucose needs out of alignment causing insulin treatments to be ineffective or potentially dangerous. 

Observe your pet for any changes in behavior or physical condition. Simple things, such as noting changes in drinking, eating, and urination habits, can be vital clues for your vet to investigate.

### Coping with Complications

Sometimes, diabetic cats might suffer from complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia.

**Diabetic ketoacidosis** (DKA) is an **emergency** condition resulting from uncontrolled diabetes. It is characterized by signs like not eating, vomiting, diarrhea, progressive weakness, and even depression or coma. DKA occurs when a diabetic cat’s glucose-starved cells use alternate sources of energy such as the body’s stored proteins and fats for an extended period of time. 

This protein and fat catabolism makes ketones as a byproduct. As mentioned above, some of the ketones leave the body via the urine, but this is an unsustainable solution. As the ketones build up in the cat’s blood they lower the pH making it more acidic and requiring intensive veterinary care to correct.

**Hypoglycemia** is another **emergency** problem which lies at the other end of the diabetic spectrum. Hypoglycemia occurs when there is not enough glucose in the bloodstream. It is characterized by signs such as lethargy, disorientation, weakness, tremors, seizures, and vomiting. Applying honey or dextrose gel to the cat’s gums and immediately contacting the veterinarian are potentially life-saving measures for a hypoglycemic cat. Once your cat is stabilized your veterinarian will investigate the cause for the hypoglycemic event and adjust the insulin dose as needed.

### Dealing with Emergencies

As a pet owner, being prepared to handle emergencies is crucial, especially when living with a diabetic cat. Diabetic emergencies can include episodes of hypoglycemia, where blood glucose levels drop dangerously low. Signs of hypoglycemia include weakness, lethargy, vomiting, lack of coordination, and in severe cases, seizures or coma. If your cat shows any of these signs, offer them their regular food immediately. If they do not eat voluntarily, give them oral glucose in the form of honey or corn syrup onto their gums and seek immediate veterinary attention. It's important to remember not to try to force fingers, food, or fluids into the mouth of a convulsing or comatose cat. We're here to provide guidance and support to help you navigate these challenging situations.

### Long-term Care and Prognosis

Managing diabetes in a cat can be a lifelong commitment, but with the right care and treatment, your cat can continue to enjoy a good quality of life. Long-term care for a diabetic cat includes regular monitoring of blood glucose levels, dietary management, regular exercise, and in most cases, daily insulin injections. It's important to note that with early diagnosis and aggressive treatment, many cats will enter a state of diabetic remission, where they are able to maintain normal blood sugar levels without insulin injections. Older cats, cats who have previously received steroid medications, and cats treated with glargine insulin are more likely to go into diabetic remission. However, even if a cat has achieved diabetic remission, they should continue to be fed a low-carbohydrate diet and receive close monitoring, as some may eventually require insulin therapy again.

### Emotional Support for Your Cat

Cats, like humans, can sense and respond to stress and emotional changes in their environment. Therefore, providing emotional support for your diabetic cat is an important aspect of their care. This can include spending quality time with your cat, providing a calm, stress-free and stable environment, and maintaining a regular routine. A calm and soothing demeanor can help your cat feel safe and secure, especially during potentially stressful situations such as insulin injections or blood glucose monitoring. Emotional support can also enhance your bond with your cat and improve their overall wellbeing. We understand the emotional challenges that can come with managing a chronic illness like diabetes in pets, and we're here to provide guidance and resources to help you and your pet navigate this journey together.

## **Preventing Cat Diabetes**

Living with a cat with diabetes can be a significant source of worry for pet parents. The good news is, it isn't entirely out of your control. Here, we outline some preventive measures you can take, highlighting **healthy lifestyle tips** , **risk factors to avoid** , the importance of **regular health checks** , and the **benefits of early detection**.

### Healthy Lifestyle Tips

Achieving and maintaining your pet’s ideal weight is a key starting point for preventing diabetes in cats. **Obesity significantly increases a cat's likelihood of developing diabetes.**

  * Encourage regular physical activity. It can be especially difficult for indoor cats to remain active (although there are decreases in other [risk factors](https://www.codapet.com/how-will-i-know-when-its-time/when-to-euthanize-a-cat-with-end-stage-lymphoma) for indoor cats). Regular playing sessions and stimulation can help keep their weight in check.
  * Consider a diet that's low in carbs but high in protein. Balanced nutrition is vital for cats at every life stage. Wet food may be preferable to dry food for its role in promoting [urinary tract health](https://www.codapet.com/senior-pet-care/understanding-feline-lower-urinary-tract-disease-flutd) and [kidney health](https://www.codapet.com/senior-pet-care/understanding-kidney-failure-in-cats-a-comprehensive-guide).
  * As a rule of thumb, monitor your cat’s feeding habits. Don’t leave food out all day for your cat to graze on rather, feed measured portions.



Remember, **every cat has different dietary requirements.** Feel free to consult your vet or a feline nutrition expert to ensure your cat is getting the diet they need.

### Regular Health Checks

Having your cat examined by a vet can help **detect any early signs** of diabetes. Regular health checks are essential to maintaining overall health and spotting any potential issues early. If your cat is **at risk** of developing diabetes (due to factors like obesity or advancing age), your vet may suggest spot glucose testing during your cat’s regular check-ups.

### Benefits of Early Detection

We cannot emphasize enough the **importance of early detection** in managing diabetes. The earlier the disease is diagnosed, the better the chance your beloved pet has of **avoiding comorbidities** and leading an active, healthy, and happy life. Early detection can prevent more severe symptoms from developing, and gives more treatment options. Remember, careful monitoring and regular vet check-ups are essential.

## **Coping with a Diabetes Diagnosis**

Hearing the diagnosis of diabetes for your beloved cat can be a shock. We understand that it can be overwhelming to see your feline friend struggle with a serious and incurable illness like diabetes. But remember that you're not alone in this journey. There are numerous cat owners who have traveled this path and successfully managed diabetic cats.

When you first learn about your cat's condition, you may feel a whirl of emotions. It's normal to feel apprehensive and worried. You'll have more responsibilities now, including keeping a regular schedule that revolves around your cat’s mealtimes. Figuring out the best routine for your cat can feel like an unending process of trial and error. But **don’t lose hope**. Cats who suffer from diabetes can lead long and happy lives with care and management of the disease. Some cats will even **achieve remission** , where insulin injections are no longer needed to manage blood glucose levels.

If you’re struggling with the changes this diagnosis has brought to your home, try **connecting with others** who also have a diabetic kitty. Online forums, social media groups and local pet communities can be great places to meet other cat owners dealing with feline diabetes. Sharing experiences and coping strategies can make the journey easier and less isolating.

Understanding and managing cat diabetes can seem daunting, but remember, **you're not alone**. We hope this comprehensive guide has equipped you with the knowledge you need to move ahead and work with your vet to manage the condition effectively, ensuring your cat continues living a happy, healthy life.
