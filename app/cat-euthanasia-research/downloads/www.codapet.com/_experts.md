> Faced the difficult decision to euthanize our beloved 18 year old Papillon and used Codapet to do it in our home as our dog hated to go to the vet. Dr. Katie Todd arrived and explained in detail the process, gave us plenty of time to say our goodbyes, and made the process as easy as possible. She was very reassuring to my children that we had made the right decision and explained all the options for taking care of the remains and provided us with keepsakes to ease the family’s pain. Thank you so much Dr.Todd in doing what has to be one of the world’s toughest jobs!

> Saying goodbye to our beloved dachshund Lily was one of the most painful moments of our lives, but thanks to Dr. Lisa Stadler with CodaPet, it was also one of the most peaceful and compassionate. Dr. Lisa, a retired veterinarian, brought a gentle presence and deep empathy into our home—qualities that made an unbearable day a little more bearable. Her kindness and professionalism helped guide my wife and me through the process with grace and dignity. We are overwhelmingly grateful that Lily was able to pass in the comfort of her home, surrounded by the space and the things she loved most. Holding her in my arms as she went peacefully was a blessing I will never forget. The communication with CodaPet was seamless, and scheduling the appointment was simple—something I deeply appreciated during such an emotionally difficult time. I cannot recommend CodaPet and Dr. Lisa more highly. Their service was not just professional—it was personal, compassionate, and deeply respectful. Thank you for being part of Lily’s journey, and ours. You will forever hold a place in our hearts.

> I’m truly grateful for CodaPet’s service in helping us schedule a qualified veterinarian on the same day. After assessing my cat’s quickly declining quality of life, being able to arrange a timely appointment was a bittersweet relief that ensured we didn’t prolong his suffering. Dr. April Le Blanc arrived on time and immediately put us at ease. She took the time to understand our cat’s condition, introduced herself to him gently, and answered all our questions with compassion. With over 30 years of veterinary experience—and as a parent to many of her own pets—her empathy and expertise were evident in every step of the process. Although saying goodbye to my dear cat was heart-wrenching, I’m grateful that his passing was peaceful and that I could be right beside him, doing everything I could to keep him at ease. Having the service done at home allowed our other cat to be present, which we hope helps her understand his passing. Dr. Le Blanc gave us all the time we needed afterward and offered heartfelt comfort during an incredibly difficult moment. I’m deeply thankful for her kindness and professionalism. I highly recommend Dr. April Le Blanc and CodaPet for anyone needing compassionate end of life care for their pet. She also followed up with grief-support resources, which I truly appreciate.

So when he showed signs of his time being up, I knew from a friend -in home pet euthanasia- was a peaceful goodbye. Dr. John Murray was beyond thoughtful and professional with amazing bedside manner. Mac had a wonderful last day at home and I held him in my arms as we said goodbye. It was beyond hard, but I also wouldn’t have it any other way looking back. Mac hated his car carrier, the car, a vet office is so cold. We were in our beautiful, sunny room, comfortable and well, I’d want to go the same way!

> This was our first experience with in-home euthanasia and would highly recommend it. Your fur baby is where they want to be and are surrounded with love and calm. Our Radley had gone down fast over the last month and we had an appt scheduled for a Friday morning. He woke up the Wednesday before, which happened to be New Year’s Eve, and couldn’t hardly walk. Seemed like a stroke or something of that nature. I sent a video to Dr. Mays and asked if there was any way she could come that day. She checked her schedule and worked with us so that our sweet boy didn’t have to suffer much longer. She came out early afternoon on New Year’s Eve and helped us ease our sweet Radley across the Rainbow Bridge. We are forever grateful for her professionalism, kindness and empathy.

> The form for the service was very easy to complete. I appreciated this since making this decision was very difficult and I was fraught with emotion. I wanted my beloved cat Buddy to have a pain free transition at our home. He was 18 years. His decline was rapid; he became extremely ill in the span of a week with advanced kidney disease. Dr. Lutri was so gentle and loving to Buddy. She explained every step of the process and asked me before each step if I was ready to move to the next. Dr. Lutri was gracious, kind, and compassionate. She has the most peaceful, calm, loving presence and a profound caring for the pets she serves and their pet guardians. She comforted me greatly as she took care of my magnificent boy. She genuinely understood the magical connection I had with Buddy and treated him so tenderly when she put his sweet body into a beautiful bed to transport him the the crematorium. I felt like Dr. Lutri was an angel sent to me in my dire time of need and loss. She was exceptional in every way. She is a talented doctor overflowing with empathy and understanding who is beautiful inside and out.

> We suddenly found ourselves in an unbearable situation with our 17-year-old dog, Teddy. His health declined so quickly, and we had to rush to find someone who could help us say goodbye at home. Thankfully, we were able to book an appointment with Dr. Lisa. She came to our house with such humility, patience, and compassion. She listened as we cried and asked a million questions, gently reassuring us that we were doing the right thing for our sweet boy. She never rushed us, she gave us the space and time we needed to say goodbye. As heartbreaking as it was, Teddy passed peacefully and comfortably in our arms. Dr. Lisa treated him with love, dignity, and respect, and made sure he was safely transported for cremation. She even followed up with us afterward to reassure us he had arrived where he needed to go. Losing Teddy has been one of the hardest things we’ve ever gone through, but we have no regrets choosing Dr. Lisa. She gave our boy the most loving, gentle passing we could have hoped for.

> We're so grateful for the experience we had with Dr. Thomas when we had to say goodbye to our senior cat, Maica. It was incredibly painful to see Maica suffering from rapidly increased symptoms of her advanced kidney disease, and we weren't expecting to have to say goodbye to her at the time we did. Dr. Thomas was deeply empathetic and kind with both us and Maica, and during our appointment she gave us plenty of information and time to process both the procedure and Maica's passing. It means the world that we could spend Maica's final moments with her, making sure she felt safe and loved until the end. I would recommend Dr. Thomas to anyone who unfortunately has to make this difficult decision, and even though we miss Maica deeply, it helps to know she was shepherded on with such care.

> I cannot express enough the gratitude I feel for Dr. Lisa Feig. It was heart wrenching knowing I had to say goodbye to my precious Dottie before she began to suffer. We loved her so much. With that said, Dr. Lisa Feig made the experience so much easier and peaceful for our sweet girl. I knew Dottie was not in pain and crossed over in the most peaceful way. Dr. Feig is the most compassionate, caring, thoughtful doctor anyone could ask for. Anyone who has Dr. Feig in their life as wife, mother, daughter, friend--is an extremely lucky person. She was so giving of her time and patience. I recommend at home euthanasia to everyone. Having your loved one home, comfortable in their surroundings is really the best option. I hated the idea of her being at a hospital or vet clinic in a sterile environment. I got to hold her and tell her how pretty she was and how loved she was. And all the while, Dr. Feig demonstrated such genuine compassion. My fiancé and I were blown away. It takes a special person to do this type of job. And Dr. Lisa Feig more than meets that requirement. A million thanks to her and Coda Pet.

> Dr. Vernon was absolutely amazing. She was caring, empathetic, and explained the entire process beforehand. She was so kind to my Nala and I want to thank her for that. This process was so difficult for me and Dr. Vernon was there the entire time to support me.

> Dr. Duvall did a fantastic job easing our dog out of this world, and in tending to our human needs and concerns as well. She really went the extra mile and was full of compassion for all of us. I can't imagine how the inherently difficult situation could have been made any easier.

> Dr. Bates was wonderful during her visit. She was caring, gentle, and reassuring throughout the whole process, easing our worries and explaining each step. I could tell just how much she cared, about us and our pet. She really made a very difficult time so much easier, and for that, I can't thank her enough.

> I can't say enough fabulous things about Dr. Jessica Pruitt! It was a hard decision (as it always will be) when its time for our "buddies" to have to leave us:( but Dr. Jessica is so gentle and kind. She explains everything, is very patient and my Molly just warmed right up to her which made things even easier. I can't express the gratitude to Dr. Jessica enough as she made this as peaceful as can be for all of us:) Thank you Dr. Jessica!

> Dr. Schmalz is calm and patient in all that she does. She's gentle and helps answer any questions every step of the way. My dog greeted her with curiosity and Dr. Schmalz just let Bella sniff and explore until she was comfortable. My dog selected her special place for her last moments, and Dr. Schmalz accommodated that without question. It was important to me that my other dog be present and that worked out well. We never felt rushed in any way.

> My best friend and constant companion had to cross the Rainbow Bridge. You never want that day to come, but when it does it is so nice to have Dr. Rob by your side. My Luna never takes to new people, or people other than me actually, but Dr. Rob made her comfortable before her journey. Made me comfortable, too. Not easy in either case! But, handled with ease by Dr. Rob. The journey itself was handled with great care and compassion. No pain. Just a gentle sleep and a final good bye. I could not ask for a better experience on such a day. Thank you, from both Luna and I, Dr, Rob.

> When our French bulldog Roxen was diagnosed with Stage 5 IVDD and could no longer walk with in a matter of two days and was in extreme pain even with the meds our vet had given us to the point where I could not even move him without him yelping in agony, we had to make the difficult decision to put him down in a short time frame. It was not an easy decision and was even harder being over the weekend with our normal vet not being very helpful to us in our opinion. So after doing research and looking around at places that could do it, my mom told me of a friend of hers that had gotten an in home euthanasia. At the time I had never heard of it and I had never had to be the one to put a family pet down, so I looked around at a couple of different places on the internet after a google search. Most websites made it more difficult to schedule a time for a vet to come and visit, but with codapet.com it was actually very user friendly. So on Sunday morning after having a rough night with our beloved roxen, I set the initial appointment up for the first available for my area which was on Tuesday. Within moments I received emails and texts confirming the appointment. Dr. Schmillen reached out to me after reading our story of what had been happening to our boy Roxen and said that she could come sooner if we needed. At the time we were still thinking about going to an emergency vet place we had never been where we were going to have to move Roxen who yelped in pain whenever I tried to move him, so when she said she could come sooner I asked if she could come the same day and she said yes. She came within a few hours and was very respectful and understanding about what was going on and explained the whole process to our family. Her coming to the house on such short notice really shows how much she cares for pets and their families that have to go through this difficult time. She helped make this hard decision for us a little easier and words cannot express how grateful we are for her and the service they provide. Being able to be in your home and having your beloved pet be surrounded by all of their loved ones including our other dog Jax was a blessing. The whole process took a couple of hours and it was much easier for him to be laid to rest in his favorite bed surrounded by us instead of being on a cold table in a strange place with only a few of us being with him. I will suggest this process to everyone I know and I will only do it this way if I ever have to do it again (although I am hoping I never have to again). Dr. Angela was very kind to the whole family and took her time. She helped us and our young daughter (12) understand everything that was going on and made the whole process a little easier. I cannot say enough how grateful we are for her and the service they provide.

> Dr. Dzierga was so kind and made one of the worst possible things you’ll ever have to do a little softer. We had to say goodbye to our almost 16 yo doxie mix, Stella, suffering from renal failure, right after the new year. Knowing how nervous she always was going to the vet, letting her pass in peace at home was very important to us. Dr. Briell took the time to speak with us, layout, exactly what would happen and this time allowed Stella to be at ease. Thankful that her heart led to her to help families in this situation.

> Dr Sarah was incredibly compassionate and tender with our 20+ year old cat, Meadow. This was our second time with at-home pet euthanasia. The experience was very peaceful for Meadow; she was home and on her favorite couch blanket in her final moments, surrounded by love and care. Dr Sarah took the time to ask about Meadow's story, how long we had her, and really connect with us before helping us say goodbye. We'll call CodaPet when our next senior is ready to cross the rainbow bridge.

> I was really struggling with the decision to put my kitty to sleep. I knew it was eminent because her health was declining, but the thought of someone taking my sweet girl away was agonizing. When the time came, Dr. Thomason put my mind at ease immediately. Her kindness was apparent right away and I completely trusted her to take good care of my sweet girl. She took great care of both of us. Thank you so much, Dr. Thomason!

> I am grateful to Dr. Stephanie Norman for coming to our home and making such a heart-wrenching process a little less stressful. I had my cat Noodles for 17 years. He was the center of my world and when his little body was riddled with Cancer I had to set him free. Dr. Stephanie Norman was kind an reassuring. She explained the whole process as she went. I highly recommend her if you need to say goodbye to your furry loved one.

> Dr. Anna was absolutely amazing in every single way! This was the first time I’d ever been in a position to choose when to say goodbye, and although it was by FAR the most difficult thing I’ve ever had to do in my whole entire life, Dr. Anna helped me tremendously and she made the whole process as peaceful and as simple as it could possibly be. No words could ever describe how deeply caring, thoughtful and understanding she was throughout the whole entire process. I cannot possibly thank her enough for making our sudden and heartbreaking goodbye as peaceful as one could ever hope for.

> Dr Mary was truly kind and compassionate during our appointment. We ended up having to schedule the visit sooner than we initially expected as our senior kitty got rapidly worse. Nothing about that day was easy, but everything was taken care of for us so we just got to be there for our companion. Dr Mary walked us through every step of the process, making sure we and our senior kitty were comfortable the whole time. I am so grateful we were able to say goodbye at home, where our kitty felt safe, and get those precious extra minutes with him.

> It's the service you never want but when it comes I was so thankful for Dr. Todd. She was so compassionate and patient with us. Our sweet cat was able to cross the rainbow bridge in the comfort of his home without the stress of being moved to a vets office in his final hours. She even brought his ashes back to us. I can't thank her enough for this. We also had to move his appointment up and she was quick to move to his needs. I hope I don't need their services for a long time for my other fur babies but I will use her again in the very, very distant future.

> Dr. Katie was amazing! She handled everything so professionally yet personally too. Ruger will be so missed by many (as she can attest to, she said it was the biggest crowd she'd had, there were 9 of us) and I will never take my pets to a cold impersonal clinic to pass if I can help it. Having your pet pass at home where they're comfortable and familiar was such a blessing!

> I can’t say enough good things about Dr Kristi Thompson’s kindness and compassion both before, during, and after this process. 10/10 would recommend. She thoroughly and professionally explained the process. She listened carefully to the long list of ailments our senior dog was experiencing. She then examined our dog and explained what was potentially treatable, and what the prognosis was. This allowed us the chance to make a fully informed decision before proceeding. I appreciated that, especially since it was a lethal one for a very loved family member. We never felt rushed or pressured one way or the other. I just wish there were people doctors who were as attentive, kind, compassionate, and laid out the various options to their patients.

> This was definitely the way to give your baby wings. My dog was very afraid of the vet office, and i did not want him to be on his last day on earth. Dr Anna was on time, very loving, caring and made us all feel at ease with going forward. She even brought a treat for him, and my very usually picky dog ate it! She was amazing, and I would definitely call on her again. Thank you, Dr Anna. The Hallfrisch's.

> We had to say goodbye to our pup Leo, who we had for 16 years, and it was one of the most painful things I ever had to do. Leo had advanced kidney disease and his health quickly deteriorated. We had scheduled a Coda Appointment with Dr. Derecka Alexander for a Tuesday, but Leo’s health took a turn for the worse on a Sunday. I emailed Coda Pet to ask if there was any possibility any Vet could come out sooner. Dr. Alexander immediately contacted me and made herself available in our time of need. We were so appreciative of Dr. Alexander’s compassion and kindness in helping our beloved pup Leo cross over the rainbow bridge, especially after it became urgent. She made a very difficult experience of us having to say goodbye to our pup more manageable. We chose to get a Vet to come to our home for our final goodbye to our Leo because we wanted him to be surrounded by the warmth of our love, the comfort of his family, and the smells and sounds he has always known. I wanted his last memories to be of us — his family — holding him, kissing him, thanking him. Thank you, Dr. Alexander, for allowing us to provide that to our pup Leo.

> When Dr Martin arrived, my little guy Barney ran to the door to greet him like he did all guests. He even barked at him, before jumping up to him to get attention. Dr Martin greeted him back, warmly and sincerely. He was playful with Barney while explaining the process to us. Lane made a horrible no win situation more acceptable with his calm demeanor and soothing words. I can't thank Dr Martin enough for helping little Barney come to peaceful end to his life's journey.

> Putting my beloved Avery down was the hardest day of my life. While there is no easy way to do that, Dr. Noe made the experience so much better. From the moment she came to my house, her calm presence put everyone at ease, including my dog. She was professional, yet spoke as if she had known Avery for years. She gave us as much time as we needed to say goodbye to our baby without feeling rushed. After Avery passed, Dr. Noe gave a heartfelt speech and hugged us all. I couldn't imagine having to euthanize in any other way.

> There are no words that fully capture the gratitude I feel for Dr. Daniela Lutri. During the most heartbreaking moment of my life, she showed up with an incredible amount of compassion, patience, and gentleness. She treated my sweet Harley with such dignity and respect, and she treated me with kindness when I was completely broken. Dr. Lutri took the time to explain everything, never rushed a single step, and made sure Harley was comfortable, peaceful, and surrounded by love. The calm presence she brought into my home made an unbearable situation feel just a little more humane and a little less terrifying. Saying goodbye to a soul dog is devastating, but knowing Harley passed quietly, pain-free, and in my arms is something I will forever be grateful for. Dr. Lutri gave us the gift of a peaceful goodbye, and that is something I will carry with me for the rest of my life. I cannot recommend her enough to anyone facing this impossible decision. She truly does this work from the heart.
