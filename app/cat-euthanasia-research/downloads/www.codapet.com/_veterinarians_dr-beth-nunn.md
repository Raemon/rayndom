Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I became a veterinarian because I loved the science. But even more importantly I wanted to help better connect animals with their pet parents. I think as a veterinarian my job is to apply my medical knowledge and experience to help people understand what their pet needs from them so that pet owners can make the best decisions about care for their furry family members. I want to do home euthanasia in order to honor the human animal bond and all that our pets bring to our lives. I truly believe that euthanasia is the last best gift we can offer suffering animals and I want to facilitate the most stress-free, compassionate and comfortable goodbye for both the animals and their families.

## What pet parents are saying

> Dr Beth Nunn at CodaPet assisted us with an in home pet euthanasia for my kitty Lulu. Taking her to a vet office again was not an option as she was stressed and terrified after going there. Plus vets want to continue to give meds and keep them in office, and I knew it was her time to pass. The process was very peaceful and Dr Nunn was so flexible given we had to change appts twice. Its the worse thing we have to do with our loving pets, but this made the process much less stressful.

> Dr. Beth was so kind and compassionate and really helped all of us as we were navigating Piper's last moments. She allowed us to be with her and comfort her and was so kind to our other pup who was with us saying goodbye to her best friend. I know that Dr. Beth helped Piper feel safe as she loved on us for the last time. Thank you Dr. Beth and thank you CodaPet.

> Dr. Nunn's professionalism and empathy during the very dark moments of saying good-bye to my cherished & much-loved cat provided comfort in a situation where there otherwise is no comfort. Her gentle & respectful treatment of my boy gave him a peaceful, loving exit nestled in my arms. She also sat with me for several minutes after he slipped away. I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Beth Nunn, whose presence provided strength when I desperately needed it.
