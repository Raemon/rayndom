Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

As my career has progressed, I have found helping pets transition out of this life to be the most meaningful and gratifying part of my job. The decision to say goodbye can be the most difficult and compassionate decision we make in the lives of our pets. Being able to do this in the comfort and warmth of one's own home can help ease this transition. I have been offering clients in-home euthanasia for years, and am grateful to extend this service to the community at large.

> Kristin Kemper was Ollie's vet for so many years and a big reason why he lived a healthy youthful long life! He always felt very at ease in her care. Having Kristin preside over Ollie's passing was a huge gift to him and to our family. It gave us a lot of peace saying goodbye to our Ollieboy at home in his favorite place, surrounded by his favorite people. He left so gently. We so appreciate Kristin's gentle and compassionate spirit, and of course the excellent care she gave Ollie throughout his long life. 💙

> Dr. Kristin was so kind and passionate with Titan and my family. It was such a hard decision to let our beloved family member Titan go, but Dr. Kristin made sure we knew it was the best decision we could make so Titan was not suffering any longer. He lived a long life, almost 14 years for a 100 pound lab/terrier mix. I don’t think I could’ve made a better decision then calling Dr. Kristin.

> It's such a hard and difficult decision to make, but I am so thankful that there are people who are willing to do this service. Our 13.5-year-old dog Layla was at the end of her battle with cancer and let us know it was time. After booking our appointment, she was having a rough night, and I was easily able to contact Dr. Kemper and change the time from the afternoon to the morning. She was very compassionate, explained all the steps and answered any questions. Layla passed very peacefully, and our cats were able to say goodbye as well.

> Dr Kemper and all of the other exceptional veterinarians at Animal Hospital of Factoria were so instrumental in our 14+ year old wheaten terrier's long and healthy and youthful life! From 8 weeks until we said goodbye to him at 739 (!) weeks, he received excellent, thorough, loving and compassionate care from Dr Kemper and her colleagues. We will always sing the praises of AHOF and recommend them so very highly for the care of your beloved pet.

> Dr. Kemper was so kind, compassionate and gentle as we said goodbye to our Cookie. She explained the process completely and reassured us our pup was comfortable and pain free throughout. Cookie was able to peacefully cross over in her favorite spot in the front yard and we avoided the fear and trauma she would have experienced from a last trip to the vet. I can't speak highly enough of in-home euthanasia and Dr. Kemper specifically. I'll definitely choose this again the next time we have to say goodbye to a fur-baby.

> On Sunday we made the appointment for Friday. Monday/Tuesday we noticed Tinkerbelle's condition seemed to be declining and asked Dr. Kemper if she could come sooner. She found (made) time on Wednesday for an earlier appointment and we really appreciated that. We liked her friendly professional approach, explaining the process and options in the details of how and where to perform the euthanasia. We think she carefully relieved any pain that Tinkerbelle had and gently put her to sleep. We liked that she wrapped Tinkerbelle up in a basket with her head exposed for final viewing and goodbye. Seem that our other cat misses Tinkerbelle too. Thank you.

> Dr. Kemper was wonderful. She was calm, loving, understanding and provided reassurance when we had to put our 18 year old cat down. It was myself, husband and two teen kids and after she confirmed Bella was gone, she quietly said goodbye and let herself out as we were all sobbing over Bella. I really appreciated her demeanor and compassion.

> Letting a beloved pet go is always a tough decision and one that isn't made lightly. I had scheduled an appointment with Dr. Kemper for late Thursday afternoon. That morning, my dog went out to go potty, came in, laid down and never got up. He told me it was his time and I was thankful a vet was scheduled for that afternoon. Dr. Kemper was kind gracious and understanding. I had never done an in home euthanasia before but I am so thankful I did. My dog had a very peaceful passing in the comfort of his own home with me close to him. There was no fear or trepidation on his part. I highly recommend Dr. Kemper if there is a need.

> Dr. Kemper was my dog's vet for about a year, and I feel that she actually knew my dog and treated him with the upmost care and concern. At almost 14 years old, and after having my pup with me for 11-1/2 years, he started to show signs of aging, and developed symptoms which indicated something more than age. Dr. Kemper spent all the time I needed with her to find out what was wrong. When it became evident that my boy was suffering, we decided that we didn't want him to suffer any more. She helped me to peacefully and painlessly let him go, and I will always be grateful to her for her knowledge and compassion.

> Jessica, with CodaPet, and Kristin, the vet, were both always emotionally supportive as we journeyed through our 4-footed family member's final uncertain days. When multiple cancer tumors are ravaging your pet's body, it's hard to know the best time to say goodbye, not wanting him to suffer yet allowing for as many of the remaining good days as possible. The right choice doesn't always feel good, but Kristin and Jessica helped make the transition as compassionate as possible. Forever thank you.

> I was and still am highly impressed with the kind, compassionate manner Dr. Kemper approached my dog and myself. She softly gained my dog, Luna's trust, and eased her into a peaceful sleep. In the three weeks after our encounter, when I think about it I feel that Dr. Kemper's supportive, thoughtful manner helped make the sad event seem reverent and meaningful.

> We thank Dr Kemper from our hearts for coming to our house to release Pantera from end stage kidney disease. She was so compassionate and caring, told us exactly what to expect from each step. The procedure was fast and Pantera did not feel any pain. We still are in mourning, BUT we know we did the right thing for our sweet lil kitty and companion of 20 years. Thank you, Dr Kemper. You are a bright Light.

> Dr. Kemper is truly the most kind and compassionate Veterinarian I have ever met. She came to our home, met our beloved pet, helped us grieve, and provided our 22 year old kitty the most peaceful transition possible. It takes an incredible soul to do the work they do. And we are forever grateful. I couldn’t have asked for a better experience for a member of our family. She went above and beyond. Thank you Dr. Kemper, and please keep helping other families and their beloved pets as long as you can.
