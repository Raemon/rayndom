Dr. Sara recently helped us say goodbye to our sweet girl cat. It was such a hard time for us and she was very mindful of that. We are grateful to have done this at home and the service she provides is beyond appreciated. The compassion and empathy she shows means a lot. The Cremation company used was great and respectful. Chloe was home within 8 days. We highly recommend this company and Dr.Sara.

Dr. Simpson was so wonderful when I needed to put my dog down. She didn't rush me, she reassured me about the decision and gave me time alone once he passed. She was so gentle and caring with him, but also with me. I could not have had a better experience than being at home where he is comfortable, and with Dr. Katie there to support.

## Pet euthanasia and cremation pricing in Denver, CO

### Reservations and payments

### Cancellation policy or pet passing

We charge cancellation fee of $100 if an appointment is cancelled less than 4 hours before the start time. If your pet passes away before your appointment you would not be charged a cancellation fee. If the vet you scheduled is able, and you would like their assistance with cremation, then pickup fee would apply instead of euthanasia fee

[Personalize Quote](/schedule-appointment "Personalize Quote")

## Other Consideration

### Large Animals

If you have a larger pet, your vet may need the help of one friend or family member. Talk to your vet about options and limitations when they reach out to you prior to your appointment, and they will inform you of any extra cost for your situation. 

### How do I get my pet’s ashes

Options for your pets return home and memorabilia depend on your local provider. Your vet coordinate the return of your pet’s ashes and let you know if there are additional fees for urn delivery. 

### Special factors affecting price

Extra time or medications needed can affect the total price. Other factors can be if it is decided that it’s not time to euthanize your pet after the vet has arrive. In that case, only the travel fee, platform fee, and a quality of life consult would apply. 

## FAQs

### What’s included in the total cost?

The total cost includes the in-home pet euthanasia service fee, any travel fee (if any apply), and a platform fee. Additionally, depending on your choice, fees may apply for cremation services or keepsakes.

### Will the vet take my pet with them after the appointment?

During your appointment, your vet will confirm your aftercare selection with you. If you choose to arrange cremation services, your vet will oversee your pet’s transportation to a local facility for cremation. If your preferred cremation option includes the return of your pet’s ashes to you, your vet will discuss the process to reunite you with your pet's ashes and the anticipated time frame during your appointment

### Will the vet examine my pet once they get to my home?

Yes, upon arrival the veterinarian will assess your pet. This can look different than an “nose to tail” examination in a clinic setting and will focus more on the pet’s history and quality of life.

### What if I am not sure it is time?

It is not uncommon to have doubts about whether the time is right. If you’ve taken the Quality of Life Questionnaire and are still unsure, we recommend consulting with your family veterinarian before scheduling an appointment.  
  
Rest assured, if you book an appointment, your in-home euthanasia veterinarian will let you know if they do not believe that euthanasia is appropriate at this time.

### How long will the procedure take?

You can expect your veterinarian to be in your home from 20-60 minutes, depending on how much of that time you need or want throughout the process.

### What is at home pet euthanasia, and how does it work?

At home pet euthanasia allows your pet to pass away peacefully in the comfort of your home surrounded by love. A compassionate veterinarian will provide end-of-life care for your pet starting with an initial end-of-life exam followed by sedation to ensure your pet is comfortable. Your vet will always move at your pace so you have the time you need to say your goodbyes. Once you are ready, your vet will administer medication to help them gently and painlessly say goodbye surrounded by comfort and love.

### How do I tell if my pet is suffering?

Our pets cannot directly communicate their feelings, but there are certain signs that may indicate they are in pain or are suffering. These include:  


  * **Behavioral changes** : Sometimes pain and suffering can be seen as increased aggression, a tendency to withdraw, or a loss in interest in the activities that they usually love. Shaking or trembling may also be indicative of pain or discomfort in your pet, especially if this is notably a new or unusual behavior for them.
  * **Changes in breathing** : Labored breathing, coughing, wheezing, or difficulty breathing are signs of potential distress and indicate that your pet needs to be evaluated immediately.
  * **Changes in appetite or weight loss** : Your pet may stop eating, may have a change in their food preferences or may demonstrate rapid weight loss.
  * **Lethargy** : If you notice that your pet is sleeping more, or seems to have a marked reduction in energy or a lack of willingness to get up, this may be indicative of pain or suffering.
  * **Anxiety or restlessness** : If your pet has difficulty settling, appears anxious, or cannot seem to sleep at night, this may indicate pain or suffering.
  * **Vocalizations** : If your pet is crying or vocalizing, it may indicate that your pet is in pain.



Animals instinctively hide pain as a survival mechanism, so it is important to be aware of these signs. If you have questions if your pet is experiencing pain or discomfort, please do not ever hesitate to reach out to a veterinarian.

### What should I do if my pet is declining fast?

If your pet's health is declining rapidly, it’s crucial to take the following steps:

  * **Consult Your Veterinarian** : Schedule an appointment to discuss your observations and any scoring from a quality-of-life scale. This information can help guide the conversation about your pet's condition and options moving forward. Your vet may suggest palliative care, hospice, or, if necessary, euthanasia.  

  * **Ensure Comfort** : Create a quiet, cozy space with soft bedding and easy access to food, water, and a litter box (if applicable).  

  * **Minimize Stress** : Keep routines simple and familiar, and limit loud noises or disruptions.  

  * **Offer Gentle Care** : Provide soothing touch through gentle petting and offer favorite treats if they can still eat.  

  * **Consider At-Home Euthanasia** : If appropriate, discuss the option of at-home euthanasia with your vet for a peaceful and familiar passing.  

  * **Reach Out for Support** : It's okay to lean on loved ones, pet-loss support groups, or counselors to help navigate this difficult time.



If you're noticing signs of declining health, we encourage you to use our [quality of life scale resource tool](https://www.codapet.com/quality-of-life-scale) to evaluate your pet's condition before your vet visit.

### How do I know when it’s time to consider euthanasia for my pet?

The journey for every pet is unique and different but we all understand the desire to keep our beloved friends with us as long as we can. We know that the decision for euthanasia is one of the most challenging decisions we will ever have to make. While our pets cannot talk to us, we know that there are certain things in life that bring them great joy and when they can no longer experience these things, or no longer want to, then it may be one way they are trying to communicate to us that it is time. At home, you may notice that they no longer enjoy experiences that they once loved (i.e. going for a car ride), they do not respond to you in the same way that they once did, and the bad days outnumber the good days. As the primary caregiver and family member, you know your pet best and have the best insight into their quality of life.

### What is the difference between in home pet euthanasia and euthanasia at a vet clinic?

The key difference is the setting. In home euthanasia allows your pet to pass peacefully in the comfort of their familiar surroundings, reducing stress and anxiety. This option especially benefits pets who may feel scared or uncomfortable traveling to a clinic. It also offers your family a private, intimate experience during this emotional time. While some urgent situations don’t allow for time to schedule in-home euthanasia, many pet owners in Denver choose in-home services for the peaceful atmosphere and compassionate care their pets receive right where they feel safest. You can [find flexible availability](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment) for our local vets here, or look for [same-day euthanasia](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request) appointments.

### Will my pet experience any pain during euthanasia?

After an initial end-of-life assessment, your veterinarian will first administer a sedative to ensure your pet is relaxed and comfortable. Your pet may have some brief discomfort with their first sedative injection, similar to receiving a vaccine. Your veterinarian will tailor their approach to your pet and the sedative injection based on your pet’s particular sensitivities or known pain points. The sedative will gently guide your pet into a deep sleep, preventing any further sensation. The euthanasia medication then gently stops the heart without causing pain. The process is peaceful and allows your pet to pass without distress.

### Is there an available vet service provider for in home pet euthanasia near me?

We have [a network of compassionate veterinarians](https://www.codapet.com/cities) serving many cities across the US who provide pet euthanasia at home for your beloved dog, cat, or other pets.

### Is there an additional fee for after-hours or emergency services?

### How much does at home pet euthanasia cost in my area?

The cost of at home pet euthanasia can vary in Denver and the surrounding areas. Once you have picked your provider, the cost will usuallydepend on your pet’s size and any additional services you may choose, such as cremation, keepsakes, or other services. Our services start with a base fee of $275 for in home euthanasia. If your vet is traveling further than their local area, there is a travel fee applied based on how far you are from them. At CodaPet, we believe in giving you complete transparency and control over what you are choosing for your pet’s end-of-life care. This is why you can view a detailed price estimate before you complete reserving a time with your local vet.

If you have any further questions, you can view our [FAQs](https://www.codapet.com/faqs) or reach us at **(833) 263 - 2738.**

###  Is the cost of euthanasia for dogs and cats the same?

Most providers in Denver charge a flat fee for euthanasia, although some providers do charge based on the size of your pet, so small dogs and cats can be the same price; however, medium or large size dogs (such as Bulldogs, Australian Shepherds, Labradors, or German Shepherds) will likely carry a higher price. At CodaPet, most vets charge a flat fee for both dogs and cats; however, if there is a large pet fee, it will be applied automatically for you to review in the price estimate when you reserve an appointment. You can view the detailed [pricing and availability here](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment) or call us at (833) 263 - 2738.

### What should I expect during an in home pet euthanasia appointment?

After arrival at your home, a conversation will be initiated to understand what has been going on with your pet. A brief assessment of your pet's condition will also be performed by the veterinarian. Typically, this assessment is more of an understanding of the pet's quality of life and what has led you to make this decision. We will never move forward with any aspect of the procedure, until you are ready and comfortable that you are making the right decision. We are here to support you during the decision making process. Following the discussion, your pet will be given sedation via a syringe and small needle - some pets may react with signs of momentary discomfort when they feel the small pinch, but others show no response. After approximately 5-15 minutes, your pet will be comfortable and sleeping. Once you are ready, a second injection is given that peacefully helps your pet to transition into an unconscious state by stopping breathing and the heart. As the body transitions, twitching and abnormal breathing can sometimes be seen. This is a normal reaction and is not a sign that your pet is experiencing any sort of discomfort. Along each step of the way, you will have as much time as you need to spend with your pet.

### Can I choose a specific veterinarian for my pet’s euthanasia?

Yes, you can always choose the veterinarian you prefer, at the times they have available to reserve. You can see their [real-time availability](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment) or request a [same-day urgent appointment](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request) if no time suits your needs.

If you have any questions or specific needs, please don’t hesitate to reach out at (833) 263 - 2738.

Yes, your local veterinarian offers in-person and tele-consults depending on availability for a separate fee. In order to reserve a time to speak with a local veterinarian, please call 833-263-2738.

  
**Note:** This consultation is aimed at providing advice on end-of-life care and quality-of-life questions. Your veterinarian is not offering telemedicine and is not able to provide specific diagnosis or treatments. If you have any medical needs, please visit your primary care veterinarian.

### How far in advance do I need to make an appointment?

The notice for every veterinarian differs, however, most veterinarians require at least a 2-hour notice from the time you need them to arrive at your home. This allows them time to prepare and ensure they can provide the highest level of care and compassion for your pet. It also accounts for their travel time, as your veterinarian may be traveling from many different locations around Denver.  
  
While you can request a [same-day and emergency services](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request), it's always best to contact us as early as possible to ensure availability and to give both you and your veterinarian time to prepare for this important moment.

### What should I expect in terms of my pet’s behavior during the pet euthanasia process?

During the euthanasia process, your pet will be gently guided to a state of peace and comfort. After a sedative is administered, you can expect them to become calm and relaxed, free from any pain or distress. When the final injection is given, your pet will slowly drift off into a deep sleep before passing away peacefully. Your compassionate veterinarian will ensure the process is as gentle and serene as possible, allowing you to be present with your beloved companion in their final moments of love and care.

### Can I be with my pet during the euthanasia process?

Yes, during the in home euthanasia process, you are encouraged to be with your pet throughout the entire process. Being there provides comfort and reassurance to your pet as they pass peacefully.

### How should I prepare my home for my pet’s euthanasia?

Everyone’s experience in saying goodbye to their beloved companion is different and very personal. It’s important to consider that you know your pet best. Some considerations, however, are choosing a comfortable space where your pet feels safe, sometimes their favorite spot in your home. Another consideration can be to gather any family members who wish to be present and feel free to bring your pet’s favorite blanket or toys, etc that make them feel comfortable. When your veterinarian arrives they will guide you through each step in the process and help you move at your pace to ensure the process is as peaceful as possible.

### How long does the euthanasia procedure typically take?

_"The euthanasia procedure can take as much time as you need. Typically, most appointments last 30-45 minutes, but you have a full hour should you need it. Once sedated, the effects of the initial sedation are usually noted within 5-15 minutes. When you are ready, the next step is the second injection that aids in the peaceful transition. Once the second injection is administered, the respirations and heart usually stop in 30 seconds to 2 minutes. After the procedure, you can take as much time as you need to say goodbye to your pet." -_ Dr. Sara Gardhouse

### What should I do after the euthanasia procedure is completed?

After the euthanasia, you are welcome to spend as much time as you need with your pet to say goodbye. If you’ve chosen any cremation services to handle your pet’s body, your veterinarian will reconfirm your choices and gently transport your pet when you are ready. If you’ve chosen any keepsakes offered by the crematorium, like Claw Paw Prints, Ink nose prints, or other memorabilia, your veterinarian will reconfirm your choices before leaving your home. If you have any questions or want to change your mind about any of your choices, you can discuss your options with your veterinarian before they leave your home.

### What are my options for cremation

After the in home euthanasia procedure, your veterinarian will provide you with time to say goodbye to your pet. Once you're ready, they will re-confirm the preferred aftercare option that you choose when reserving your time with your veterinarian. In Denver you can select three types of cremation services:  


  * **Private Cremation (Ashed Returned)** : A private cremation is a process where your pet is the only pet in the chamber ensuring only your pet was cremated at the time. Once the process is complete, your pet’s ashes are recovered and reunited with you. Your pet’s ashes will be returned to you in an urn of your choice. If you choose an additional urn then your pet’s ashes will be returned in the urn of your choice.  

  * **Individual Cremation (Ashes Returned)** : An individual cremation is a process where your pet will be cremated separated with physical barriers in the chamber. This ensures the separation with other pets in the chamber so you may reunite with your pet’s ashes. Your pet’s ashes will be returned to you in an urn of your choice. If you choose an additional urn then your pet’s ashes will be returned in the urn of your choice.  

  * **Communal Cremation (No Ashes Returned)** : A communal cremation is a process where your pet is cremated in a chamber with other pets. Once the process is complete, the crematorium will respectfully scatter your pet’s remains among other pets. It’s important to note, you pet’s ashes will not be returned to you.  




**Our local vets shares info about the crematoriums they work with:**

_"I work with Lasting Paws Pet Memorial Services. They are a beautiful facility that will provide your pet with the most love and respect in their afterlife. At the aftercare facility, you have the option to elect for communal or individual cremation.  
  
When you elect for communal cremation, your pet is gently placed into the crematory together with other pets. You will not receive the ashes back, but your pet will be spread over a large private ranch in Colorado.   
  
Individual cremation allows you the opportunity to keep your pet's remains as a permanent and personal keepsake. Once the cremation process is complete, you will receive your pets cremated remains back to you via mail in 7-10 days. The remains are returned in a complimentary urn of your choice. The reason that I selected this specific aftercare facility is the heartfelt caring nature of the staff and the utmost respect that they provide to every single pet. The facility also uses leading edge technology to keep your pet safe from start to finish. Lasting Paws uses a proprietary tracking system that tracks your pet through their aftercare journey. They are assigned a unique identification number that is scanned at each step of the way to ensure your pet is safe and identified throughout the process.   
  
I was very impressed when I visited the facility and felt comfortable that I knew your family members would be very well taken care of throughout the process." - _Dr. Sara Gardhouse  
  
 _"I exclusively utilize Lasting Paws Pet Memorial Services to handle the aftercare of my patients. I have been familiar with their facilities since 2011 when they were known as Pet Cremation Services. While the company has changed hands, they have always shown the utmost respect to every pet and client. What has improved over the years is the tracking system for every patient. Lasting Paws has software that electronically scans each pet’s identification at every step of the cremation and memorial keepsake creation process, ensuring accountability at all times. Furthermore, they have taken care of several of my own animals over the years and I would never use anyone else.  
_

_In addition to the communal and individual cremation options, I offer private cremation through Lasting Paws, meaning that the crematory unit is reserved for your pet–they are the only ones there and their ashes are returned to you as arranged during the euthanasia visit in your home." -_ Dr _._ Lori Schmalz  


### How do I get my pet’s ashes back?

Your veterinarian will coordinate the return of your pet’s ashes before they leave your home. Your options include having your pet’s remains delivered by your veterinarian (for an additional fee), shipping them to you (for an additional fee), or picking them up from your primary clinic or the crematorium.

### Do You Offer In-Home Euthanasia for Pets Other Than Dogs and Cats?

In Denver and the surrounding suburbs, our local vets are experienced in providing compassionate in-home euthanasia for horses, bovine, ovine, camelids, porcine, and other small mammals in addition to dogs and cats.

For some small or exotic pets, we may recommend a brief consultation in advance so we can best prepare and answer any specific questions you have.

We also offer respectful aftercare options, including private or communal cremation, depending on the size of your pet and your preferences.

If you're unsure whether we can assist with your pet, please call us at (833) 263-2738 and we’ll be happy to help.

> We are so grateful to Dr. Sarah Clem for the calm, loving presence she brought into our home during such a difficult time. From the moment she arrived, we felt respected—not only in our home, but throughout the entire process. I didn’t even realize in-home euthanasia was an option, and I can honestly say the experience was as peaceful and comforting as it could possibly be. Her compassion made an unbearable moment feel gentle and dignified. We will always be thankful.

> Dr. Orth was wonderful! She responded very quickly, which seemed like a miracle for us. She was very thorough and kind with our distressed older cat. She quickly assessed our cat Ronnie and agreed it was time. She explained what she would do and what would happen. She was very gentle and kind with our pet. She arrived totally prepared and acted to calm Ronnie and make the visit as comforting as possible. We can’t say enough good things about her professionalism and kindness to our pet and my husband and me. It’s very clear she loves animals. We would highly recommend her to help your cat in Sanger, CA area.

> Using CodaPet was so easy; from searching for a vet near me to clear pricing. Once booked they remained in constant communication with me throughout the process, providing time updates, etc. Our family was matched with Dr.Kelsey Jones and I can not recommend her enough. She arrived promptly, listened to our concerns, examined our furbaby Ciddy and gave us ample time to grieve and make the final decision. At no moment did I feel pressured to rush. She gave us time to set up an area outside and spoke to us like a friend throughout the process, while treating all of us with respect and compassion. She even made a suggestion on how to allow our other dog to say goodbye (which I would never have thought of). It’s not an easy choice to let go of a beloved pet but i feel this was the best way to do it and highly recommend her services.

> After making the difficult decision to help our elderly bulldog cross the rainbow bridge, we found CodaPet online, offering in-home euthanasia. Our dog was a large breed and could hardly walk, and I couldn’t bear the thought of transporting her to a cold clinic for her final moments with us. Dr. Michelli arrived at our home and was so kind and gentle with our sweet girl; she explained to us how things would work and gave us time to answer any questions. We were so thankful to be able to say our final goodbyes to our fur baby in the privacy of our home and with her in the comfort of her own bed. Our hearts are broken by the loss, but I couldn’t have wished for a better way to have gone about this experience. Thank you, Dr. M and CodaPet. 🙏🏻🌈

> A very wonderful caring , warm and compassionate Dr Sara Gardhouse was the right person in my life to take care of my needs when it came to the final day of Rex’s life here on earth. She was accommodating to where I wanted. Rex euthanized . That to me was the greatest gift of all. Even though it rained all day, we went forward, so Rex wouldn’t suffer anymore. She answered questions I had after the procedure, when I was overwhelmed with heartbreak and grief, stating she was there for me if I needed. Dr. Sara Gardhouse, I can’t say enough how grateful I had her by our side, it was comforting. I would recommend her to anyone that needs in-home or out of home euthanasia. You’re in the best care with this great doctor.. thank you Leia Hanson

> We had a sudden need for home pet euthanasia for our beloved little dog, Jellybean. None of our local vets offered the service timely, so we had to try an unknown. I found CodaPet online and there were appointments available. Dr. Gordon at CodaPet was wonderful. The whole process went smoothly. Communication was thorough. She was a little late, but kept us updated (because you can't rush these things). She said all the right things and comforted us in our decision. We are heartbroken, but at least this part will be a good memory. Our pup was at home, peaceful, and not stressed out by being at the vet. We pet him, cried, told stories, and he just fell asleep. People who provide this service are special people. We SO appreciated being home for his final day. We would not hesitate to recommend Dr. Gordon if you unfortunately need this service.

> On 07/29/2025, our 14-year-old Goldendoodle, Teddy, passed away peacefully. Dr. Gardhouse was very compassionate. When she arrived, she started to rub Teddy's paw. The thing is that Teddy never liked his paws rubbed, but in this case, it soothed him. Dr. Gardhouse explained the procedure well and answered our questions. She gave us plenty of time to say our goodbyes, and nothing was rushed. We will miss him dearly, but Dr. Gardhouse made the process so much better. We are so glad we did it at home. Also, compared to other services, the price for the service was way more reasonable. I highly recommend using CodaPet. John D.

> Sara came to our house to help us send our 17yo girl Poppi to the bridge. She was very kind, compassionate, and did everything she could to make sure we were comfortable with the process. We could tell that she really cared about us and Poppi, even though she had just met her. Sara made sure Poppi was comfortable and then made sure we were ready to let her go to the bridge. While this will always be the worst day for any pet parent, Sara made this day a lot easier with her kindness and care toward Poppi and us. Thank you for making this day just a bit easier. We do appreciate everything you did. Cat Raley

> Amazing. I went online in the morning at 6am and scheduled for 11am. They even have a link for more urgent response. Dr. Alex was incredibly compassionate and professional. I had never heard of this service before and my friend recommended it. Hands down this is the only way i will ever do this again. The gratitude i have for Dr. Alex and her service cannot be understated. I was very moved by the experience. My kitty had zero stress; i placed her on my lap while i sat on the bed. Dr. Alex was so gentle and kind. I cannot praise enough. Thank you so much.

She gave us the time and space we needed and treated our cat with such care and dignity. I especially appreciated that she brought a basket to carry our cat after she had passed. It was a small detail, but it meant a lot during such an emotional moment. I am very grateful for her gentleness and professionalism.

He was extremely stressed out when he was at the dog hospital/vets office so we decided to bring him home and let him go peacefully in his favorite spot in the yard. He was loved and comfortable as much as he could be during the experience. Thank you Dr. Sara ❤️

> I had to make the painful decision of putting my dog, Luna, down, and wanted to do it at home. Not only was the price fair, but Dr. Gardhouse was amazing. She came earlier than the scheduled arrival time, had a very calm and caring demeanor, and answered all questions. She worked at my pace and enjoyed watching us give my girl a last meal of chicken nuggets, popcorn, and chocolate chips cookies. This decision was not easy, but Dr. Gardhouse was the perfect provider to use. She took great care of my girl and even sent a follow up card in the mail sending her regards. Could not recommend her enough, there’s a special place for humans like her that do this work?
