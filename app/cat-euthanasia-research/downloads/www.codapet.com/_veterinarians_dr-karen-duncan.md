Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

Whenever possible, people want to be able to go home from the hospital for their remaining days, to die at home. Families want the same for their pets. As in-home pet euthanasia has finally become a viable option, I knew I could add value to the euthanasia experience because of my veterinary experience and my compassion for those pet parents who are deeply grieved over the loss of their four-legged family member. I see this as my calling, to care for the members of my local community.

## What pet parents are saying

> Our precious Lab of 14 years became incapacitated after an extended illness on New Years Day when everything is closed. I managed to get ahold of Dr. Duncan who was able to take time out of her holiday to come help us with our extremely difficult decision to end our baby's suffering. She was so kind and thoughtfully laid out everything that was going to happen. She didn't rush the process and respectfully gave us time to grieve. Dr. Duncan made an awful situation bearable and we were so lucky to find her. She's the best!

> Dr Duncan (Karen) was an outstanding and extremely caring person. She arrived on schedule but more importantly she was exceptionally gentle with Kobe and over the top compassionate. Kobe was an extremely loved dog who we were permitted to have in our lives for 15+ years. The house is now empty, and our normal routines are confusing for us, but we know that Kobe is in a place of rest and thanks Karen he will continue to rest peacefully. We cannot nor or ever thank Karen enough. Bruce

Dr. Duncan assured us we were making the correct decision, as well as assuring us we were giving our goofy boy, Logan the most peaceful transition. We have recommended this organization & Dr. Duncan to all our fur baby friends.🧡

> There is nobody better we could have hoped for to be with us and our dog Riley at the end. Karen was immensely compassionate, professional, and accommodating when the time came. Her bio says that she feels a calling to this work and the amount of comfort and warmth she offered us on that difficult evening will stay with us forever. Words fall short to express the amount of gratitude that we feel to Karen for her assistance. It is clear that, to anyone who has a pet that they consider family, there is nobody better suited in our area than Dr Karen Duncan to care for your loved one on that painful, sad day, as if they were her own. Thank you for everything Karen!

> Dr. Duncan is so compassionate and caring and made such a heartbreaking experience a little easier to bear. We made the difficult decision to put down our senior kitty Angus, and we knew we wanted him to be comfortable at home and with his family when he passed over the rainbow bridge. I called CodaPet late on a Friday afternoon and Karen called us back within 20 minutes. She was able to come to our home later the same day and she was just amazing. Karen put us at ease, explained the process, and treated Angus as if he was her own. If you are contemplating having your per euthanized at home, I would highly recommend Dr. Duncan and CodaPet. The extra expense is priceless.

> In home pet Euthanasia: This is a very hard review to write because it is about our personal loss of our beloved pet Lucy. Lucy's decline was very sudden and unexpected. While she was 14 years old she was very energenic and still got the zoomies once in awhile. Within a few minutes of coming back from her routine walk, she collapsed. She was diagnosed with Vestibular syndrome (inner/middle ear) and was expected to improve within 24-48 hours, but she did not. When we made the decision that it was time to say goodbye, we wanted to do it at home. We wanted her to be comfortable and surrounded by her loved ones. We didn't want to put her through anymore distress of driving her somewhere. Afterall, how many pets are excited to go to the vet?! We found Dr. Karen Duncan and she could not have been anymore caring and compassionate towards us and Lucy. She also evaluated Lucy to validate we were making the right decision. She explained everything to us and took her time. We did not feel rushed whatsoever. She took care of everything. While it is not a decision anyone likes to make, we would encourage others when that time comes to consider In-Home-Pet-Euthanasia. Be there for your pet in their loving surroundings.

> Dr. Karen Duncan is a loving beautiful soul, an angel. Words cannot express our sincere gratitude. She was so kind, caring and compassionate walking us through the entire process. Having to euthanize a fur baby is one of the hardest things to do. Dr. Karen understood how hard this was for us to lose our sweet 16-year-old kitty, Mickey. She took the time to listen, let us share how special our fur baby Mickey was/is. Her presence and demeanor made all of us feel comfortable. We were able to pet Mickey and love him up in his last final moments – a true blessing as we know he passed peacefully and gracefully. Dr. Karen gave us time to say one last final goodbye, making sure his younger brothers and sister had time to say goodbye as well. She then, with the utmost of kindness, wrapped Mickey in a blanket and placed him in a beautiful basket. We highly recommend Dr. Karen to anyone who loves their pet as family and is faced with the difficult decision to euthanize.

She spoke to my girl Jada, so sweetly and respectfully, and her compassion was just so genuine. We felt completely supported and cared for, and she gave us the space and time we needed to say our goodbyes. We will always be thankful for how she helped us navigate this devastating experience with such grace."

> Making the decision to say goodbye to your pet is hard enough. CodaPet and Dr. Karen Duncan (local to us) made the experience as easy and peaceful as possible. The website has tons of info and FAQs and the ability to schedule online. Dr. Duncan reached out in advance to see if we had any questions and put us at ease with the process, she gave us a few things to think about leading up to the appointment. Upon arrival Dr. Duncan was very pleasant, she took the time to allow us to share about our pet and his favorite things, we were able to do the process out on our porch, since that was his favorite place to relax. She talked us through the process step by step of what we can expect, and allowed us to ask questions. Once we began the process she was very thorough, didn't rush anything, and made sure we were ready for each step. She was attentive and allowed us all the time we needed as we said goodbye. She was informative on next steps and wishes and followed up with us later in the day just to check in. This was just a professional and genuine process all around. I highly recommend CodaPet and Dr. Karen Duncan, as I said, saying goodbye is already so hard, we couldn't bear the thought of putting our cat in a carrier, driving to the vet, and going through this process in a clinical environment. We were in the comfort of our own home and were able to say goodbye to our pet peacefully and safely.

Afterward she carefully wrapped our little one in a cozy blanket and put her in a soft basket. We couldn't be more grateful. Thank you so much, Karen.

> In-home pet euthanasia. Saying good-bye to Micky was one of the most difficult days of my life. Dr. Karen arrived at our home and I could tell she was heaven sent. Her warmth, caring and concern from the moment we met was comforting. She was in contact with us a few days prior to help us prepare. Even though Micky was somewhat sedated already, she greeted him with a soft touch and a quiet hello. He even gave her a really good side stretch. We sat and chatted about our life with Micky until it was time. The three step process was gentle and quiet. We held Micky's head and petted him though the whole process. He went so quietly and peacefully. Since we were having him cremated, Dr. Karen had a small stretcher to carry him out on. The stretcher as covered in the softest, comfiest blanket. We wrapped Micky in it and he was carried out to her car. When we went out to say good-bye to Micky one more time, she had placed a remembrance sign and stone near him. It was perfect and he was at peace. If you choose to have Dr. Karen come to your home, I highly recommend Coda Pet services.

She made a terrible moment in time beautiful and peaceful for our cat and for us. We were very emotional and she gave us our time and guided us through the process. Cymba was very ready, very sick and at the end of life. She told us we were giving him a beautiful gift. I appreciated those words more than she will ever know. I don't wish anyone to lose their furry loved ones but if the time comes I highly recommend Dr. Karen.

> My Girl Chloe was a cherished family member. Unfortunately, her health had declined and we had to make a life ending decision that was very upsetting for everyone. We could not bear to take her anywhere to have the euthanasia done. We thought it was important to have this done at home where she is most comfortable. The in-home pet euthanasia was done by Dr. Karen Duncan. We had not met Karen, but when she came, she immediately put us at ease. She took her time with Chloe, and was very compassionate and understanding. She was here with us for at least an hour and explained the process in detail allowing time for us to absorb the procedure as needed. She then wrapped Chloe up in a warm blanket and transported her with TLC. I cannot say enough about Karen and the process that was done at our house. It gave us complete privacy, a special time to spend with Chloe and the opportunity to send her off in a very quiet, compassionate, and cherished way. Karen is obviously a special person to provide a service for those families having separation anxiety from their cherished pets. We appreciate all that was done to help us send Chloe off in a quiet and dignified way. We would highly recommend this, if you want that special time helping that cherished family member cross the Rainbow Bridge!

> The experience of having to put a loved pet to sleep is heartbreaking. This was the 4th time in my adult life of having to make this decision. I always stay with mine until the last heartbeat. First 3 were done at the vets office but for Lucy, a rescued and worshipped pit bull, we discovered Codapet and Dr Karen Duncan and it was the best decision we made. No stress of getting them in the car and taking them to a place they hate. Lucy died in her living room on her favorite blankets surrounded by her loved ones. Codapet took care of her body. Dr Duncan was caring and kind and Lucy died peacefully. It may cost a little more than the traditional method but it was worth every penny.

> Dr. Duncan was very warm, caring, and immensely helpful during a very difficult time. Nigel was a wonderful cat - more dog than cat. He still greeted us at the door, demanded pets, and sat in our laps whenever we sat still long enough. But he had a huge tumor under his tongue, he had lost so much weight, and eating was so painful he could only attempt with a dose of pain medicine. He couldn’t groom himself anymore and his fur was covered in mats. And yet he still sought out love and affection, so we were so torn about what to do. Dr. Duncan helped us process all those emotions and facts and was completely caring and supportive. She allowed us to give Nigel the gift of dying without prolonged suffering, and without an anxiety ridden last day of a thirty minute car ride to the vet in a cat carrier in a sterile vets office smelling of fear and pain. He died peacefully in his own home without fear. I’m so grateful.

> I recently had to make the heartbreaking decision of letting my Lexi go over the Rainbow Bridge. We rescued her at 9 months and she turned 14 on March 1st. We were so lucky to have had her in our lives and I know she changed many minds about Pitbull’s over the years, as she was the sweetest, gentle and loving girl. I want to thank Dr. Karen Duncan - Certified Peaceful Euthanasia Veterinarian from CodaPet who helped me through this difficult journey. Dr. Karen came to my home and showed the utmost care and compassion during this time, it felt like having a family member with me. We sat together on the floor while Lexi laid on her favorite bed, enjoying all the love and attention we both gave to her while she passed. I cannot say enough about how grateful I am for the kindness Dr. Karen showed, not only that day but the days since, by cards, email and messages.

> We originally had an appointment with another in home euthanasia that was 5 days away and when we knew our beloved Charlie wasn’t going to make it that long I did a google search and found CodaPet and Dr. Karen. It was late at night and I was able to make an appointment for the next day. It is so hard saying goodbye but Dr Karen made it the best it could be. She explained everything and had the best bed side manners. She was so caring and empathetic! I would highly recommend Dr Karen Duncan and CodaPet. Thank you! 🐾🌈
