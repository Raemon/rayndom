Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

During my first year of vet school, my 14 year old black lab named Buddy had a suspected stroke. After some intense nursing care and him showing no improvement, we made the heartbreaking decision to have him euthanized. This was truly one of the most difficult times in my life, but having my family and a supportive doctor around me made the experience more manageable. I didn’t really know about in home euthanasia at that time, but I know it’s what I would’ve preferred for Buddy, as he was always anxious at the vet. Providing this service to families in the comfort of their own homes is truly what I feel called to do within this profession, and discovering this option during vet school helped develop my passion for in home euthanasia.

> Dr. Tolbert was so kind and compassionate with our dog, Cooper. We contacted her after hours because we knew Cooper was struggling so badly and would not make it through the night. Watching him go through that pain was too hard. She arrived at our house within a short time and we were able to send him off in a peaceful way in the comfort of his home. Initially I did not know how it would be putting our dog down in our home, but after this experience I realize it was what we owed to Cooper. He gave us unconditional love for so many years, so being able to say our goodbye to him in a peaceful setting was the right thing to do. We appreciated the kindness and compassion of Dr. Tolbert so much and highly recommend her and this service when the time comes for your pet.
