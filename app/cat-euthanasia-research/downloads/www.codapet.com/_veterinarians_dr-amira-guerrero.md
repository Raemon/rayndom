Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

Since I can remember I have always wanted to work with animals and being a veterinarian allowed me to pursue that dream. In 2022 my hospice kitty was ready to cross the rainbow bridge and I wanted to have her pass at home. Being able to perform an in-home euthanasia for her, on the couch she always laid on, was the greatest gift for her and me. After experiencing it myself, I knew how precious an in-home euthasia was and I wanted to offer that to the community.

> Dr Amira was excellent. She allowed our sweet little minpin, Salty to peacefully cross the rainbow bridge without fear or stress, which was all we could have asked for during a terrible time for my husband and I. Thank you with all our hearts Dr Amira.

> This summer my husband and I contacted CodaPet after we learned that our sixteen-year-old Yorkie, Lucy, was in kidney failure. We decided that at-home pet euthanasia was the best option for us, but we didn't know what to expect. CodaPet put us in touch with Dr. Amira Guerrero, and we were easily able to set up an appointment for the next morning. On what was one of the saddest days of our lives, Dr. Guerrero's professionalism and calm manner brought us so much peace and comfort. She took such good care of our sweet Lucy. We are so grateful to her, and highly recommend her services through CodaPet.

> Sadly it was time to say goodbye to our sweet old Daschund. We chose in home euthanasia as it would be more comfortable for our baby. The Doctor came exactly when she said she would & was extremely kind & gentle. Highly recommend Coda & Dr Amira Guerrero.

> It's taken me about three weeks to be able to post this. I met Dr. Guerrero at the emergency care facility after my cat Molly had a bleeding event. Dr. G diagnosed her with an oral cancer. It was incredibly difficult, but Dr. G's kind treatment of it made it bearable, and I began to care for Molly in a hospice-like setting at my home. When her time came some 7 or 8 weeks later, I made sure to schedule the in-home visit with Dr. Guerrero. She was on time, kind and very compassionate. We talked over Molly's condition first, and she reassured me about my decision. The process, while incredibly sad for me, was handled as well as I could imagine. Dr. G was gentle and kind to Molly. She was never in a rush. When it was over, she even brought in a little basket for Molly, and covered her in a blanket like she was sleeping and took her for cremation. A few days later Dr. G came by herself and delivered Molly's remains and a paw print souvenir. She was very kind and I think would have stayed to talk as long as I wanted, but I was still pretty inconsolable. I would recommend Dr. G when that time comes for you and your family. Thank you, Dr. Guerrero.
