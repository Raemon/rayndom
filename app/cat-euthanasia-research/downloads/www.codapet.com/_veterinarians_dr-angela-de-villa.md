Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I offer in-home euthanasia because it can transform a profoundly sad moment into a deeply personal and peaceful farewell. The clinical environment of a veterinary office can be overwhelming and distressing, not just for pets but for owners as well. At home, the process can be gentler and less traumatic, allowing for a more natural transition. I am dedicated to honoring the beautiful bond between pets and their owners. My ultimate goal is to allow pets to pass away in a familiar, peaceful setting that honors their dignity.

> Dr. De Villa was so kind and sweet as she assisted both of my senior cats with end of life care. She was kind to them as they passed and so kind to me. She showed compassion and empathy for all of us through a most difficult decision to say goodbye.

> Dr. Angela kept us posted about her arrival time, which we appreciated. Her 'good vibes" were immediately apparent. She steps lightly and speaks gently. She explained, ahead of time, exactly what she would be doing for Frankie, and was willing and able to work with Frankie on my lap. She listened carefully to Frankie's heart, and let us know when it stopped beating. She gave us some private moments, and returned with a basket and blankets. My grandson was able to place Frankie into the carry basket. Thank you, Dr De Villa, for being who you are in this crazy old world, so that we could give Frankie our final gift of peace.

> Dr. DeVilla provided us the experience we were looking for with the in-home euthansia for our cherished Archie! Everything went as expected. Dr. DeVilla brought peace and grace to a tough time for our family. We have been through the process in the vet office with two previous pets and this was just a little more relaxed and easy on all of us. Our pet passed in complete comfort. Don't know how Dr. DeVilla does it every day but she does it very well. Highly recommend her services. Thank you so much!

> The thought of having to say goodbye to my best friend was unbearable but I knew with the option of having him pass in the comfort of his home was a must. I was able to lay and snuggle with my baby while he went peacefully and Sarah was so thoughtful, kind and patient with us and our Nanook boy.

> Dear Dr. Angela De Villa, helping our sweet doggy, Chocolate, be comfortable and at peace was the kindest, most humane service I have ever been witness to. She was the heartbeat of our household, and she is very missed. But we can feel good knowing she is free now from pain. The whole procedure was fast, but not rushed. Professional, and yet full of compassion. My family thanks you a thousand times over for being warm, understanding, and kind.

> Angela was great. She came highly recommended by my vet. She gave great guidance beforehand. We were back and forth on whether my wife and I wanted the kids there. I understand that she runs a business but the customer service and empathy made the experience as good as it could be under the circumstances. Although it was a sad moment, she also helped in making it beautiful experience shared amongst the whole family. Thank you so much.

> I'm so grateful I found this company when searching for an in home pet euthanasia company. When it became clear it was time to say goodbye to my soul dog, I was able to book an appointment at the last minute, and Dr. De Villa was very compassionate and reached out right away. She was gentle, empathetic, and truly made a heartbreaking situation as peaceful and beautiful as it could possibly be. My dog was comfortable and surrounded by love in their familiar surroundings, which made all the difference. I can't thank them enough for providing such a calm and respectful passing. I highly recommend their services to anyone facing this difficult time.

> We are beyond grateful to Dr. Angela De Villa for the incredible compassion and care she showed during one of the most difficult moments our family has ever faced. Saying goodbye to our beloved dog Benny was heartbreaking, but Dr. Angela made the experience peaceful, dignified, and filled with empathy. As young pet owners going through this process for the first time, we were full of questions, uncertainty, and emotion. Upon arrival, Dr. Angela immediately validated our decision with warmth and understanding. She gently evaluated Benny’s current state, helping us feel reassured that we were making the most loving choice for him—even though it was incredibly hard. Her calm, steady presence brought comfort and clarity to a situation that felt overwhelming. What truly stood out was the way she had prepared her vehicle for Benny’s final journey to cremation—softly lit with floral arrangements and set up with such thoughtful care. It felt more like a tribute than a transport, and it meant the world to us knowing he was treated with such dignity. That level of care meant the world to us. She treated Benny not just as a pet, but as a cherished soul. She walked us through every step of the process with patience and deep compassion. Her tenderness with Benny, and her respect for his life and our love for him, was unforgettable. We never felt rushed, only supported. Dr. Angela also provided us with keepsakes to remember Benny—beautiful, thoughtful mementos that we will always hold close. They brought a sense of peace and connection that continues even now. Thanks to Dr. Angela, Benny was able to spend his final moments at home, surrounded by the people who loved him most. We will forever be grateful for the grace, professionalism, and heart she brought to one of the hardest days of our lives. We wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Angela to any pet family facing this impossible goodbye. Her presence was a true gift, and we will never forget her care for Benny—and for us.

> can’t say enough good things about Dr. De Villa. She cared for our sweet Sadie during one of the most heartbreaking moments of our lives, and her presence made all the difference. From the moment she walked in, her calm and loving energy helped ease some of the weight we were carrying. She treated Sadie with such gentleness, compassion, and respect, and she treated us the same. What truly blew me away was the handwritten note I received from her afterward. It was so personal, so sincere—it showed just how deeply she cares, not just for her patients, but for the families behind them. In such a painful time, her empathy brought real comfort. I will always be grateful to Dr. De Villa for the grace, compassion, and care she gave us. She is truly special.

> We really appreciated the end-of-life services of Dr. Angela De Villa and CodaPet. When our elderly cat, who had been in decline, suddenly took a sharp downturn and was clearly struggling, I was able to make a same-day appointment for at-home euthanasia with Dr. De Villa for the earliest time available. When she heard about our cat struggling, she texted me to move the appointment earlier. It was such a gift to be able to put him to sleep in our own home without additional stress. Dr. De Villa was thoughtful and empathetic, explaining each step in the process, and allowing us to determine when to proceed at each point. We're so grateful.

> It is difficult to even think about sending Foxy and Chica, our almost 17 year old sister Chihauhau mix pups over the rainbow together. It has been 5 days since they took their journey. Angela was so comforting. I did not want to stress them going to their veterinarian office. It was a peaceful transition, thanks to Dr. Angela DeVilla for taking her time and letting us process the procedure which she explained really well.
