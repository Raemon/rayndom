Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

Ive always been an animal lover growing up, and though I have worked a variety of careers, I always ended up back with animals. I worked in clinical practice and enjoyed spending time with my clients, holding their hands as we talked through different disease outcomes and treatment plans, and, eventually crying with them during their last visit as they said goodbye to their pet. I wanted to provide in-home euthanasia so that people could spend the time saying goodbye at their own pace.

## What pet parents are saying

> We made the tough decision to help our 16-year-old Pomeranian cross over. I can't describe how much it meant to me to hold him in my arms as he gently passed while telling me how much I loved him. Dr. Lauren Frary was incredible. She was gentle, knew the right words, and spent time with my family and our little one. She even recommended chocolate, which I 100% agree with. All dogs deserve chocolate before they go. I would pay for the service over and over again just to be able to give him such peace and love before he went. Thank you again for making a tough time a lot easier and being able to have closure.

> Dr Frary was incredibly compassionate and gave us plenty of time to say goodbye to our cat Monkey. I can't believe the difference between in clinic and at home. Our good boy wasn't scared and I held him the whole time. For the circumstances it was a really good experience. I would credit that to Dr Frary helping us as much as Monkey through it.

> Our dog seemed to develop a condition where he was becoming paralyzed from his tail to his head. It was over the course of a couple of weeks. We took him to 4 different vets who “treated the symptoms” but nothing worked. It cost us a couple of thousand dollars and we were no closer to a solution. He was suffering and they refused to euthanize him bc he was ‘too young”, being only 5 yrs old. We were so sad watching him diminish daily w no real help in sight. Dr. Lauren Frary came to our home and was the most kind and loving w him and us. She handled the situation very professionally. Of course we didn’t want him to go. We love him dearly. We just didn’t want him to suffer, and he absolutely was, w no real diagnosis or end in sight. We cannot thank Dr. Frary enough for her kindness and help during a time that was super difficult. It had been made so much worse than necessary by others who just wanted to run more tests but w no real solutions. Thank you w all of our hearts for your service!

> This service is a game changer. Dr. Lauren was so kind and compassionate. This process is NEVER easy but the calm and peace I felt being able to offer relief to my beloved, aging pet's suffering in this way alleviates so much of the questioning and guilt. There were still plenty of tears, but we felt comfortable with Dr. Lauren right away. She eased our pain over the loss as well. I will always be grateful and would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone. CodeaPet is truly a tender mercy.

> Dr. Lauren Frary was so very compassionate and took all the time we needed to to say goodbye to our beloved , loyal and best friend, our golden retriever Bear. We will never not use in home euthanasia for our other dogs if it’s needed. She made Bear feel so calm. It’s the hardest thing to know when to say goodbye, but she made it bearable for us. We miss him terribly, but we know it was the right thing to do, and especially the right place to say goodbye instead of having him so anxious and scared in a vets office. We highly recommend Dr. Lauren Thank you so much for making this time bearable.

> The decision to have to put an beloved pet down is a hard one. CodaPet made scheduling an at home service so simple that you could navigate it even when crying. The rates were less then we were expecting, and they had availability the next day. Lauren is a god send to grieving pet parents, and pets alike. She was calming, thoughtful, and very considerate. She explained the whole procedure, and somethings that we could expect so that there was no surprises. She was so sweet to Amber Blue, assessing her needs and giving her a calm presence. Our precious pup went quietly and comfortably after fighting lymphoma. We are very grateful to Lauren, and to CodaPet for offering this experience. We are also grateful for the option to cremate and get an urn and some keepsake ceramic paw prints. Thank you so much for everything.

> Lauren (Dr. Frary) was amazing. This was our first time going through this and it was extremely difficult and emotional for our family. We weren't sure at first if this was the best option for our cat, but Lauren looked him over and considered his history and made an objective, professional assessment that this was a good option for him, but never pressured us one way or another. I was so impressed with Lauren's softness, kindness, and understanding of all of our concerns and answered all of our questions. And she was so conscientious and considerate of our pain. From the exact words she used to her gentle mannerisms to the beautiful basket and blanket she brought to take care of our boy, her consideration and kindness and how she did nothing to rush us nor pressure us means that I have been recommending her to anyone with an interest in this service. It costs a bit, but letting our boy go in the kindest, most humane, loving, and gentle way was worth every penny.

> We are glad that Dr Lauren Frary was the one who got to help us with our little Chloe. She was caring and very compassionate at a time when we needed all the care in the world as we went through the toughest time in our family. We didn’t feel rushed at all and we were given everything we needed as we navigated such a tough day. We had to push our appt several days earlier, with only a couple hours notice before she came to our home…and she was right there to accommodate us, and for that we’re so grateful. Dr Frary gave excellent care and even took paw prints of our girl, which we received in the mail. She took a lot of our worries away on that day, and we will be forever thankful that she got to be the person to help us through the difficult process. I can’t recommend her highly enough.
