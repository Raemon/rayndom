> Dr. Romanos was absolutely wonderful. This was an extremely difficult time for us, and she helped our baby cross the rainbow bridge in the most peaceful way possible. She was patient, gentle, and answered all of our questions with such care, tailoring the conversation to our needs. Dr. Romanos had a calming presence and was incredibly knowledgeable. I will be recommending her to anyone who needs support in helping their pet pass peacefully.
