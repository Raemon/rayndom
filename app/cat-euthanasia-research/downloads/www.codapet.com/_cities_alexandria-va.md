Dr. Lowman was so professional, kind, and compassionate. She let us take our time to say goodbye to our girl and explained the process as she went. She also sent us a personal card a few days after. I highly recommend Dr. Lowman. She made the process as easy as possible.

Dr. Derecka Alexander was very helpful and caring in our time of need. We had to say goodbye to a young boy battling health issues and Dr was very calming, supportive and informative with all of our care. Being able to do it in the comfort of his space for a 100+ lb boy was a big deal for us and him. We really appreciate Dr Alexander

Recent Pet Parent Review

(18) reviews

With tremendous heartache and anguish, on Thursday, June 26th, I had to say goodbye to my best friend and soul mate Kaya Sletzinger. She was a 10 year 3 month old Leonberger, who had been struggling with some health issues, most notably arthritis. If you have been through this before as a dog owner, then you know how burdensome it is. If you are a more recent dog owner, and haven’t been through this experience, it may seem unfathomable. I have been around dogs for all of my life, and I know that they’re absolutely the best things in this world. The only downside is that they don’t live long enough. Unfortunately I have experienced having to go to the veterinary hospital to put my best friend to sleep, but the much better option, is having a doctor come to your house, and doing this procedure at home. This method is called in-home pet euthanasia. I have chosen this recourse when I put my awesome Leonberger Nadja to sleep in 2013, I Love You Nadja! And just a little over a week ago, when I truly believe that The Kaya Baby and myself came to an understanding, and knew what had to be done, I called CodaPet, who put me in touch with Dr. Lauren Silvesti. Everyone who I talked with at CodaPet were so kind, respectful, and professional and my words cannot express how highly I exalt Dr. Lauren Silvesti. From our very first interaction on Wednesday morning, she was compassionate, kind, and accessible. Dr. Lauren Silvesti was willing to answer any questions that I had throughout the day, and whenever I tried to get in touch with her, she was available. Kaya was such an amazing girl who had vastly intense energy. She could be stubborn and mischievous and I loved her for it. Principally though, Kaya was loving and sensitive. She could not tolerate any tension or drama, so I did my best to make sure that she wouldn’t have to. If I had decided to take Kaya to a veterinary hospital to allow her to pass on, then there would have been a lot of added stress for her. I would never allow that to happen. Kaya was a very family oriented girl, so the only option for both of us, was to do this procedure at home. Kaya passed away in my arms while I was hugging her and talking to her. My mom and dad were also there, as well as my sister and brother in-law, along with their two dogs Luney and Ruby. They are both Kaya’s sisters, and everyone who was there loved Kaya so much. I was with my Kaya girl for the whole time, and I sincerely believe that she was at peace. Having to make the decision “when is the right time?” And having to say goodbye to all of my dogs, is by far one of the hardest things that I will have to go through in my life. Dr. Lauren Silvesti made this experience as manageable as possible for all of us. She was so professional, and from beginning to end, the procedure was conducted smoothly, effectively, and tenderly. Thank You Dr. Silvesti! I believe it meant the world to Kaya to have so many people who loved her, there with her, when she needed it most. The Kaya Baby was so full of love, and she loved everybody who was there with her also. RIP Baby Girl and Best Wishes on your next adventure! Also to Baxter, Ruffo, Mila, Dreyfus, and Nadja, I miss you guys and I love you! If you happen to be reading this review and you are going through this agonizing time of saying goodbye to your dog. I wanted to say I’m sorry and I’m sending my heartfelt condolences. I genuinely recommend CodaPet out of Ashburn, Virginia, and Dr. Lauren Silvesti, who I will forever consider a dear friend. They specialize at in-home pet euthanasia, which is a truly valuable service. If there is an option to take this course of action when the time is right, in my opinion it is the best way to go, for the wellbeing of your pet. I’m sending everyone my love and please cherish your time with your pets. Time flies by so fast and life is too short. Sincerely and Respectfully, Jussi Sletzinger

## Pet euthanasia and cremation pricing in Alexandria, VA

### Reservations and payments

Your credit card is required to reserve your appointment. However, no payment is required until the appointment and nothing is due until the appointment is completed

### Cancellation policy or pet passing

We charge cancellation fee of $100 if an appointment is cancelled less than 4 hours before the start time. If your pet passes away before your appointment you would not be charged a cancellation fee. If the vet you scheduled is able, and you would like their assistance with cremation, then pickup fee would apply instead of euthanasia fee

[Personalize Quote](/schedule-appointment "Personalize Quote")

## Other Consideration

### Large Animals

If you have a larger pet, your vet may need the help of one friend or family member. Talk to your vet about options and limitations when they reach out to you prior to your appointment, and they will inform you of any extra cost for your situation. 

### How do I get my pet’s ashes

Options for your pets return home and memorabilia depend on your local provider. Your vet coordinate the return of your pet’s ashes and let you know if there are additional fees for urn delivery. 

### Special factors affecting price

Extra time or medications needed can affect the total price. Other factors can be if it is decided that it’s not time to euthanize your pet after the vet has arrive. In that case, only the travel fee, platform fee, and a quality of life consult would apply. 

## FAQs

### What’s included in the total cost?

The total cost includes the in-home pet euthanasia service fee, any travel fee (if any apply), and a platform fee. Additionally, depending on your choice, fees may apply for cremation services or keepsakes.

### Will the vet take my pet with them after the appointment?

During your appointment, your vet will confirm your aftercare selection with you. If you choose to arrange cremation services, your vet will oversee your pet’s transportation to a local facility for cremation. If your preferred cremation option includes the return of your pet’s ashes to you, your vet will discuss the process to reunite you with your pet's ashes and the anticipated time frame during your appointment

### Will the vet examine my pet once they get to my home?

Yes, upon arrival the veterinarian will assess your pet. This can look different than an “nose to tail” examination in a clinic setting and will focus more on the pet’s history and quality of life.

### What if I am not sure it is time?

It is not uncommon to have doubts about whether the time is right. If you’ve taken the Quality of Life Questionnaire and are still unsure, we recommend consulting with your family veterinarian before scheduling an appointment.  
  
Rest assured, if you book an appointment, your in-home euthanasia veterinarian will let you know if they do not believe that euthanasia is appropriate at this time.

### How long will the procedure take?

You can expect your veterinarian to be in your home from 20-60 minutes, depending on how much of that time you need or want throughout the process.

### How does in-home pet euthanasia work?

In-home pet euthanasia with CodaPet’s network of veterinarians provides loving, end-of-life care when you need it most. Once you schedule a visit online, you will receive a confirmation, and your vet will make sure everything is arranged with care and clarity.

When your vet arrives, they’ll begin with a gentle assessment to reassure you of your decision and answer any questions you may have. Your vet will always move at your pace, giving you the time and space you need to say goodbye in your own way.

When you are ready, your vet will gently administer a sedative so your pet can relax and drift into a deep, peaceful sleep. After the sedation has fully taken effect, a final, humane medication is given, allowing for a calm and painless passing surrounded by love.

If you choose aftercare, your vet will respectfully care for your pet and transport them for cremation, handling every step with dignity and compassion.

### How much does in-home pet euthanasia cost in my area?

In-home euthanasia with CodaPet’s network of veterinarians in Alexandria and the surrounding areas begins at around $315. Your final cost may vary based on your pet’s size, your location, and any additional services you choose—such as private or communal cremation, ashes returned in an urn, or personalized keepsakes.

When [scheduling a vet visit](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment/) to your home, you’ll first receive a detailed, upfront price estimate according to your specific needs before confirming a visit. If you have questions or need support at any point, you can call (833) 263-2738.

### Are there vets providing in-home pet euthanasia services near me?

Yes. Dr. Megan Lowman, Dr. Derecka Alexander, and Dr. Lauren Silvesti serve families throughout Northern Virginia (NoVA). They serve Alexandria and Arlington, covering communities inside and outside the Beltway.

Their coverage also reaches south and west to serve Manassas, Gainesville, and Warrenton.

You can [use CodaPet.com](https://codapet.com/schedule-appointment) to determine which areas our local vets serve, view pricing, and see their availability. If your pet’s situation feels more time-sensitive, you can submit an [urgent appointment request ](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request)for immediate support.

### How do I tell if my pet is suffering?

Signs your pet may be suffering include chronic pain, difficulty breathing, loss of appetite, inability to stand or walk, or a loss of interest in daily activities. These symptoms could indicate a decline in their quality of life. You know your pet better than anyone, but speaking to a veterinarian can help you assess whether euthanasia is the most compassionate option. If you feel you need more help, you can read our guide on ‘[How will I know it’s time](https://www.codapet.com/how-will-i-know-when-its-time)’, take a [quality of life assessment](https://www.codapet.com/quality-of-life-scale), or call customer care at 833-263-2738.

### What should I do if my pet is declining fast?

If your pet's health is declining rapidly, it’s crucial to take the following steps:

  * **Consult Your Veterinarian:** Schedule an appointment to discuss your observations and any scoring from a quality-of-life scale. This information can help guide the conversation about your pet's condition and options moving forward. Your vet may suggest palliative care, hospice, or, if necessary, euthanasia.  

  * **Ensure Comfort:** Create a quiet, cozy space with soft bedding and easy access to food, water, and a litter box (if applicable).  

  * **Minimize Stress:** Keep routines simple and familiar, and limit loud noises or disruptions.  

  * **Offer Gentle Care:** Provide a soothing touch through gentle petting and offer favorite treats if they can still eat.  

  * **Consider At-Home Euthanasia:** If appropriate, discuss the option of at-home euthanasia with your vet for a peaceful and familiar passing.  

  * **Reach Out for Support:** It's okay to lean on loved ones, pet-loss support groups, or counselors to help navigate this difficult time.



If you're noticing signs of declining health, we encourage you to use our [quality of life scale ](https://www.codapet.com/quality-of-life-scale)assessment to evaluate your pet's condition before your vet visit.

### What is the difference between in home pet euthanasia and euthanasia at a vet clinic?

The key difference is the setting. At home euthanasia allows your pet to pass peacefully in the comfort of their familiar surroundings, reducing stress and anxiety. This option especially benefits pets who may feel scared or uncomfortable traveling to a clinic. It also offers your family a private, intimate experience during this emotional time. While some urgent situations don’t allow for time to schedule in-home euthanasia, many pet owners in Alexandria choose in-home services for the peaceful atmosphere and compassionate care their pets receive right where they feel safest. You can [find flexible availability](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment) for our local vets here, or look for [same-day euthanasia](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request) appointments.

### Will my pet experience any pain during euthanasia?

No, pet euthanasia at home is designed to be completely painless. After an initial end-of-life assessment, your veterinarian will first administer a sedative to ensure your pet is relaxed and comfortable. The euthanasia medication then gently stops the heart without causing pain. The process is peaceful and allows your pet to pass without distress.

### Do you provide 24-hour pet euthanasia services?

While we do not offer 24-hour pet euthanasia services, we do provide after-hours and emergency care in greater Alexandria. You can request [same-day and urgent appointments](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request) to ensure your pet receives the compassionate care they need during critical moments.

### Is there an additional fee for after-hours or emergency services?

Yes, there is typically an additional fee for after-hours or emergency appointments. You can view the estimate when you request a [same-day or urgent appointment](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request).

### Is the cost of euthanasia for dogs and cats the same?

Most providers in Alexandria charge a flat fee for euthanasia, although some providers do charge based on the size of your pet, so small dogs and cats can be the same price; however, medium or large-size dogs (such as Bulldogs, Australian Shepherds, Labradors, or German Shepherds) will likely carry a higher price. At CodaPet, most vets charge a flat fee for both dogs and cats; however, if there is a large pet fee, it will be applied automatically for you to review in the price estimate when you reserve an appointment. You can view the detailed [pricing and availability here](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment) or call us at (833) 263 - 2738.

### What should I expect during an in home pet euthanasia appointment?

During an in home euthanasia appointment, your veterinarian will make an assessment of your pet’s health and quality of life to provide guidance to ensure your decision is informed. The veterinarian will administer an initial sedative or anesthetic to help your pet relax and become pain-free, ensuring they are comfortable and at ease. In the last stage, your veterinarian will first ensure your pet is fully sedated before gently administering anesthesia which will quickly slow down your pet’s respiratory system until the heart finally stops beating. In most cases, this process takes less than a minute. Your veterinarian will always move at your pace so the process is as comfortable as possible for your pet and your family.

### How far in advance do I need to make an appointment?

The notice for every veterinarian differs, however, most veterinarians require at least a 2-hour notice from the time you need them to arrive at your home. This allows them time to prepare and ensure they can provide the highest level of care and compassion for your pet. It also accounts for their travel time, as your veterinarian may be traveling from many different locations around Alexandria.

While you can request a [same-day and emergency services](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request), it's always best to contact us as early as possible to ensure availability and to give both you and your veterinarian time to prepare for this important moment.

### What should I expect in terms of my pet’s behavior during the pet euthanasia process?

During the euthanasia process, your pet will be gently guided to a state of peace and comfort. After a sedative is administered, you can expect them to become calm and relaxed, free from any pain or distress. When the final injection is given, your pet will slowly drift off into a deep sleep before passing away peacefully. Your compassionate veterinarian will ensure the process is as gentle and serene as possible, allowing you to be present with your beloved companion in their final moments of love and care.

### Can I be with my pet during the euthanasia process?

Yes, during the in home euthanasia process, you are encouraged to be with your pet throughout the entire process. Being there provides comfort and reassurance to your pet as they pass peacefully.

### How do I know when it’s time to consider euthanasia for my pet?

Every pet is different, and you know yours better than anyone, however, it may be time to consider euthanasia when you notice more ‘bad days than good’. It’s important to keep an eye on your pet’s quality of life and try to understand when it has declined, such as no longer enjoying activities or suffering from unmanageable pain. To help you understand their quality of life, you take a [Quality of Life Assessment](https://www.codapet.com/quality-of-life-scale), which helps you get a more clear picture of your pet’s well-being at this point in time.

Remember, if you are unsure, speaking with your primary care veterinarian can help better understand your pet’s quality of life. It’s important to speak with your primary care veterinarian if you haven’t yet to understand your pet’s health. If you do not have a primary care veterinarian, consider visiting an urgent care or emergency hospital in your area.

### How should I prepare my home for my pet’s euthanasia?

Everyone’s experience in saying goodbye to their beloved companion is different and very personal. It’s important to consider that you know your pet best. Some considerations, however, are choosing a comfortable space where your pet feels safe, sometimes their favorite spot in your home. Another consideration can be to gather any family members who wish to be present and feel free to bring your pet’s favorite blanket or toys, etc that make them feel comfortable. When your veterinarian arrives they will guide you through each step in the process and help you move at your pace to ensure the process is as peaceful as possible.

### How long does the euthanasia procedure typically take?

In home euthanasia procedures usually take about 10-15 minutes, however, the total time can vary depending on the pace you and your family prefer to move at and your pet’s comfort level. Your veterinarian will take the time necessary to ensure you feel you have enough time to be with your beloved pet while also ensuring your pet is calm and relaxed before proceeding. In some cases, this may take longer, especially if your pet is anxious or uncomfortable.

We understand that saying goodbye is a deeply emotional experience, and we encourage families to take as much time as they need during the process. Our goal is to create a peaceful and compassionate environment for both you and your pet.

### What should I do after the euthanasia procedure is completed?

After the euthanasia, you are welcome to spend as much time as you need with your pet to say goodbye. If you’ve chosen any cremation services to handle your pet’s body, your veterinarian will reconfirm your choices and gently transport your pet when you are ready. If you’ve chosen any keepsakes offered by the crematorium, like Claw Paw Prints, Ink nose prints, or other memorabilia, your veterinarian will reconfirm your choices before leaving your home. If you have any questions or want to change your mind about any of your choices, you can discuss your options with your veterinarian before they leave your home.

### What are my options for cremation?

After the i**n home euthanasia** procedure, your veterinarian will provide you with time to say goodbye to your pet. Once you're ready, they will re-confirm the preferred aftercare option that you choose when reserving your time with your veterinarian. In Alexandria you can select two types of cremation services:

  * **Individual Cremation (Ashes Returned):** An individual cremation is a process where your pet will be cremated separated with physical barriers in the chamber. This ensures the separation with other pets in the chamber so you may reunite with your pet’s ashes. Your pet’s ashes will be returned to you in an urn of your choice. If you choose an additional urn then your pet’s ashes will be returned in the urn of your choice.  

  * **Communal Cremation (No Ashes Returned):** A communal cremation is a process where your pet is cremated in a chamber with other pets. Once the process is complete, the crematorium will respectfully scatter your pet’s remains among other pets. It’s important to note, you pet’s ashes will not be returned to you.



Some of our veterinarians offer an additional option known as **Private Cremation (Ashes Returned)**. In this option, only your pet is in the cremation chamber, ensuring that the recovered ashes are solely your pet's. These ashes can be returned in an urn of your choice, with additional urn options available. To see if private cremation is available with your provider, please refer to our [booking page](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment).

**Note** : If you choose to leave your pet's body with your veterinarian, rest assured it will be handled with the utmost care, respect, and dignity. Your veterinarian will coordinate all aftercare arrangements as requested, allowing you to focus on yourself and your family after this difficult goodbye.

### How do I get my pet’s ashes back?

### Are there any low-cost or no-cost pet euthanasia solutions?

Saying goodbye to a beloved pet is never easy, and we understand that cost can be a concern for many pet parents. While we specialize in premium in-home euthanasia services, we also want to acknowledge that cost may be a concern. If you're looking for low-cost or no-cost pet euthanasia options in Alexandria, consider reaching out to the following:

  * **Local Animal Shelters & Humane Societies** – Many provide low-cost or donation-based euthanasia services, often with cremation options.  

  * **Low-Cost Veterinary Clinics & Nonprofits** – Some vet clinics and nonprofits offer reduced-cost euthanasia, sometimes supported by grants or donations.
    * **Kingstowne Cat Clinic5830 Kingstowne**  
Center Drive, Alexandria, VA 22315  
703-922-8228
    * **The Animal Welfare League of Alexandria  
** 4101 Eisenhower Ave, Alexandria, VA 22304  
703-746-4774  
info@alexandriaanimals.org  

  * **Animal Control Services** – In certain cases, local animal control agencies may offer euthanasia services for terminally ill or suffering pets at a lower cost.



**Note:** When considering a low-cost pet euthanasia option, it's important to call ahead to check availability, as some providers may require an appointment or have eligibility criteria, such as income-based assistance. Be sure to ask about additional costs, including cremation or aftercare services, which may not be included in the base price. Additionally, verify service details, as some options may have restrictions based on your pet’s size, health condition, or location.

While low-cost options are available, many pet parents choose in-home euthanasia to ensure a peaceful, stress-free farewell in the comfort of their home. If you're looking for a private, compassionate experience, we’re here to help.

> Dr. Lowman was so kind and caring. Having never met our dog Caesar, she treated him just like he was hers. She talked to him lovingly and to us with so much respect and support. Dr. Lowman allowed us to take the time we needed to say our 'sorrowful good-byes'. Dr. Lowman answered ALL of our in-depth questions regarding the entire procedure, and explained what she was doing when and what Caesar was experiencing at that time. Caesar was sleeping so peaceful and snoring. We love and miss our Caesar dearly. I whole-heartedly recommend Dr. Lowman. God Bless her!

> Charlie came to us back in 2013 from a friend in North Carolina. Since then, Charlie traveled the world with us until we settled in Virginia. By this time our little buddy was hanging on, but his body slowly started to fade until he was no longer able to move on his own. Sadly, when it came time to send our angle back to heaven, we turned to Coda Pet who sent us Dr. Lowman. I'll be honest... She is the definition of professionalism, courtesy, empathy, you name it. She was a godsend who was present in the moment, caring, and made the process feel seamless. There was no unnecessary conversation, no judgement, and she was very supportive of our decision given his condition. The entire process felt very genuine from the initial phone call to our interaction with Dr Lowman to picking up his remains. If I thought for a second that Charlie was going to somehow pull out of his condition, I never would have made the call, and they reenforced that sentiment. That if at any time we felt that this was the wrong decision we could pull out. So, all that to say I am so lucky to have had this experience made less tragic by the loving and caring and professional team at Coda Pet. We even got a handwritten card from Dr Lowman. I mean come on. They truly care about you, and it shows. ❤❤❤

> After making the difficult decision to help our elderly bulldog cross the rainbow bridge, we found CodaPet online, offering in-home euthanasia. Our dog was a large breed and could hardly walk, and I couldn’t bear the thought of transporting her to a cold clinic for her final moments with us. Dr. Michelli arrived at our home and was so kind and gentle with our sweet girl; she explained to us how things would work and gave us time to answer any questions. We were so thankful to be able to say our final goodbyes to our fur baby in the privacy of our home and with her in the comfort of her own bed. Our hearts are broken by the loss, but I couldn’t have wished for a better way to have gone about this experience. Thank you, Dr. M and CodaPet. 🙏🏻🌈

> Dr. Lowman was so comforting during our rainbow appointment for our dog Teddy. She was professional and friendly throughout the visit. I’ve been recommending Dr. Lowman and codapet to anyone considering their options. My family and I had a lot of closure and a big part of that is because of Dr. Lowman. Thank you again.

> Dr. Megan was EXACTLY what we needed on this difficult day. She was kind, compassionate, and allowed us to move through the process T our own pace. Before we sent Kisses (our senior cat) with her, she explained next steps clearly and patiently waited for any questions or concerns we had. She went above and beyond to make sure that we received Kisses ashes. Thank you so much, Megan. We are forever grateful for you and appreciate so much how you handled that moment for us.

> Thanks to Dr. Lowman for coming to our house at 9pm to allow our sweet boy to pass in peace. He was over 14 years old and his health rapidly declined within 48 hours. I cannot recommend a better more respectful way than to allow your fur family to pass in their own home with family by their side. Thanks again.

She was incredibly sweet, caring, and truly wonderful with our 8-year-old during what has been an exceptionally difficult time for us. We feel incredibly fortunate to have had her guidance and support. Words cannot fully capture how thankful we are for her compassion and expertise, which helped us navigate this journey.

> Dr Megan was so gentle and caring and understanding with my terminally ill cat, Echo. It was as beautiful and as peaceful a passing as I could have hoped for as I held him in his favorite spot by the fire in my arms. She was especially terrific with my other two pets, giving them space and time to approach and grieve. While we never want to lose a pet to cancer, Dr. Megan’s care at home was a gift. Thank you for your kind and gentle nature and the loving care with which you attend to the end of life. I highly recommend Dr. Megan and CodaPet services.

> Dr. Clark could not have been a more kind, compassionate and patient veterinarian. He’s also very experienced and made what I expected to be a traumatic experience (in home pet euthanasia) as peaceful as it could be and I will be forever grateful for that. I felt awful that I waited a day or two too long before making the decision, but having Dr. Clark be the one to help us was the right choice. We’ll now be taking our other dog to his practice for care.

From the moment she arrived, we felt respected—not only in our home, but throughout the entire process. I didn’t even realize in-home euthanasia was an option, and I can honestly say the experience was as peaceful and comforting as it could possibly be. Her compassion made an unbearable moment feel gentle and dignified. We will always be thankful.

> Using CodaPet was so easy; from searching for a vet near me to clear pricing. Once booked they remained in constant communication with me throughout the process, providing time updates, etc. Our family was matched with Dr.Kelsey Jones and I can not recommend her enough. She arrived promptly, listened to our concerns, examined our furbaby Ciddy and gave us ample time to grieve and make the final decision. At no moment did I feel pressured to rush. She gave us time to set up an area outside and spoke to us like a friend throughout the process, while treating all of us with respect and compassion. She even made a suggestion on how to allow our other dog to say goodbye (which I would never have thought of). It’s not an easy choice to let go of a beloved pet but i feel this was the best way to do it and highly recommend her services.

She quickly assessed our cat Ronnie and agreed it was time. She explained what she would do and what would happen. She was very gentle and kind with our pet. She arrived totally prepared and acted to calm Ronnie and make the visit as comforting as possible. We can’t say enough good things about her professionalism and kindness to our pet and my husband and me. It’s very clear she loves animals. We would highly recommend her to help your cat in Sanger, CA area.

> We had a sudden need for home pet euthanasia for our beloved little dog, Jellybean. None of our local vets offered the service timely, so we had to try an unknown. I found CodaPet online and there were appointments available. Dr. Gordon at CodaPet was wonderful. The whole process went smoothly. Communication was thorough. She was a little late, but kept us updated (because you can't rush these things). She said all the right things and comforted us in our decision. We are heartbroken, but at least this part will be a good memory. Our pup was at home, peaceful, and not stressed out by being at the vet. We pet him, cried, told stories, and he just fell asleep. People who provide this service are special people. We SO appreciated being home for his final day. We would not hesitate to recommend Dr. Gordon if you unfortunately need this service.

The gratitude i have for Dr. Alex and her service cannot be understated. I was very moved by the experience. My kitty had zero stress; i placed her on my lap while i sat on the bed. Dr. Alex was so gentle and kind. I cannot praise enough. Thank you so much.

> Dr Lowman euthanized my dog that I’ve had for over 14 years with such kindness and compassion. After I booked the appointment she contacted me to ask if I had any questions and helped talk me through my doubts. She went through a medical history to make sure I was making the right decision and helped me feel less guilty about it all. When she arrived, she was so calm and compassionate. My pet died peacefully in my arms and I couldn’t have imagined a better way for her to go. My heart is still broken but I’m so grateful for Dr Lowman for making the process easier.

> Dr. Lowman helped make a devastating time in our lives feel bearable. She was incredibly kind and sweet to us and our dog Charlie. She gave us time to say goodbye in a peaceful and loving way, the way our Charlie deserved. One thing that may seem small, but was very important to me in my grief, was that she told us when Charlie would be cremated, and when we could pick up his ashes. It was a comfort to have this information. We previously went through having to euthanize our dog at a vets office, and it’s odd some of the things that stick with you in your grief. One of those things for me was not knowing where my dog’s body was, or when or where she’d be cremated, and then waiting weeks for an undetermined date when her ashes would be shipped to our home. Dr. Lowman has a gift, she has a very special way with animals and people alike. We are so grateful that she was able to come to our home and help us say goodbye to Charlie.
