# Which Animals Does the Humane Society Euthanize?

[Codapet](/experts/codapet)

June 30, 2025

While the Humane Society aims to rescue, treat, and rehome animals, some are humanely euthanized due to severe illness, behavioral risks, or unmanageable suffering. Most shelters only make this decision as a last resort, focusing instead on rehabilitation, adoption, and prevention programs. Learn which animals are most at risk and how communities can help reduce euthanasia rates.

## **Key Takeaways**

  * Humane societies may euthanize animals with untreatable medical conditions, dangerous behavior, or severe trauma that impacts quality of life.
  * Unlike no-kill shelters, open-admission humane societies accept all animals, making difficult euthanasia decisions a last-resort necessity.
  * Most humane societies focus on reducing euthanasia rates through spay/neuter programs, rehabilitation, and adoption partnerships.



The Humane Society is widely known for rescuing and rehoming animals, but many people are surprised to learn that some animals in their care are euthanized. While this can be a painful and contentious subject, it’s essential to understand the context, criteria, and ethical standards underlying these decisions. This guide examines which animals are euthanized by humane societies, the reasons behind this practice, and the methods used to minimize this outcome.

## **Understanding the Role of the Humane Society**

Before diving into which animals may be euthanized, it’s crucial to understand the role that the Humane Society plays. Local humane societies, often affiliated with the National Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) but operating independently, are typically nonprofit organizations or shelters. They provide services such as:

  * Animal rescue and rehabilitation
  * Adoption services
  * Spay/neuter programs
  * Community Outreach
  * Veterinary care



Because they are open-admission shelters, many humane societies take in any animal that comes through their doors, regardless of age, health, or behavior.

## **Are Animals Euthanized at the Humane Society?**

Yes, some animals are euthanized at humane societies. However, this decision is never taken lightly. Euthanasia is a last resort when other options are not possible.

It’s also important to distinguish between “no-kill” shelters and “open-admission” shelters. Many humane societies are open-admission, meaning they accept all animals, even those who are terminally ill or dangerously aggressive. In contrast, no-kill shelters often turn away animals they cannot place or care for in the long term.

## **Common Reasons Animals May Be Euthanized**

Eligibility for euthanasia must follow clear guidelines dictated by the health, behavior, quality of life, and danger posed to the community.

Here are the most common reasons:

### **1\. Severe Medical Conditions**

Animals suffering from advanced illness, injury, or chronic pain may undergo euthanasia if their condition is untreatable or causes prolonged suffering. These might include:

  * Terminal cancer
  * Severe trauma (e.g., hit by a car)
  * Untreatable infections
  * Organ failure



Veterinary teams assess each case individually, often with second opinions, to ensure euthanasia is in the best interest of the animal.

### **2\. Dangerous or Aggressive Behavior**

Animals that pose a significant threat to humans or other animals and cannot be safely rehabilitated may be euthanized. This is more common with:

  * Dogs exhibiting severe, unprovoked aggression
  * Animals with a history of biting or attacking
  * Behavioral conditions stemming from prolonged neglect or abuse



While behavioral specialists often work with these animals, not all cases are salvageable, especially when public safety is at risk.

### **3\. Severe Neglect or Irreversible Psychological Trauma**

Animals that have experienced prolonged neglect, hoarding situations, or abuse may develop psychological issues such as extreme fear, anxiety, or aggression. If these behaviors are irreversible and cause suffering or render the animal unadoptable, humane euthanasia may be considered.

### **4\. Overcrowding (Rare in Modern Shelters)**

In the past, high intake and low resources meant shelters were euthanized for space. Today, most humane societies emphasize low euthanasia rates and focus on proactive measures like:

  * Foster programs
  * Partnerships with rescue groups
  * Community adoptions
  * Transfer to no-kill facilities



However, in extreme cases—particularly during emergencies or natural disasters—overcrowding may still influence decisions.

## **Which Animals Are Most Often Euthanized?**

While all species are considered, certain groups are more vulnerable to euthanasia due to health or behavior issues.

### **1\. Senior Pets**

Older dogs and cats often enter shelters with chronic medical issues, decreased mobility, or age-related cognitive decline. If these issues impact their quality of life and can't be managed, humane euthanasia may be the kindest option.

### **2\. Severely Ill or Injured Strays**

Stray animals found in poor condition—especially those who have been hit by vehicles or suffering from starvation—may arrive at the shelter beyond the point of recovery.

### **3\. Aggressive Dogs**

While the majority of dogs in shelters are friendly and adoptable, some display unpredictable or aggressive behavior. If professional training fails to improve their temperament, euthanasia might be necessary.

### **4\. Small Animals with Health Issues**

Rabbits, guinea pigs, birds, and other small pets are also at risk when they arrive with untreatable illnesses or injuries, particularly if they have special needs that exceed the shelter's capabilities.

## **What the Humane Society Does to Prevent Euthanasia**

The goal of most humane societies is to reduce and eventually eliminate the need for euthanasia of healthy or treatable animals. Here’s how they work toward that mission:

  * Spay and neuter programs to reduce overpopulation
  * Behavioral rehabilitation and training
  * Medical treatment and foster care for sick animals
  * Adoption drives and outreach programs
  * Working with rescue partners and no-kill groups



Many organizations also track and publish their live release rates—the percentage of animals that leave the shelter alive—giving the public transparency.

### **Profiles in Humane Treatment: Chicago’s Anti-Cruelty Society**

One well-known example of a shelter committed to compassionate care is **The Anti-Cruelty Society in Chicago**.

As one of the oldest and largest animal welfare organizations in the Midwest, The Anti-Cruelty Society operates as an open-admission shelter, accepting every animal brought through its doors, regardless of health, temperament, or age. While their mission is to find homes for every adoptable pet, they also provide critical services, including veterinary care, behavior training, foster support, and humane education.

In cases where an animal is suffering or poses a significant risk to others, the organization follows ethical and medically guided euthanasia protocols. Their approach balances compassion with responsibility, always striving to reduce the need for euthanasia through proactive community programs and rehabilitation efforts.

## **How You Can Help**

Community support plays a major role in reducing euthanasia rates. Here's how you can make a difference:

  * **Adopt, don’t shop** – Giving a shelter pet a home opens space for others.
  * **Foster animals** – Short-term fostering can save lives by reducing crowding.
  * **Donate to local humane societies** – Your funds help cover medical care and training.
  * **Volunteer your time** – Help with daily care, enrichment, or community education.
  * **Spay and neuter your pets** – Prevent unplanned litters and shelter overflow.



## **A Difficult but Necessary Decision**

So, which animals does the Humane Society euthanize? Typically, those who are suffering beyond help pose a danger to others or face quality-of-life issues that cannot be improved. While the term "euthanasia" often carries a stigma, in the shelter world, it's an act of compassion—one made only when no other humane options remain.

The vast majority of animals in humane societies are treated with care and compassion, rehabilitated, and rehomed. Euthanasia is always a last resort, not a default choice.
