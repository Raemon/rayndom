## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

While working in companion animal ER and general practice, some of the most generous ways I experienced the strength of the human animal bond was through humane euthanasias.

> Dr. Anne Szczotka was amazing during the hardest time in our life. We had to make the hard decision to put our dog down. My wife wanted to have their last moments be private and in a place where our dog felt the most comfortable, at home. Anne was so compassionate. She reached out a few days before and asked if we had questions. When she was here, she let us know everything she was doing, what would happen next and how everything worked. She asked questions to get to know Alaki, our dog more. We received a card in the mail from her a couple weeks after and she had remembered things about Alaki we told her. Such a small thing that meant so much! She was wonderful and if we have to go through this horrible thing again, I hope she’s by our side again!

> Dr. Anne was amazing. We had to unexpectedly let our almost 12 year old lab cross the rainbow bridge. She was available the next day, provided such excellent communication, was compassionate throughout the entire process, and allowed us all the time we needed. I am so thankful we were able to have the services provided in our home and would 10/10 recommend Dr. Anne to anyone considering the gift of at home euthanasia for their beloved pet.

> Dr. Anne was very compassionate and efficient to make the passing of our Bruno as peaceful as could be at home. I would strongly recommend her. The reduced stress and anxiety on us and Bruno was very real. To have had to try to load him in the car (he was 90 pounds and stubborn) and take him to the vet (one of his least favorite places) would have made this more traumatic than it was. Truly appreciate their service in an at-home passing.
