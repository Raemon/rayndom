# Why veterinarians should consider becoming a freelancer

Freelancing as a veterinarian can offer unique benefits and advantages. Freelance veterinary work can include a variety of different jobs from relief at a day practice or emergency clinic to opportunities in education such as teaching in vocational colleges or medical writing. Here are some of the benefits to using your veterinary degree as a freelancer:

## **Freelancing Benefits**

### **1\. Flexibility and Autonomy**

Freelancers have the freedom to work on their own terms, choosing the projects they want to take on and setting their own schedules. This flexibility allows them to better balance their work and personal life, leading to increased job satisfaction and overall happiness.

### **2\. Increased Earnings Potential**

Freelancers have the potential to earn more money than they might in a traditional employee position. This is because relief vets can charge higher hourly or per diem rates and negotiate project fees based on their experience and expertise.

### **3\. Diverse Skill Development**

Freelancers often work on a variety of projects, which exposes them to different industries, technologies, and problem-solving techniques. This diverse experience helps them develop a broad range of skills that can be applied across various domains.

### **4\. Working Environment**

Freelancers have the ability to create their ideal working environment. They can choose to work from home, in a co-working space, or even while traveling. When acting as a relief veterinarian, they can also specify the type of appointments they wish to see such as surgeries versus wellness. This flexibility allows them to find a working environment that suits their needs and preferences, leading to increased productivity and job satisfaction.

Freelancing vets looking for additional opportunities may be interested in adding in-home euthanasia services to their schedule. Offering in-home pet euthanasia is a great way to enjoy the benefits of freelancing while significantly benefiting the families served.

## **Benefits Of In-Home Pet Euthanasia**

### **1\. Compassionate Care**

In-home pet euthanasia veterinarians provide compassionate end-of-life care for animals in the comfort of their own homes. This allows pets to pass away surrounded by their loved ones, including other four legged family members, which can be a comforting experience for both the patient and their family.

### **2\. Reduced Stress for Pets**

Any vet visit can be a stressful experience for pets, particularly when it takes place in an unfamiliar environment such as a veterinary clinic. By providing in-home services, veterinarians can minimize stress for the animal and create a more peaceful and comfortable environment.

### **3\. Convenience for Pet Owners**

In-home pet euthanasia services offer convenience for pet owners who may have mobility issues, limited transportation options, or simply prefer to have their loved one pass away in a familiar and private environment. This allows families to focus on saying their goodbyes without having to worry about logistical challenges and navigating through a public setting.

### **4\. A Personalized Goodbye**

In-home pet euthanasias can be tailored to the individual personality of the pet and their family. When at home, families are able to set the ambiance for the goodbye that best honors their pet, including music, a favorite couch or bed, prayers or other rituals, candles, and forbidden sweets. In-home euthanasia ensures that the pet’s final moments are as comfortable, dignified, and authentically personal as possible.
