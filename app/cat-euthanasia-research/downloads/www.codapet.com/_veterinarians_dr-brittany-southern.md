Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I enjoy discovering new ways to help animals and people. Throughout my career, I have had the privilege of caring for healthy, ill, and injured animals, and have realized the significance of palliative and end-of-life care. My gentle and empathic spirit has drawn me to support families during these difficult seasons. I believe that in-home euthanasia is a unique gift that we can provide to help families say goodbye to their special friend in their favorite place.

> Dr. Southern’s patience, kindness and compassion made one of the hardest days of our lives a bit more bearable. She walked us through the entire process, gave us all of the time we needed, and offered a safe space to grieve the loss of our boy, Roscoe. Everything went seamlessly and allowed him to spend his last moments comfortable, in his home and with his family. I couldn’t have asked for a better way to say goodbye. Thank you Dr. Southern ❤️

> Dr. Brittany exceeded all expectations I had in terms of emotional support and compassion. She let me take as many moments, big or small, as I needed before proceeding with any steps and never made me feel like I was asking for too much. I could not have asked for a better experience. I could not thank her enough. I will forever be grateful and appreciative of her service and empathy for me and my beloved Shmitty. It is an understatement to say, thank you Dr. Brittany.
