Sometimes a beloved pet will pass away before the scheduled euthanasia appointment. Though this can be a challenging situation to face during your loss, we are here to support you through the process of arranging compassionate and dignified care for your beloved pet.

## Here are some steps you can take:

### Cover and Protect

  * If your pet has passed away, cover them with a light sheet or blanket to protect them from the elements, especially if it's warm outside. Ensure they are shielded from direct sunlight. If needed, you may safely relocate your pet.



### Contact CodaPet Care Team

  * If your veterinarian has not yet reached out to you to confirm the appointment, please call 1 (833) CodaPet 1-(833-263-2738). The care team will alert your veterinarian, and you can still arrange for your CodaPet veterinarian to pick up your pet and carry out your wishes for cremation, as previously elected. Your invoice total will be adjusted accordingly. Depending on your veterinarian's schedule, they may be able to assist you before the initially scheduled appointment time.



### Timeline for Pickup

  * Your pet should be okay for pickup up to 8 hours after passing. However, it's important to note that it is normal for a pet's body to begin stiffening within 30 minutes to 2 hours after passing.



### Self-Handling Aftercare

  * If you wish to handle your pet's aftercare yourself, please inform the care team or your veterinarian that you wish to cancel the 'euthanasia appointment.' You may alternatively let your veterinarian know you wish to cancel your appointment as well as click the ‘cancel’ link in your CodaPet correspondence email or text.



We understand the sensitivity of this situation and are here to assist you with any questions or concerns you may have. Please take your time, and feel free to reach out for support during this difficult time.
