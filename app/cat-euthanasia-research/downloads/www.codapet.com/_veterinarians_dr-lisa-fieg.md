Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

My motivation to offer in-home pet euthanasia comes from a deeply personal experience and a profound understanding of the bond between pets and their families. When I was a child, my family dog, Missy, was diagnosed with diabetes. Helping care for her during her illness was a pivotal moment for me, shaping my passion for veterinary medicine and deepening my empathy for both pets and their owners. Providing in-home euthanasia allows me to support families in a setting that is both intimate and comforting. From my experience, I’ve seen how much more peaceful and dignified it can be for pets to pass away at home, surrounded by their loved ones and in a familiar environment. This approach honors the special bond between pets and their families, offering a compassionate farewell in a way that truly respects their journey together.

## What pet parents are saying

> Losing our little man was always going to be the hardest and most painful part of having him our lives. But, if there was one thing that could make the experience any easier on both our pup and our family, it was having Dr. Lisa Fieg there to guide the way. She truly and absolutely cares. You can feel it from the she arrives. Saying goodbye to Arlo in the comfort and quiet of our home was so special. While we would do anything to have him back, we're so relieved to know that we did the best for him and feel so blessed to have had Dr. Lisa there with us. Thank you so much.

> Making the decision to say goodbye to your pet is one of the most difficult things a person can do. Dr. Fieg was so kind and empathetic and helped me feel confident I made the correct choice for my dog. Using this service to have it done in my home made the whole thing so peaceful for my pup, I’m so grateful it was able to be done in that way. I highly recommend the service and I highly recommend Dr. Fieg.

> A few sentences of the experiences of the CodaPet services would be completely out of context and not give a true representation of what we were feeling. Our dog loved to give boops, steal shoes when he cam inside, take walks, protect and defend us from attacking dogs, and suck his dinner down faster than a speeding SR-71 Blackbird. Then he got cancer that metastasized to his lungs , and we tried to keep him happy to enjoy all those things. We did radiation, chemo, and drug cocktails to kept him alive and happy for months after the diagnosis, months longer than he had originally been expected to live. The pain got worse, we tried another round of radiation, which worked for a few weeks, but then he got fussy over food. We would change to other tasty things for him to eat, which worked at first for a few days, then would work only for one meal, then he wouldn't eat. Because the cancer was in his leg he would hobble outside, clearly in pain, but kept his head up, laying on the grass, watching the world go by, still being a dog. He got so thin. One never knows the best time to do the euthanasia. If too soon, one feels they're depriving the dog of being a dog and enjoying life. Too late and the dog is just miserable and can't really be a dog any more. We may have had one or two more days before our boopy-boy couldn't be a dog any more, but there was no point in dragging out his agony any more. This was no longer about what we wanted, it had to be about what was best for him. Dr. Lisa from CodaPet was empathetic, caring, and knew how to make everyone comfortable, including the dog. He barked at the stranger in the house, always wanting to protect us, even if he couldn't even stand up. She showed us how to keep him calm and rest and not be aware when she gave him the sedative. He finally relaxed, the pain washing away, finally at peace at home on his own bed before she gave him the final injections. Dr. Lisa wrapped him in a blanket and we carried him to her car and we put him in the back, with some nice flowers arranged almost like it was in a funeral home. She gave us each a hug, acknowledging her job was not easy, and we pushed the button to close the tailgate, giving us our last view of our Boopy-boy, asleep, finally out of pain, leaving us with memories of a great doggie life and finally the end of a long struggle to keep him as happy as we could.

> Deciding to let our sweet cat, Toby, go was the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life. But it was clear his cancer was beating him, and there was nothing more we could do for him. We couldn't stand to see him suffer. I called "Codapet". The person I spoke with on the phone was so kind and considerate. She took all of my information, and thankfully, Dr. Lisa Fieg was able to come to our home that afternoon. She was very calm and gentle with our Toby. She explained the procedure well and made sure we didn't have any questions. We sincerely appreciated the time she gave us to hold him during the process. She even stepped out of the room, allowing us to be with him alone, after he passed. Everything went very smoothly and took about an hour. I had a friend who put her dog to sleep at home. She kept telling me it was a "beautiful experience!" I'm not going to lie. It wasn't "beautiful" to me. There was no way around it being anything other than a gut-wrenching experience. We were losing something we loved dearly! I cried so hard, I could barely see! I would have given an arm and a leg not to have needed to make that call that day! But, it had to be done. For that reason, this company, Codapet, and Dr. Lisa were a Godsend. I would highly recommend them to anyone facing an end-of-life decision for their pet. Everyone we came in contact with was sincere, respectful, beyond caring, and professional. Everything was timely and efficient, but never felt rushed or robotic. That day, 4/21/25, was our worst nightmare, but Codapet and Dr. Fieg made it the best that it could be. She got us through it and gave our sweet boy the comfortable release he needed, while he was held by two people who loved and adored him. For that, we are eternally grateful.

> We were referred to Dr. Lisa Fieg from CodaPet to perform euthanasia on our beloved golden Oliver. She was very aware of our pain and did everything she could to make it easy for us to endure it. She explained the entire procedure and confirmed that Oliver, based on her experience, was indeed in pain. She made us feel at ease, and to accept the fact that it was the best for him. The process was smooth and tranquil to everyone. It is always sad to say goodbye to a loved pet, but Dr. Fieg made it a little less painful. If anyone is in a situation like ours with a beloved pet, Dr. Fieg/CodaPet will help you through the process of saying goodbye.

> Honestly, I don’t normally leave reviews but the experience we had with Dr. Lisa and an at home euthanasia was truly phenomenal. Whilst it was such a sad and heartbreaking time for us, being in the comfort of our own home and having our sweet dog Freud’s last moments be in his familiar surroundings with a vet that truly cared and was so kind, was extremely special. Like most pet owners we were battling with whether we had made the right decision, but Dr. Lisa took one look at Freud and said it definitely was the right time. He immediately went up to her and seemed extremely comfortable in her presence. It also seemed as though he knew what she was there for. We went with Freud out to our back garden. It was a beautiful sunny day and the sun was shining down on all of us. Freud was so calm and at ease. He rested his head on my husband’s lap we said our goodbyes and he gently drifted off for the last time. I feel so grateful for Dr. Lisa and the wonderful service Codapet gives for families going through this upsetting time. If you are wondering whether it is worth it or it makes a difference, I wholeheartedly say it does. My father was a vet, and I grew up taking my pets to the clinics and hospitals- but this experience was different. Thank you to Dr Lisa for making this a unique transition. We miss our boy, but feel grateful we got to say goodbye in this way.

> We couldn’t have had a more understanding compassionate Veterinarian than Dr. Lisa Fieg from CodaPet to handle our in home pet euthanasia. The stress of having to put down what we all considered a member of the family was just heartbreaking. Dr. Lisa prepared us and explained what she was going to do and gave more than ample time to be with and say farewell to our handsome little boy Joey (Ragdoll) cat. She treated the entire visit with the utmost compasion, respect and patience, allowing us time to prepare ourselves and never making us feel rushed. I can't recommend Dr Lisa enough for how she got us through this necessary event. It was all gentle, peaceful and looked painless. When a situation like this comes up, you don't know who to call or who to ask for, call CodaPet. I have already told a few friends and family members about our experience with Dr Lisa.

Dr. Lisa has a soft, calming voice and gentle touch, she made him (and us) feel comfortable. Her car inside was made up so pretty with a basket and flowers to send our beautiful boy away.......

> Dr. Lisa Fieg is an amazing, sensitive, highly skilled vet. She spent time learning about Angel, my 16 year old beloved mini poodle. She considered how to ease his transition by encouraging consumption of his favorite food (hard-boiled egg yolks) as she administered an injection to relax him. He was so thrilled to be indulged in 4 yolks that he gobbled them up, didn’t notice the injection, and immediately fell asleep with a gentle snore. She helped me pick the perfect urn for him—it was beautifully wrapped and it even comes with a tiny key for the heart lock. It was delivered with compassion by a kind driver who kept me closely informed of his arrival. I’m so grateful for Dr. Lisa. She’s truly the best, most loving person with whom to share such a painful loss. ❤️🥲🙏🏻

We didn’t have to travel, we didn’t have to worry if Porky was in pain. We didn’t have to worry about her remains. Everything was handled with love and dignity. I thought of it was a very spiritual ceremony. Porky was a feral cat we convinced to become our pet and she was inside and outside the house. We felt that for what we paid we got peace of mind.

> Having my pet euthanized due to a diagnosis of stage 4 lymphoma cancer at 7 years 11 months was something I wasn’t ready for. My dog was so young and taken away from me too soon. Dr. Fieg was the best. She was very thorough and explain explaining the entire process and gave me as much time as I needed to be with my dog until his demise. My dog went very peacefully and is no longer in pain. It was very comforting to me seeing the process and being there for my dog till the end. I did everything I could for my dog and the cancer was just too much for him. Although I miss him on a minute to minute basis, I know that he is in a better place now. I would highly recommend.Dr. Fieg if and when it comes time to make that decision that you never thought you had to make. Thank you Dr. Fieg for being so thorough and respectful to my dog and my wishes.

> In the darkest hour for my father’s beloved companion, a Labradoodle named Joey, Dr. Lisa came to the rescue. Joey’s condition had been worsening for several months, and my aged father was no longer able to provide the necessary care for Joey. Joey’s health had declined sharply in recent months, and it had become clear that his quality of life had dropped so far that it was time to find someone to administer the final act of love for him. When we contacted Dr. Lisa we knew from the first phone call with her that we had reached a compassionate and caring doctor. On her arrival we found her to be empathetic and deeply caring in her treatment of Joey; she also took the time to make a compassionate connection with my father. Dr. Lisa brought out a thick blanket and some pillows to make Joey as comfortable as she possibly could, and with loving words and gentle touch, she helped him on his final journey. Joey’s pain was at an end, and the loving hands of the doctor did all that was possible to ease his transition out of this world. I really can’t say enough about how wonderful Dr. Lisa was; she was extremely competent, professional in the extreme, and still managed to make herself a part of our family for the time she was with us. Mingled with my father’s sadness over losing his beloved companion were some tears of gladness, for the tender and gentle treatment administered by Dr. Lisa Fieg.

> We suddenly found ourselves in an unbearable situation with our 17-year-old dog, Teddy. His health declined so quickly, and we had to rush to find someone who could help us say goodbye at home. Thankfully, we were able to book an appointment with Dr. Lisa. She came to our house with such humility, patience, and compassion. She listened as we cried and asked a million questions, gently reassuring us that we were doing the right thing for our sweet boy. She never rushed us, she gave us the space and time we needed to say goodbye. As heartbreaking as it was, Teddy passed peacefully and comfortably in our arms. Dr. Lisa treated him with love, dignity, and respect, and made sure he was safely transported for cremation. She even followed up with us afterward to reassure us he had arrived where he needed to go. Losing Teddy has been one of the hardest things we’ve ever gone through, but we have no regrets choosing Dr. Lisa. She gave our boy the most loving, gentle passing we could have hoped for.

> Dr. Lisa Fieg took the time to immediately call me and discuss my pet's case when I made an urgent request online. She was willing to quickly drive to see us, but ultimately I needed to wait for my wife to come home from work, and we used another service who could come in the evening. I appreciated her informative and compassionate consultation, and it helped me get through a very hard day.

> Dr. Fieg was exactly the person we needed on such a sad day. She was extremely respectful and a calming presence throughout the whole process. She explained everything beforehand, even took the time to sit with us and our fur baby before she even got started. Our gal took a turn for the worst very suddenly but Dr. Fieg gave us all the time we needed to process and say goodbye. When it was time, she walked us through each step before she administered anything. It was hard to say goodbye but our baby crossed the rainbow bridge very peacefully. The entire situation was painful and heartbreaking but we can’t thank Dr. Fieg enough for creating a calm environment and making the process as smooth as possible for everyone.

> She was very understanding and helpful with what we had to do after his death and where we had to take his body to verify that he did not have rabies even though he had all of his shots.Cisco was very comfortable cuddling with me with his head on my leg. She came from behind the couch, so he was not even aware of her, to give his shots.

> Dr. Lisa was very caring and kind. Her compassion and comfort made losing our Dodger a peaceful process. She took time with us and patiently waited until we were as ready as we could be to let him go. Her car was even decorated in the back where he was transported. Thank you Dr. Lisa

> Losing a pet is never easy, especially for a young child. A year after being diagnosed with cancer, we finally made the hard decision to lay our fur baby Hachi, down to rest. Dr.Lisa Fieg was exceptional. She was kind and patient. Our German shepherd had never taken to strangers very easily, but he welcomed Dr.Lisa into our home with love and lots of kisses. It was as if they had been best friends all along. Dr.Lisa was very thorough in walking us through the process with a kind heart. I couldn’t have asked for a better way to lay my pup to rest. He never looked uncomfortable. In fact, it was the most at peace I had seen him in a long time. I am forever grateful to Dr.Lisa for making the most unpleasant situation as pleasantly possible under the given circumstances. Dr.Lisa was very thoughtful with every detail of the process. My 80 year old grandmother wanted to give our shepherd a kiss good bye , but couldn’t get to her knees , and Dr.Lisa suggested that she wait until we get him loaded into the truck so that he would be at her level. When we arrived at Dr.Lisa’s car, we were pleasantly surprised to see how she had decorated the back of her SUV. It was as if he was in a funeral home. She had decorated with flowers, it didn’t look like we were just throwing our pup into someone’s trunk. This is just one example of her thoughtfulness. We were all a mess of emotion and lacked mental clarity, Dr.Lisa’s helpful suggestions to our ever need was irreplaceable. Thank you Dr.Lisa from the bottom our hearts to yours for everything you were for our family today. ♥️

> Having to say goodbye to my old girl Ripley was so heartbreaking and I could not have asked for a better person than Dr. Lisa Fieg to help me through it. She was so kind, caring, and understanding. Being in our home, surrounded by so many people who loved Ripley, and with Dr. Fieg's calming presence made this solemn occasion a very peaceful and memorable one. Thank you Dr. Fieg!

> I cannot express enough the gratitude I feel for Dr. Lisa Feig. It was heart wrenching knowing I had to say goodbye to my precious Dottie before she began to suffer. We loved her so much. With that said, Dr. Lisa Feig made the experience so much easier and peaceful for our sweet girl. I knew Dottie was not in pain and crossed over in the most peaceful way. Dr. Feig is the most compassionate, caring, thoughtful doctor anyone could ask for. Anyone who has Dr. Feig in their life as wife, mother, daughter, friend--is an extremely lucky person. She was so giving of her time and patience. I recommend at home euthanasia to everyone. Having your loved one home, comfortable in their surroundings is really the best option. I hated the idea of her being at a hospital or vet clinic in a sterile environment. I got to hold her and tell her how pretty she was and how loved she was. And all the while, Dr. Feig demonstrated such genuine compassion. My fiancé and I were blown away. It takes a special person to do this type of job. And Dr. Lisa Feig more than meets that requirement. A million thanks to her and Coda Pet.

> This was one of the hardest decisions I have ever had to make in my whole life. But, as painful as it was, I am so very glad that I went with CodaPet to help me send my baby girl over the Rainbow bridge. As the pet parent of an 18 year old cat, I had started to think about whether or not I wanted to do something like this about a year ago and I leaned more and more toward this option because I wanted my baby to go in her own home, surrounded by love and safety. I looked up options and something kept drawing me to CodaPet. I saw that they had a solid 5 star reviews and I can definitely see why. Dr Lisa Fieg was such an absolute comfort. She had such a phenomenal bedside manner and I couldnt have asked for a better suited person for the moment. She helped me get through the hardest day of my life and I couldnt be more grateful. I dont wish this type of moment on my worst enemy, but if you are faced with the decision and are on the fence, please just know that it will be the best decision you've ever made. It is with infinite love and gratitude that I thank Dr Fieg and CodaPet for allowing me to have my last moments with my baby at home.

> Lisa was perfect in every way, I 💯 recommend her. She made the worst day a little bit easier and was so compassionate. She let me spend as much time as I needed with him before and after, and I can’t even describe how special those moments were for me. On another note, making an appointment was just clicking a time. She showed up on time and kept in full contact with me. I initially tried this with a very popular company in Los Angeles and they caused me so much grief… never calling back, claiming to be 24/7 as I watched my boy spend his last night in unnecessary pain… so do your pet a favor and use Lisa/Codapet.

> Dr Fieg made a difficult decision for our family easier. She couldn’t have been any more kind. We were so glad we contacted her instead of just taking our dog to the veterinary hospital. She gave us all a big hug before she left our home. She was amazing.

> Dr. Lisa Fieg was very accommodating and compassionate while providing in-home euthanasia services for my rapidly declining Basset Hound. She came out the same night after hearing that my dog was experiencing seizures. I highly recommend her for anytime one has to euthanize their pet and wants to have it done at home.

> Dr. Lisa Fieg is such a kind and empathetic doctor. She was exactly what we hoped for. My boy Chester was able to be sent to heaven in his own room with his family. It was so peaceful. She took the time for myself and his brothers to say goodbye. She wrapped him in blankets and laid him in a basket to take him to the cremation place. It makes all the difference being able to do it at home instead of driving to the scary vet office and taken in a back room with unfamiliar people. It is SO WORTH THE MONEY to have her help you. She was able to accommodate the time we wanted and arrived on time. We have had sad experiences at the vets office in the past. I will only use her for my babies from now on. We are lucky to have her available to serve my city. Rare find. Highly recommend!

> Dr. Fieg was sensitive, caring, unrushed and kind. Tiger went into a deep sleep before his leg was shaved and the catheter inserted for the final step. He spent his last moments with his family on his spot on the sofa. Worth the extra dollars to have everything done right. Sad but perfect.

> I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Dr. Lisa Fieg for the compassionate care she provided when helping our senior dog, Mochi, cross the rainbow bridge. Dr. Fieg was not only professional but also incredibly courteous and respectful throughout the entire process. She took the time to understand our grief and allowed us the space to say our final goodbyes to Mochi without feeling rushed. Her gentle and empathetic approach helped us navigate a very difficult moment with comfort and dignity. We are truly thankful for her support during such an emotional time.
