Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

In general practice, I always gravitated toward end of life care for pets and their families as she felt it was important to provide a peaceful experience for pets and their parents. I believe that in-home euthanasia creates a calm and comforting environment for pets and their families as they say goodbye to their life-long companions.

> I cannot thank Dr. Amanda Harper enough for the care and compassion she provided during one of the most difficult times for our family. She came to our home to help us say goodbye to our beloved dog, Chester, after 13 wonderful years together. Her professionalism, empathy, and gentle approach brought us comfort during an incredibly emotional time. She made sure Chester was at peace in his final moments, surrounded by the people who loved him most. We are forever grateful for her kindness and the care she provided. I highly recommend her to anyone who wants their pet to be treated with the utmost respect and compassion.

I sympathized with her difficult duties with clients she had never met and never been to their home. She handled it all beautifully.

> A Gentle Goodbye with Dr. Amanda Harper Saying goodbye to a beloved pet is one of the hardest things a family can face, and when our sweet cat Trixie reached the end of her journey, we were blessed to have Dr. Amanda Harper by our side. From the moment she walked into the room, Amanda brought a sense of calm, compassion, and grace that made an unbearable moment feel just a little more bearable. She treated Trixie not just as a patient, but as a cherished soul — speaking to her gently, stroking her fur, and making sure every step of the process was handled with dignity and love. Amanda answered our questions with patience, gave us space to grieve, and never rushed us. Her empathy was palpable, and her professionalism was matched only by her kindness. Trixie crossed the rainbow bridge peacefully, surrounded by love, and with Amanda’s gentle guidance, we felt supported every step of the way. We will forever be grateful for the care she gave — not just to Trixie, but to us as well. If you’re ever in need of a veterinarian who truly understands the depth of the human-animal bond, Dr. Amanda Harper is that rare and extraordinary soul.

> I would recommend Dr Harper and her services to anyone dealing with the tough decision of having to let a pet go. She was so kind and gentle with our dog and made the process as good as an extremely difficult day can be. From her arrival to when she left with our departed dog, she treated Scout as if she were her own. We were extremely greatful for the service and care she provided not only to our dog, but to my wife and I as well.

> Giving up our sweet dog Jasmine of almost 15 years was heartwrenching. Of course we also did not want to see her miserable and suffering. So glad we found Dr Amanda Harper. She came to our home and made this all go very smoothly. Jasmine went to sleep laying across our lap as we showered her with hugs, kisses, praises and prayer. She went peacefully. For such an incredibly difficult thing to do… Dr Harper made all the difference. She even had a doggy gurney and helped me carry Jasmine to the burial spot in my back yard. So glad we did not take her to the vet for this. Thank you Dr Harper! God Bless, George Davis

> I am very glad that we had Coda Pet and especially Dr. Amanda Harper handle my in-home pet euthanasia. Dr. Harper was very kind, sweet, and patient during the entire thing and she made the process much more comfortable. It was a very sad and difficult day putting down my 18 year old poodle who was blind, and I’ve never had to put a pet down before. The respect and care that Dr. Harper showed made things feel not as scary. She answered any questions we had and showed my sweet dog so much love the whole time. I highly recommend this company.

> I think God knew I needed someone as caring and understanding as Dr. Harper to help me through my ginger’s passing so when Dr. Harper came it was truly a blessing to have her be with us. It was just me and Ginger at home together and Dr. Harper brought so much warmth and love that I didn’t feel as scared and alone as I did before. I was feeling so guilty for making this choice and she helped me through a lot of those emotions. I didn’t know what to expect about this process and she was so good to me and good to ginger. I’m forever thankful Dr. Harper was the one who knocked on my door when it was time for me to say goodbye to my best friend.

She handled Ace with ease and such care as if he was her family. What touched me most was when she prayed over him. I have told all my family and friends about my experience. I would recommend Dr Harper and CODA to anyone in the situation of having to emphasize a family pet.

> This past month has been extremely hard on our entire household but I am very grateful for Dr. Harper for making it as comfortable as possible for our baby. She is ridiculously sweet and caring and even shows love towards others pets to make them comfortable too. This is the first time I have ever gone through losing a pet and it was very hard for me and my husband and she even comforted us while also comforting our dogs before starting. It never seemed rushed or super uncomfortable which is how I imagine a vet would be. I hate that I met Dr. Harper under these circumstances but also very happy that she was there and helped all of us say goodbye to our best friend.

> The loss of Dallas was more than the passing of a beloved pet. He was my best friend, fierce protector and loyal companion. We had been through a lot together - break up of a long-term relationship, moving from Florida to Tennessee, the loss of employment, new employment and our health issues. Dallas was only 7, but he had terminal cancer. He was courageously fighting the disease, but his body was becoming weak. Dr. Harper was incredible - I don't think she even knows how amazing she is! She helped us get through the worst day in my life. She considered Dallas' needs and devised a plan, so we would not have to muzzle him (as we did at the vet). She wanted to give him a peaceful passing. She did not treat Dallas like a dog, but a beloved family member. I am so thankful that she was the one who came to our home. She was amazing and I will forever be grateful to her! She used such care in the way she wrapped Dallas up in a blanket and let us send him off with his favorite lamb toy, even though it was equal to the size of him (Dallas was a sixty-pound, blue American bully). She let us have as much time as we needed to say goodbye to him and handled him (& me) with the upmost care and compassion. She even called us the night before to see how Dallas was doing and gave me a few ideas to help him through the night. I will forever be grateful to Dr. Harper & CODA Pet for their caring treatment of my best friend at such an awful time. Their care and compassion will not be forgotten. Thank you, Dr. Harper for being such an amazing person and making it possible for us to send Dallas peacefully off with love. You are an incredibly special person.

> We cannot thank Dr. Harper enough for the kindness, compassion, and comfort she provided during one of the most difficult moments of our lives. God truly sent us an angel in her. Saying goodbye to our beloved Aspen was heartbreaking, but Dr. Harper made the experience as peaceful and gentle as possible. Her explanation of every step was clear and reassuring, helping us understand what to expect while allowing us the space to process our emotions. The care and tenderness she showed toward Aspen—and toward us—was beyond what we could have hoped for. She treated Aspen with such dignity and love, making sure her final moments were filled with peace and comfort. We are forever grateful for Dr. Harper’s empathy and professionalism. In such a painful time, she was a source of warmth and guidance, and we truly cannot recommend her enough to anyone facing this incredibly difficult decision.

> My family and I felt our precious Holly Bell was given the very best care until her last sweet breath. She was gently cared for and caressed by all of us that loved her most. Dr. Amanda was very soft spoken and knew how fragile we all were. She took her time and explained everything to us all. Holly Bell was relaxed and passed very peacefully. She was handled with dignity throughout the entire process even after her death. We chose cremation and received her beautiful urn and paw print the next day and even got a call from them expressing condolences and saying Holly Bell sure looked very royal. She was our queen and I’m so glad she was treated as such by everyone. Our grief is present but we are also comforted knowing our fur baby is at peace and not in pain.

> How do you say goodbye to one of the most beautiful and gentle companions to ever grace our home? The decision was wrenching, but our sweet Sassy was telling us it was time. An angel was sent to us at one of the most emotional and confusing times of our lives. That angel was Dr. Amanda Harper. We knew Sassy (and me and my wife) were in the hands of a compassionate, caring and loving professional. Dr. Harper knew in her heart the difficulty of us having to say goodbye to our beloved Sassy, and her calming and patient support gave us a quiet in our hearts as our ailing Sassy gently left us. Dr. Amanda Harper is truly an angel.

> We recently had to make the heartbreaking decision to say goodbye to our beloved cat, Dexter, after years of joy and companionship. In our darkest moment, Dr. Amanda Harper from CodaPet came to our home and guided us through the process with unparalleled professionalism and emotional support. From the moment she arrived, her calm presence and genuine empathy helped my wife and me feel seen and held, even as grief overwhelmed us. What truly set this experience apart was the peace it brought Dexter—no stressful drive to the vet, just the quiet comfort of his favorite bed surrounded by the people who loved him most. Dr. Harper ensured the procedure was as gentle and dignified as possible, allowing him to pass without pain or fear. Her attention to every detail didn't stop there; she thoughtfully collected his remains in a beautiful blanket and basket, then personally delivered him to the crematorium for us, sparing us one more layer of burden on an already impossible day. CodaPet's in-home service isn't just convenient—it's a profound act of kindness that honors the bond we share with our pets. If you're facing this choice, I can't recommend Dr. Harper and CodaPet highly enough. They turned an unbearable farewell into something as sacred and serene as it could be. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts—Dexter's peaceful goodbye is a gift we'll forever be grateful for.

> My 14 year old car, Spirit, had heart failure and she was always fearful of strangers. I knew that if I put her in a crate, to the car and started to drive, she would go into heart failure and die on the way and I could not stand that being her last memory. Dr. Harper came to my house and from the time I met her in the front yard, she was so kind and had a peaceful and kind presence. She made such a sad experience more peaceful for myself as well as Spirit. I got to hold Spirit in my arms until her last breath. I want to thank Dr. Harper for her kindness and loving approach to helping the animals as well as the humans in the way she showed her love of other beings on this planet.
