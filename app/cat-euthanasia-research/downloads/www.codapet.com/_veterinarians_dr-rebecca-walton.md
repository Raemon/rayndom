## What pet parents are saying

> Rebecca was amazing to work with, we really appreciate her care and understanding of the hard times we were going through. She was professional and at the same time compassionate, both my partner and I are so happy for her services. Also she went above and beyond to send us a little card which we thought it was super thoughtful of her. We really are truly thankful for all she did for us.

> Dr Rebecca Walton went above and beyond my expectations of what it would be like to put my dog down, from the start she was so compassionate, caring, sympathetic, knowledgeable and understanding. The whole experience left me speechless at how peaceful it was. I am so grateful I was led to her on that most difficult day, I couldn’t have hand picked a better vet to do the hard job if I tried. The delivery of my dog’s ashes was equally as beautiful and meaningful. Forever grateful.

> Dr. Becca and her assistant, Morgan, were more than I could have asked for on the hardest day of my life. She intuively knew the best way to ways communicate with us in our profound grief, and they were incredibly respectful and gentle despite my rather terse communication at the time. I never wish anyone to have to go through this, but if you do, I can't recommend Dr. Becca enough.

> Dr. Becca was exactly who my family needed when it came time to say goodbye to our sweet rescue boy. Because our pup was particular with who he allowed near him, we needed someone with very calm and gentle energy and Dr. Becca was very much that person. Having to say goodbye is always hard, but Dr. Becca and her assistant made an excruciating time, less so. My family highly recommends Dr. Becca when your family decides the time has come.

> Words cannot describe how comforting and kind Dr. Becca and her assistant Morgan were during the process. However I will do my best. My family's situation with our family dog was difficult which led us to the deciding to let him rest. He had grown very old, sick, and was in poor condition. It was embarrassing. I explained the situation to Dr. Becca, asking to please do not judge us and our dogs state. Her communication and assurance that she held no judgement made the experience less painful. We were her last appointment during the night, but she and Morgan showed up with positive and compassionate energy. Holding such soothing demeanor, they conversed with us, explained each step, and kept strong composure as we grieved his last breath. They took him away with such consideration, it made my family and I feeling light knowing we did the right thing and that he is in good hands with them. Then their visit to bring our dog back to us was endearing as they brought flowers, a written card, his paw print, and his ashes. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts, Dr. Becca and Morgan! The experience would have been unbearable without you.

> So glad I went this route with Dr. Rebecca and her assistant. They came to the rescue at the perfect time when I couldn't find help for my dog's transition to heaven. They made the experience so pleasant for me and my family that I wouldn't have it any other way. They truly made me feel I made the best decision when having to say goodbye to my baby girl. Thanks to them I feel at peace.

> Dr. Walton and her assistant were incredible. They came to our home the same day we called and showed such kindness and compassion during a very difficult time. Our beloved Tank was suffering, and their gentle care made the transition easier for our family. A few days later, they even sent us a heartfelt sympathy card, which truly extended their warmth and support. We are so grateful for the compassion and professionalism they provided.

> Dr. Becca and her assistant Morgan were so kind and professional. This was the 1st time we helped a pet cross the rainbow so we didn't know what to expect but really needed to help our dog ease his way. Dr. Becca explained the process in a kind and gentle manner, it helped to feel their experienced knowledge. They addressed our dog in a personal manner and noted his cute special features, it was like talking to another pet owner. We were able to share anecdotes of our dog which made it feel like we were celebrating his beautiful life. They gave us plenty of private time to be with him before he was eased through the process. I felt like our dog was in the best hands when Dr. Becca swaddled our dog in a blanket and carried him away for cremation. After a beautiful life with us, Dr. Becca & Morgan's kindness and experience helped our 15+ yr. old dog Jimmy's life come in full circle. They came back in a week with the beautiful urn we chose with Jimmy's name engraved on it, and the paw print that was unexpectedly meaningful to me. They were so kind to bring flowers to honor Jimmy and saved us locks of his fur that I requested, after forgetting to clip some myself. I highly recommend Dr. Becca and Morgan to anyone in this difficult time. I am so grateful and feel at ease for how Jimmy crossed his rainbow. Thank You.

> Dr. Walton and her assistant Morgan were the most compassionate, respectful, and sympathetic professionals when it came to putting my dog down. They both intuitively knew what to say, what to do, and I appreciated their gentle presence, kindness, and communication beyond words. This was my first time having to part ways with a pet, and it was one of the worst experiences of my life. However, even in my profound grief, there was a moment during the process I thought of how beautifully tragic this was. If it has to happen, this is the most peaceful and poetic way to do it. Zoey took her last breath just how she wanted - in my arms, surrounded by the people and things she loved most, in the comfort of her own home. Dr. Walton and Morgan, I hope to never see you for your services again… but if I or someone else does, I cannot recommend them enough. Thank you for making an extremely difficult process a little easier

> Best dog, best friend - my fluff of life. Saying goodbye was one of the hardest things I have ever done. My heart still aches as I see my baby in the shadows. Dr. Rebecca Walton was wonderful. She made sure Cody was comfortable using a sedative. She put him to sleep while I held him. And when I was ready, she helped me to let him go. She was kind, supportive and compassionate. And while I never want to see her again, if I ever need to do this again I will be searching for her. Coda Pet provided a wonderful service. Being at home for our last goodbye with a compassionate doctor and assistant meant everything. Thank you.
