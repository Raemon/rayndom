Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

A family friend once told me that pets are all “little heartbreaks waiting to happen.” Obviously, pets are much, much more than that, but he was right! It will break our hearts when they leave us. I feel that if I can make that heartbreak even just a little bit easier by providing peaceful, smooth transitions for pets in their homes with their loved ones, I would be honored to do so.

> We contacted CodaPet when the time came for our beloved greyhound. Scheduling was very simple and clear. Dr Kellie Ayle came to our home to assist. She was extremely professional and provided a very warm and personal environment at such a sad and emotional time for us. In addition, follow up and delivery of ashes was quick and with care. We would encourage you to consider at home euthanasia and using CodaPet/Dr. Kellie was a welcomed assist for us.

> Dr. Ayle provided the most compassionate and gentle care during a very tough time. As an on-demand vet who comes to your home, she made saying goodbye to my beloved dog as peaceful and thoughtful as possible. Her kindness, patience, and genuine concern for both my pet and us was incredibly comforting. I am so grateful for her support and highly recommend her to anyone needing at-home veterinary care. Some things that gave me real assurance: -She observed my dog for around 20 mins before agreeing that euthanizing was the best decision. -She talked us through the process and was very articulate as the process progressed. -She gave us time and did not rush, making the whole experience special and at our pace. -She carried the dog out in a sweet little basket with blankets, providing our baby dignity and us peace of mind that the transport was dignified. If I have to do this process again, I will only use Dr Kellie Ayle.

> Dr. Kellie is who you will want during this time. I researched and read many reviews at different companies, and I couldn't have asked for a more loving, compassionate Dr. to help me in sending my Roxy girl to Heaven. She reviewed all the meds and paperwork of the steps I'd taken and confirmed we had done everything we could, it was time. She allowed me to have my precious last moments, and she was so tender with my baby during the process. She communicated the steps, what I can expect, even her voice was as gentle as an Angel. I will forever use Dr. Kellie.

> November 10, 2024, at approximately 5:15pm, I lost the best cat ever. I rescued a female kitten (2008) that was dumped and in a box. Just went through a divorce (22yrs) and truly feel she was sent to me to not only comfort me, but to give me something to live for. We have been inseparable since. I've had plenty of animals, but there was something about Misty. From day one, she always wanted to go outside. So, one day, I put a harness on her w/leash and at least twice a week we'd go walking around the block. She started to get sick back in April 2024. Even though she was about 15 yrs old, she was always a fighter and wanting to go outside. Finally, I had to decide to put her asleep. It was one of the most difficult decisions in my life. I didn't want to, but knew it was best for her. My neighbor two weeks prior had to put her senior dog down. She called CodaPet, Dr. Kellie Ayle. My neighbor stated Dr. Kellie Ayle was the best and she was right. I wanted Misty to pass at home outside, not a veterinarian office. I called CodaPet, Dr. Kellie Ayle and set up an appointment. Dr. Kellie Ayle came out and my neighbor was right, Dr. Kellie Ayle was the best. Dr. Kellie Ayle was very caring and extremely compassionate. Even though I miss Misty so much, don't think I could have picked a better Dr. to ensure Misty passed knowing she was loved and was in loving arms.

> When we knew it was time for our dear furbaby, Belle, to be out of her suffering, we knew we didn’t want the experience to be at our vet’s office. We chose in-home pet euthanasia with CodaPet so Belle could be comfortable in her final moments and we could have a little more time with her. Dr.Kellie was kind, responsive, and walked us through the entire process without rush. Losing Belle was not easy but it was certainly easier with the aid of CodaPet. If you are having to make the same tough decision we had to, we highly recommend CodaPet to assist your family.

> We first lost our Frenchie to a brain tumor, then a few months later, our Pomeranian's hip dysplasia got to painful for him to walk. We loved the option of in home euthanasia, so our little guys could be on their favorite bed, surrounded by our love. Dr. Ayle was kind and patient. She really made the experience the best it could be. Our little guys went to sleep peacefully. Losing your little guys is very painful, but if you have to, CodaPet is definitely the way to go.

> "Dr Kellie was calm and kind and very respectful to us and our sweet dog, when in my house. She explained the process and what we could expect. The best part was, she brought a baggy of yummy dog treats for us to give our dog while we waited the few minutes for the 1st med to take effect. Our sweet girl perked up and loved every bit of it plus it was a great distraction for us. Thank you Kellie

> Dr Kellie was so compassionate and caring in my dog’s last moments. My final goodbye with him was able to be a peaceful and calm moment in my own home in his own bed that he loved. She thoroughly explained the whole process ahead of time so that I knew exactly what was gonna happen so I could be sure to be able to give my sweet little pug Butters the goodbye I wanted to give him. Afterwards she was so gentle and respectful of him and gave me plenty of time with him before taking him away. She let me know when his ashes were ready and even delivered them to me. It’s a heartbreaking thing to have to say goodbye to your best friend of 17 years and I am very thankful for the compassion of vets like her.

> My wife and I were pretty apprehensive about the process of give our 15-year old dog relief from his suffering; Dr. Ayle immediately put us at ease and, more importantly, was caring and very gentle with him. It couldn't have been more peaceful and we would highly recommend her to you if you are in this situation.
