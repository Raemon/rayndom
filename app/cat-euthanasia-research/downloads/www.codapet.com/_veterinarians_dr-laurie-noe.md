Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

From the time I could pronounce the word, I wanted to be a veterinarian (around 5 years old) and I never wavered from that goal. I have been a veterinarian for over 35 years and still love every minute of my profession. I never felt being a veterinarian was a career choice, but rather a calling. I have strived to provide the best care possible for my patients, with special attention to reducing their pain and suffering. To this end, I have many years providing home euthanasia for family pets. I have always felt profoundly honored to be chosen by a family to help their beloved pet pass from their suffering to a place where they are free. To do so in the comfort of their own home (or other special place) is so much more dignified and intimate for the patient and their family.

> Doctor No was very compassionate and sympathetic to the situation. She talked me through the process and was very gentle and kind. She also sent a note afterwards, expressing her sympathy on the loss of the dog. This was an unusual situation since my nephew and niece was not available during the last moments she was kind enough to take a paw print so that they would have a memory. I relayed all this to them and they were very happy with her service

> As my family liked to describe Dr. Laurie & her assistant, they were like angels. The way they both made my family feel comfortable & prepare for our handsome Limbo to go to Dog heaven, made this experience worth it. My family appreciate her so much for being patience w/ us & showing so much care & love within the process. We’re thankful that you were able to be available even at night time, which made it possible for more of my family to be available to come through. Thank you again Dr. Laurie! Especially for everything you’ve done for our dear Limbo!

> Dr. Noe helped put our 20 year old cat to rest. When we put our two other pets to sleep they were awful experiences due to the veterinary offices and their actions. Our cat and dog were mishandled and panicked. She explained the process well, made us feel comfortable during an awful time and made Smokie comfortable until her last breath. Home euthanasia is recommended to those parents that don't want to give their babies the added stress of a car ride and a vet office.

> Thank you Dr. Laurie Noe for making Little's last moment with us peaceful. It's our first time losing our fur baby, we weren't sure if we were making the right decision or even what to do for our Little. Dr. Noe made us feel comfortable throughout the process while getting all the necessary steps done. Also gave us extra time saying last goodbye.

> Dr. Laurie Noe and her colleague were extremely compassionate, knowledgeable and kind professionals. The entire family was truly impressed with Dr. Noe's bed side manner. She came out the same day I needed her services (weekend). She and her colleague had tremendous compassion for the process and educated themselves on our situation prior to arrival. Dr. Noe listened and gave advice accordingly. She made me feel better about my extremely difficult decision. I highly recommend Codapet and Dr. Laurie Noe during a difficult time like this. I also received a card in the mail afterwards. 5 Stars!

> Dr. Noe had a very calm and kind disposition. She understood our grief and helped us feel comfortable while saying goodbye to our 16 year old dog. Euthanasia at home was absolutely the best gift we gave our dog - she was able to peacefully pass while being with family, in her own bed, in her own loving home, and even with our cat staying close by. Our dog had no stress during the process whatsoever, just relief. Thank you Dr. Noe.

> We would like to thank Dr. Noe for her generous support and kindness helping us take care of our sweet boy Cosmo. Cosmo took a sudden turn for the worse at not quite 18 years old and we were faced with making a decision we knew was best for him, even though our hearts were breaking. Dr. Noe was able to arrange her schedule very quickly and confirmed a time for us. When she arrived, she confirmed Cosmo's condition was as we thought, making it comforting to us we were making the right choice for him. She was so gentle and made sure he was comfortable and gave us time to spend with him before and after he passed. We will be forever grateful to her.

> When we had another cat put to sleep in a hospital it was very clinical. Garfield had an IV and was drugged. This time Dr. Noe made it a very peaceful passing. We were with her the entire time and she was able to be at home until the end. This is the best way for a pet to pass.

> Putting our sweet girl down was heartbreaking but Dr. Laura Noe and Ezra made all the difference in the world. They were compassionate, gentle and caring every step of the way. They petted and greeted Sienna warmly,… like they were old friends. Sienna was happy and loved their attention & was at ease in their presence. Simply put, they were Wonderful. Thank you both for your gentleness and compassion‼️ Our girl is at peace and no longer in pain. Dr. Noe & Ezra, we are Thankful for you. More than you know 💕.

> As a vet I understand how difficult and awkward euthanasias can be for the vet and staff, but the Dr. made several off color jokes during the process and failed to read the room. My husband and I were suffering immensely and she was joking/loudly talking with our dogs. She was very kind and I know if she was told about this she would be more cognizant in the future.

Our cat and dog were mishandled and panicked. She explained the process well, made us feel comfortable during an awful time and made Smokie comfortable until her last breath.

Home euthanasia is highly recommended to those parents that don't want to give their babies the added stress of a car ride and a vet office. The price was very reasonable compared to going to the vet the last time we put down our loved one.

> I thought Dr Noe was professional but a I also felt rushed in a way. Once Onyx had passed she had almost left hurriedly out the door, not allowing me ample time with Onyx. But I did express I do want more time before she leaves. She was understanding and left to her car to take her medical bags and came back. I helped her to her car and she gave me more time at her car.

> In the context of grieving that had already started before Dr. Laurie Noe's arrival, she proactively offered contact for questions, and she confirmed and sent reminders for the appointment date/time, and arrival. We were grateful that she was available to come with one day's notice for a Sunday appointment. Dr. Noe arrived with her very kind assistant, Ezra, and she gently explained everything. With Dr. Noe's guidance, the process of sending our beloved Mulan to doggie heaven was incredibly smooth, patient, empathetic, and comforting. We remain very appreciative of Dr. Noe's and Ezra's gentle efficiency and kindness.

She explained what was happening in such a beautiful way to our children and helped them create keepsake memories. She was quick to respond to my same day request, kept in communication, and made the whole process seamless which was greatly appreciated.

> Thank goodness for Dr. Noe. We weren't aware of all of our options to help us with our suffering dog. We found that in-home euthanasia is the best option, by far. Think about how stressful is would be for a dog, that doesn't even want to be moved, to go to a vet office. CodaPet is who we chose and Dr. Noe was very comforting and made us and our dog feel at ease from start to finish. I should add that she was in no rush and gladly took the time for us to say our goodbyes. I highly recommend CodaPet and Dr. Noe. Thanks again!

> Dr. Noe kindly shepherded us through the most difficult day. It was time to let our dear, sweet little Bailey go. Dr. Noe came exactly on time, met our little doggy and explained to us how we would proceed. She allowed us to hold Bailey as she gave him a sedative. To demonstrate how calm he was she shaved a bit of hair off one paw to make a footprint. After he was very sleepy, she gave him the injection. A few moments later she announced he had earned his wings. To be able to say goodbye to our beloved doggy, at home, with his family around him, under his comfy blanket, was truly a blessing.

They answered my boys' questions and really cared about our feelings toward transitioning our cat toward his "forever sleep." I am grateful for their assistance and guidance through the process.
