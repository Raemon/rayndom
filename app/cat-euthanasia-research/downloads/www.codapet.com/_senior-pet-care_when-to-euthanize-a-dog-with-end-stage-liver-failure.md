September 26, 2023

End-stage liver failure causes grueling symptoms that might impact the pet’s quality of life. Learn when is the right time to euthanize a dog with liver failure here.

## **Key Takeaways**

  * Liver disease in dogs can develop silently, showing few symptoms until significant damage has occurred.
  * Caring for a dog with liver disease requires a mix of veterinary treatment, dietary adjustments, and at-home support.
  * Understanding the stages of liver disease in dogs can help pet owners provide the best possible care and improve their dogs’ quality of life.



Caring for a dog with liver disease requires a well-rounded approach that includes veterinary care, dietary adjustments, medications, and lifestyle changes to support liver function. Understanding the different stages of the disease helps pet owners recognize warning signs and make informed decisions about treatment. In advanced cases, when pain and quality of life become major concerns, discussing euthanasia with a veterinarian may be the most compassionate choice to prevent unnecessary suffering.

To learn more about the stages of liver disease in dogs, how to manage symptoms, and when to consider difficult decisions, read on for expert advice and compassionate guidance.

## **What Causes Liver Failure In Dogs**

Liver disease in dogs can develop due to a variety of factors, including genetics, infections, toxins, and poor diet. Certain breeds, such as Doberman Pinschers and Labrador Retrievers, are genetically predisposed to liver conditions like copper storage disease. Bacterial or viral infections, such as leptospirosis or hepatitis, can also cause inflammation and long-term liver damage. Exposure to toxins, including certain medications, poisonous plants, or household chemicals, may lead to acute or chronic liver failure.

Poor nutrition and obesity can contribute to liver dysfunction by increasing fat accumulation and straining the organ’s ability to process nutrients. Additionally, aging and underlying conditions like cancer or endocrine disorders can weaken liver function over time. Because liver disease often progresses silently, early detection through routine checkups and bloodwork is essential. With proactive care, including a proper diet and veterinary treatment, many dogs can maintain a good quality of life despite liver disease.

## **Symptoms of Liver Failure in Dogs**

Signs of liver failure in dogs can vary, but some of the most common symptoms include jaundice, which causes the skin and eyes to turn yellow due to a buildup of bilirubin. Affected dogs may also experience a significant loss of appetite, leading to weight loss and dehydration. Increased thirst and frequent urination often occur as the liver struggles to regulate fluid balance properly.

As the disease progresses, dogs typically become lethargic and weak, making it difficult for them to move or stand. Vomiting and diarrhea are also common, as the liver is unable to process toxins and nutrients efficiently. In more severe cases, dogs may exhibit neurological symptoms such as confusion, disorientation, or even seizures, resulting from the accumulation of toxins in the brain. Early detection and veterinary intervention are crucial in managing liver failure and improving quality of life.

## **What Are The Stages of Liver Failure?**

Understanding the stages of liver failure is essential for recognizing how the disease progresses and determining the best course of action for your dog's care. Below, we explore the four stages of liver failure, from early symptoms to end-stage complications, to help you better manage your pet’s condition.

### **Stage 1 (Initial or Early Stage)**

Stage 1 of liver disease in dogs is often subtle, with few or no noticeable symptoms. At this stage, liver function may be slightly impaired, but the dog typically appears healthy. Mild signs, such as slight lethargy or a decrease in appetite, may be present, though they are often mistaken for normal aging or temporary issues. Blood tests may reveal elevated liver enzymes, indicating early liver stress, but the disease has not yet caused significant damage to the organ.

### **Stage 2 (Moderate Stage)**

Stage 2 of liver disease in dogs is characterized by more noticeable symptoms as liver function continues to decline. At this stage, dogs may experience increased lethargy, loss of appetite, weight loss, frequent urination, and excessive thirst. Jaundice, or a yellowing of the skin and eyes, may begin to appear as the liver becomes less effective at processing toxins. Blood tests show more significant enzyme elevations, signaling ongoing liver damage that requires veterinary intervention to prevent further complications.

### **Stage 3 (Severe Stage)**

Stage 3 of liver disease in dogs is marked by severe liver dysfunction, with noticeable and concerning symptoms. Dogs may experience significant jaundice, abdominal swelling due to fluid buildup (ascites), and noticeable weakness or inability to stand. Neurological symptoms, such as confusion, seizures, or disorientation, can also develop as toxins accumulate in the brain. Blood tests confirm advanced liver damage, and immediate veterinary care is required to manage symptoms and slow the progression of the disease.

Once it sets in, early signs of liver failure can include prolonged vomiting and diarrhea. Later on, however, symptoms might include:

  * Yellowing of the eyes, skin, and gums
  * Severe fatigue or loss of movement
  * Pronounced diarrhea and/or vomiting
  * Lack of appetite
  * Weight loss
  * Increased drinking and urination
  * Seizures
  * Confusion and disorientation



### **Stage 4 (End-Stage or Terminal Stage)**

Stage 4 of liver disease in dogs is the end-stage, where liver function is critically compromised, and the dog’s health rapidly deteriorates. At this point, dogs may experience severe jaundice, uncontrollable bleeding, and a total loss of appetite, along with extreme lethargy and weakness. Neurological decline becomes more pronounced, with symptoms like seizures, confusion, and coma. Blood tests show profound liver failure, and without immediate intervention, euthanasia may be considered to prevent unnecessary suffering.

## **When To Euthanize a Dog With End-Stage Liver Failure**

Early and middle-stage liver disease in dogs can be managed with the right treatments, and your dog may still enjoy a good quality of life. When the disease has progressed to the third stage, and your dog’s symptoms are no longer manageable, your veterinarian will likely suggest relieving suffering with euthanasia.

Knowing when it’s the right time to say goodbye is hard. This can be further complicated when the disease has progressed for some time and changes in quality of life are gradual. None of us wants to feel like we’ve said goodbye to a beloved pet too early, nor have we waited too long. This tension can often feel like a tightrope walk.

### **Your Dog’s Diagnosis and Quality of Life**

The severity of your dog’s illness plays a critical role in the decision to consider euthanasia. If your dog is in constant pain, unable to eat, or struggling to move, their quality of life may be significantly compromised. In cases where the liver failure is advanced and irreversible, even with medical intervention, euthanasia may be the most compassionate option to prevent further suffering.

It’s easy to lose sight of changes in quality of life when taking care of a dog with a chronic disease. One tool that can help you is our [quality of life assessment](https://www.codapet.com/quality-of-life-scale), which objectively measures your pet’s quality of life. The questionnaire enables you to assess your pet's overall comfort and happiness. It includes questions about your dog’s eating and drinking habits, signs of pain, and participation in daily activities.

### **The Owner’s Financial and Mental Health**

The financial strain of ongoing treatments can be a significant factor in the decision to euthanize a dog, especially when the cost of care becomes unsustainable. In addition, the mental and emotional toll on the owner, as they witness their pet’s suffering or decline, may make the decision to let go even more challenging. The inability to manage both the emotional burden and financial costs of extended veterinary care can lead some owners to make the heartbreaking choice to euthanize.

### **Your Vet’s Medical Opinion**

The veterinarian’s opinion can significantly influence the decision to euthanize a dog, as they can provide a professional assessment of the dog’s condition and prognosis. A vet may offer insights into whether the dog’s pain is manageable and if any treatments could improve their quality of life. In some cases, the vet may suggest euthanasia if they believe the dog is suffering and there are no viable treatment options left. Having an open and honest conversation with the vet can help guide the owner through the difficult decision, ensuring it’s made with the pet's best interests in mind.

## **When In-Home Euthanasia Is The Better Option**

Dogs enrich our lives in ways we can’t repay. However, when liver disease progresses to the point where suffering can no longer be alleviated, euthanasia is not only warranted but the kindest choice.

### **What factors influence the decision to euthanize a dog with liver failure?**

The severity of the disease, the dog’s quality of life, and the effectiveness of available treatments are key factors in making this decision.

### **Can financial concerns affect the decision to euthanize a dog?**

Yes, the cost of ongoing treatments and the emotional strain of care may influence the choice to euthanize.
