Some of the most common cancers include [mast cell tumors](/senior-pet-care/what-are-mast-cell-tumors-in-dogs) and [lymphoma in dogs](/senior-pet-care/what-is-lymphoma-in-dogs). In cats, recognizing early symptoms of [feline cancer](/senior-pet-care/understanding-cancer-in-cats-an-overview) can help pet parents make informed decisions about care.

### Simple Changes to Support Your Senior Pet

A few adjustments to your pet’s environment can significantly improve their comfort:
