Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

Becoming a veterinarian has been a lifelong goal since I was a young kid. I have worked in the veterinary field since I was 14 years old, first as a kennel assistant and worked my way up. I became a licensed veterinary technician in 2016 and was accepted into veterinary school in 2017. I have always been drawn to helping animals in need and providing a voice for them. Now as an emergency veterinarian, I have seen firsthand how difficult, stressful, and overwhelming the end of life decision can be for our furry friends in an in-clinic setting. I believe that in home euthanasia can provide healing and comfort to families as well as our pets. I have been fortunate enough to be able to provide the compassion and comfort needed for families during the most difficult time in their lives and know how much a peaceful passing at home can make all the difference for everyone involved. I aim to continue to support families during this difficult time with empathy and compassion.
