Saying goodbye to a beloved pet is never easy, but having a compassionate and experienced veterinarian by your side can make all the difference. Dr. Jason Doolittle, a seasoned emergency and critical care veterinarian, has brought his unique expertise to Fort Worth families by providing gentle, in-home pet euthanasia services through CodaPet. His journey from the high-pressure emergency room to the calm comfort of home reflects a deep commitment to supporting pets and their people during life’s most difficult moments.

## **A Career Built on Saving Lives and Providing Comfort**

Dr. Doolittle earned his Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from Ross University and completed extensive clinical training, including an internship in emergency and critical care. For nearly a decade, he worked in general practice and emergency veterinary medicine, where he faced the intense challenges of treating critical and life-threatening conditions.

While emergency medicine focuses on saving lives, Dr. Doolittle recognized that part of veterinary care also means helping pets pass peacefully when their time comes. This realization led him to specialize in in-home euthanasia, where he now offers families a dignified, compassionate alternative to traditional clinic settings.

“Transitioning from the emergency room to in-home euthanasia has allowed me to use my medical knowledge in a profoundly different way,” Dr. Doolittle explains. “I’m able to provide calm, personalized care in an environment where pets feel safe and loved.”

## **Serving a Diverse Community in Fort Worth**

Fort Worth is a vibrant city with a rich mix of urban and suburban pet owners who value their animals as family members. Dr. Doolittle’s background in emergency medicine equips him to handle a wide range of cases, ensuring that every pet receives expert, individualized care.

By offering euthanasia services at home, Dr. Doolittle helps reduce the stress pets and families often experience at a veterinary clinic. This approach allows pets to spend their final moments surrounded by familiar sights, smells, and loved ones—a comforting option for many families.

## **Compassionate Care at Home: What to Expect**

CodaPet and Dr. Doolittle provide a seamless experience from scheduling to aftercare. When you reach out, you’ll be connected directly with Dr. Doolittle to discuss your pet’s condition and make arrangements for a home visit at a time convenient for your family.

During the visit, Dr. Doolittle conducts a thorough consultation, answers your questions, and ensures you feel supported throughout the process. He administers medication to gently and painlessly help your pet pass, providing the care and dignity every animal deserves.

## **Understanding CodaPet Pricing in Fort Worth**

CodaPet strives to make in-home euthanasia accessible and transparent. Pricing in Fort Worth typically starts around **$400 to $650** , depending on factors such as:

  * Pet size and species (dog or cat)
  * Additional services requested (such as sedation or aftercare options)
  * Travel distance or scheduling specifics



This all-inclusive price covers the veterinarian visit, euthanasia procedure, and follow-up support. Families can also choose from a variety of compassionate aftercare services, including cremation or memorial options, offered separately through CodaPet.

## **Providing Peace When It Matters Most**

Dr. Jason Doolittle’s unique journey from emergency medicine to in-home euthanasia reflects a heartfelt dedication to compassionate veterinary care. For families in Fort Worth facing the difficult decision of saying goodbye, his calm expertise and gentle presence provide comfort and peace.

If you’re considering in-home euthanasia for your beloved pet, Dr. Doolittle and CodaPet are here to support you every step of the way.
