If you’re a pet parent in New Orleans seeking a veterinarian who blends deep-rooted experience with heartfelt compassion, look no further than Dr. Jeffrey Perret. With over 34 years of veterinary practice, Dr. Perret has become a trusted figure in the community, known for his dedication to animals and their families. But what truly sets him apart is his unique history as a caretaker for LSU's iconic live tiger mascots, Mike IV and Mike V—a role that not only honed his veterinary skills but also deepened his understanding of the profound bond between humans and animals.

## A Legacy Rooted in Louisiana

Born and raised in the vibrant city of New Orleans, Dr. Perret's passion for animals was evident from a young age. He attended Holy Cross High School and pursued his undergraduate studies at the University of New Orleans. His academic journey culminated at Louisiana State University’s School of Veterinary Medicine, where he earned his Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree in 1990. It was during his time at LSU that Dr. Perret embarked on an extraordinary chapter of his life—serving as the student caretaker for the university's revered live tiger mascots.

## Guardianship of LSU's Majestic Mascots

While many veterinarians build their careers caring for beloved cats and dogs, Dr. Jeffrey Perret’s early veterinary experience involved looking after a much larger feline—two of them, in fact. As a veterinary student at Louisiana State University, Dr. Perret served as the official student caretaker for LSU’s live tiger mascots, Mike IV and Mike V. It was a role few are trusted with, demanding both medical precision and deep personal commitment.

  
Every morning and evening, Dr. Perret fed and observed the tigers, monitored their health, and worked closely with LSU faculty to ensure their environment remained enriching and secure. “There’s no manual for caring for a live tiger,” he says. “You develop a respect for their power, but also a recognition of their individual personality and needs.” The experience not only sharpened his clinical instincts, but also laid the foundation for his lifelong approach to treating every animal—regardless of size—with dignity and attentiveness.

  
The tigers he cared for weren’t just campus mascots—they were symbols of pride for the entire LSU community. LSU’s tradition of maintaining a live tiger on campus began in 1936 and continues to this day. Named “Mike the Tiger” after Mike Chambers, a former athletic trainer, each tiger mascot has become a living emblem of school spirit, strength, and resilience.

  
This formative experience with two of LSU’s most iconic animals gave Dr. Perret a rare perspective—not just on exotic animal care, but on the profound connection people form with the animals they love. Today, he brings that same reverence and professionalism into homes across New Orleans, where his patients may be smaller, but never less significant.

## A Life Dedicated to Compassionate CareA Life Dedicated to Compassionate Care

After graduating, Dr. Perret embarked on a veterinary career that spanned over three decades, encompassing general practice and specialized care. Throughout his journey, he remained committed to providing empathetic and personalized care to each patient. Now based in Covington, Louisiana, Dr. Perret enjoys a fulfilling personal life with his wife, their four children, and five grandchildren. Whether embarking on road trips or cherishing family moments, he embraces life's adventures with the same passion he brings to his veterinary work.
