Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I have always had deep respect and reverence for all species. Aligning my career with my purpose has been a lifelong journey. After college, I explored the human-only social services field. After doing some deep-purpose work, I became clear that veterinary medicine would be my path for service work. It is an honor to support families and their beloved animals during the end-of-life process.

> Dr. Elizabeth Parks truly was an angel that made the whole experience of it being our mastiff Frasier's time to pass. The support and service was absolutely personalized, not rushed, we felt validated, heard, we had choices and power/control over many aspects of the experience- something my husband was really fearful of not being able to do due to Frasier's trust issues with others (not liking to be looked in the eyes by people outside of the family, growling, etc.). Frasier had a history is distrust and intense fear/insecurities when it came to any vet clinic or individual in various roles. Vet visits were typically traumatic in nature for Frasier as well as my husband due to him needing a muzzle, having to be sedated for every visit... despite the reason for the appt. Dr. Elizabeth Parks truly cared about Frasier and us despite just meeting us. She offered text and phone call support beforehand, offered advice when desired and listened. She absolutely cared about Frasier, our other dog Donnie and my family. My husband and I cannot get over how amazing she was. There was no judgement felt with what we chose and how we were managing the loss of our baby. She respected Frasier's boundaries and read our body language- her timing was perfect in regards to supporting those involved, answering questions and giving us time alone with Frasier. Thank you so much! We are so grateful for choosing this in-home service to help our Frasier pass. We highly recommend to anyone in similar situations. In-home euthanasia was something that helped Frasier pass without intense stress and trauma. Thank you, thank you!

> Dr. Elizabeth Parks is wonderful and her care of my dog in his last hours was superb. She was also took good care of us -- me, my son, and my daughter-in-law -- during one of the most difficult times of our lives. Yes, it was a euthanasia situation, but somehow Elizabeth made it positive, warm, and even calm experience. I am hugely impressed at the many skills she brought to bear during her visit with us. I am a lifelong Elizabeth and CodaPet fan!!!

> Dr Elizabeth Parks was so wonderful. When we made the difficult decision to put our beloved dog down, we knew we wanted to do it at home. Bo hated having to go to the vet and being able to let him pass in at home helped make a difficult day more bearable. Dr Elizabeth allowed us to have as much time with Bo as we needed. She explained everything throughly and told us what we could expect. She was compassionate and caring. She checked in on us in the days that followed which meant a lot to us.
