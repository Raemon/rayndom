Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

Becoming a veterinarian was never just about medicine for me—it was about love, compassion, and the deep bond we share with our pets. Saying goodbye is one of the hardest moments we face as pet parents, and I believe it should be met with the same love and kindness that carried our pets through their lives. My goal is to provide a peaceful, pain-free transition for pets while supporting the families who love them.

## What pet parents are saying

> This is the second time we’ve had the privilege of using Dr. Lisa to help one of our beloved dogs transition to the other side. While nothing can take the pain of losing a pet away, I can say without reservation that Dr. Lisa made the experience as peaceful and gentle as possible. Her genuine compassion for both animals and their grieving family members is evident from first contact to last breath. We are so thankful we were able to say goodbye to our precious Isla in the comfort of our home, rather than adding the stress of a vet visit to her final moments. We also are eternally grateful that we had someone as caring and empathetic as Dr. Lisa to help us during such a difficult time.

> While this was a very difficult time for us, Dr Lisa was amazing from start to finish. While showing empathy she explained every step of the process and stayed by our side and mourned our loss with us. She was absolutely amazing. She thought of everything and every moment was well detaily planned out and showed how much love she put into it. From our final goodbye even so much to have the car set up for a loving final ride for our luna with flowers and all. Absolutely amazing and caring. We could not have asked for a more beautiful experience to say our goodbye to Luna.

> Having Dr. Lisa help us let our boy cross over the rainbow bridge was the best decision we could have made. She was amazing and because of this I truly believe it made it a bit easier to move forward without Winky. I also believe since we had it done at the house, his spirit is still there and that is so comforting. We talk to him all the time!!

> Dr. Lisa Littlejohn is truly an angel, sent to us at exactly the right time. The time drew near quicker than we anticipated and she made us a priority. Dr. Lisa arrived at our home which allowed Juno to spend his last moments in his favorite place, surrounded by love and comfort. We can’t begin to express our gratitude for her kindness and compassion during the most difficult day of our lives. Her gentle presence, calm demeanor and professional sensitivity made the unbearable transition peaceful. Dr. Lisa handled Juno, myself and my husband with great dignity and respect. Knowing Juno passes so serenely brought us a profound measure of comfort. Dr. Lisa went the extra mile starting with the call for help to departing our home, handling every aspect of the process with heartfelt empathy. We would encourage anyone to seek out Dr. Lisa Littlejohn, as there is no one more qualified, to guide you through this difficult journey.

> Deciding to use Codapet and Dr. Lisa Littlejohn was the best decision we could have made. Dr. Lisa was incredibly kind and compassionate every step of the process. From the moment Dr. Lisa walked into our home, we felt at peace. She explained every step, was in every moment with us and even cried with us. Dr. Lisa was so thoughtful throughout the process as well. Bringing snacks and yummy chocolates for our boy Tango’s last treats. Dr Lisa’s routine is so carefully thought out for the comfort of our pet and for us. The very last step was walking out to her car for Tango’s final ride. Dr. Lisa’s thoughtful act of kindness had her car beautifully set up with flowers. She encouraged one last final goodbye kiss to our boy Tango then gave us the BIGGEST HUGS ever. For such a terrible occasion, Dr. Lisa made it possible for us to get through it all. I have already given out Dr. Lisa’s info and will continue to do so. Can not recommend a better person for this. I sure hope Dr. Lisa is still practicing this act of kindness when it’s our boy Milo’s turn. Thank You Dr. Lisa for the Best experience for us saying goodbye to Tango. So much love and appreciation, Jamie and Andrea.

> Dr Lisa was phenomenal. I was an absolute mess knowing that we would have to put our sweet girl down. I appreciated her empathy through the entire process. She brought a lot of treats for our sweet girl. This is a hard process but she was very helpful, informative and reassuring. I couldn't of asked for a better person to be there while Jewels took her last breath. Thank You Dr Littlejohn! Santiago Family
