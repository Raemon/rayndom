## Pet euthanasia and cremation pricing in Washington, IN

### Reservations and payments

Your credit card is required to reserve your appointment. However, no payment is required until the appointment and nothing is due until the appointment is completed

### Cancellation policy or pet passing

We charge cancellation fee of $100 if an appointment is cancelled less than 4 hours before the start time. If your pet passes away before your appointment you would not be charged a cancellation fee. If the vet you scheduled is able, and you would like their assistance with cremation, then pickup fee would apply instead of euthanasia fee

## Other Consideration

### Large Animals

If you have a larger pet, your vet may need the help of one friend or family member. Talk to your vet about options and limitations when they reach out to you prior to your appointment, and they will inform you of any extra cost for your situation. 

### How do I get my pet’s ashes

Options for your pets return home and memorabilia depend on your local provider. Your vet coordinate the return of your pet’s ashes and let you know if there are additional fees for urn delivery. 

### Special factors affecting price

Extra time or medications needed can affect the total price. Other factors can be if it is decided that it’s not time to euthanize your pet after the vet has arrive. In that case, only the travel fee, platform fee, and a quality of life consult would apply. 

## FAQs

### What’s included in the total cost?

The total cost includes the in-home pet euthanasia service fee, any travel fee (if any apply), and a platform fee. Additionally, depending on your choice, fees may apply for cremation services or keepsakes.

### Will the vet take my pet with them after the appointment?

During your appointment, your vet will confirm your aftercare selection with you. If you choose to arrange cremation services, your vet will oversee your pet’s transportation to a local facility for cremation. If your preferred cremation option includes the return of your pet’s ashes to you, your vet will discuss the process to reunite you with your pet's ashes and the anticipated time frame during your appointment

### Will the vet examine my pet once they get to my home?

Yes, upon arrival the veterinarian will assess your pet. This can look different than an “nose to tail” examination in a clinic setting and will focus more on the pet’s history and quality of life.

### What if I am not sure it is time?

It is not uncommon to have doubts about whether the time is right. If you’ve taken the Quality of Life Questionnaire and are still unsure, we recommend consulting with your family veterinarian before scheduling an appointment.  
  
Rest assured, if you book an appointment, your in-home euthanasia veterinarian will let you know if they do not believe that euthanasia is appropriate at this time.

### How long will the procedure take?

You can expect your veterinarian to be in your home from 20-60 minutes, depending on how much of that time you need or want throughout the process.

### What is in home pet euthanasia, and how does it work?

In home pet euthanasia allows your pet to pass away peacefully in the comfort of your home surrounded by love. A compassionate veterinarian will provide end-of-life care for your pet starting with an initial end-of-life exam followed by sedation to ensure your pet is comfortable. Your vet will always move at your pace so you have the time you need to say your goodbyes. Once you are ready, your vet will administer medication to help them gently and painlessly say goodbye surrounded by comfort and love.

### How do I tell if my pet is suffering?

Signs your pet may be suffering include chronic pain, difficulty breathing, loss of appetite, inability to stand or walk, or a loss of interest in daily activities. These symptoms could indicate a decline in their quality of life. You know your pet better than anyone, but speaking to a veterinarian can help you assess whether euthanasia is the most compassionate option. If you feel you need more help, you can read our guide on ‘[How will I know it’s time](https://www.codapet.com/how-will-i-know-when-its-time)’, take a [quality of life assessment](https://www.codapet.com/quality-of-life-scale), or call customer care at **833-263-2738**.

### What should I do if my pet is declining fast?

If your pet's health is declining rapidly, it’s crucial to take the following steps:

  * **Consult Your Veterinarian** : Schedule an appointment to discuss your observations and any scoring from a quality-of-life scale. This information can help guide the conversation about your pet's condition and options moving forward. Your vet may suggest palliative care, hospice, or, if necessary, euthanasia.  

  * **Ensure Comfort** : Create a quiet, cozy space with soft bedding and easy access to food, water, and a litter box (if applicable).  

  * **Minimize Stress** : Keep routines simple and familiar, and limit loud noises or disruptions.  

  * **Offer Gentle Care** : Provide a soothing touch through gentle petting and offer favorite treats if they can still eat.  

  * **Consider At-Home Euthanasia** : If appropriate, discuss the option of at-home euthanasia with your vet for a peaceful and familiar passing.  

  * **Reach Out for Support** : It's okay to lean on loved ones, pet-loss support groups, or counselors to help navigate this difficult time.



  
If you're noticing signs of declining health, we encourage you to use our [quality of life scale ](https://www.codapet.com/quality-of-life-scale)assessment to evaluate your pet's condition before your vet visit.

### What is the difference between in home pet euthanasia and euthanasia at a vet clinic?

The key difference is the setting. At home euthanasia allows your pet to pass peacefully in the comfort of their familiar surroundings, reducing stress and anxiety. This option especially benefits pets who may feel scared or uncomfortable traveling to a clinic. It also offers your family a private, intimate experience during this emotional time. While some urgent situations don’t allow for time to schedule in-home euthanasia, many pet owners in Washington, IN choose in-home services for the peaceful atmosphere and compassionate care their pets receive right where they feel safest. You can [find flexible availability](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment) for our local vets here, or look for [same-day euthanasia](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request) appointments.

### Will my pet experience any pain during euthanasia?

No, pet euthanasia at home is designed to be completely painless. After an initial end-of-life assessment, your veterinarian will first administer a sedative to ensure your pet is relaxed and comfortable. The euthanasia medication then gently stops the heart without causing pain. The process is peaceful and allows your pet to pass without distress.

### Is there a service provider for in home pet euthanasia near me?

### How much does in home euthanasia cost for pets in my area?

Once you have picked your provider, the cost will usuallydepend on your pet’s size and any additional services you may choose, such as cremation, keepsakes, or other services.

### Is the cost of euthanasia for dogs and cats the same?

Most providers in Washington, IN charge a flat fee for euthanasia, although some providers do charge based on the size of your pet, so small dogs and cats can be the same price; however, medium or large-size dogs (such as Bulldogs, Australian Shepherds, Labradors, or German Shepherds) will likely carry a higher price.

### What should I expect during an in home pet euthanasia appointment?

During an in home euthanasia appointment, your veterinarian will make an assessment of your pet’s health and quality of life to provide guidance to ensure your decision is informed. The veterinarian will administer an initial sedative or anesthetic to help your pet relax and become pain-free, ensuring they are comfortable and at ease. In the last stage, your veterinarian will first ensure your pet is fully sedated before gently administering anesthesia which will quickly slow down your pet’s respiratory system until the heart finally stops beating. In most cases, this process takes less than a minute. Your veterinarian will always move at your pace so the process is as comfortable as possible for your pet and your family.

### How far in advance do I need to make an appointment?

The notice for every veterinarian differs, however, most veterinarians require at least a 2-hour notice from the time you need them to arrive at your home. This allows them time to prepare and ensure they can provide the highest level of care and compassion for your pet. It also accounts for their travel time, as your veterinarian may be traveling from many different locations around Washington, IN.

  
While you can request a [same-day and emergency services](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request), it's always best to contact us as early as possible to ensure availability and to give both you and your veterinarian time to prepare for this important moment.

### What should I expect in terms of my pet’s behavior during the pet euthanasia process?

During the euthanasia process, your pet will be gently guided to a state of peace and comfort. After a sedative is administered, you can expect them to become calm and relaxed, free from any pain or distress. When the final injection is given, your pet will slowly drift off into a deep sleep before passing away peacefully. Your compassionate veterinarian will ensure the process is as gentle and serene as possible, allowing you to be present with your beloved companion in their final moments of love and care.

### Can I be with my pet during the euthanasia process?

Yes, during the in home euthanasia process, you are encouraged to be with your pet throughout the entire process. Being there provides comfort and reassurance to your pet as they pass peacefully.

### How do I know when it’s time to consider euthanasia for my pet?

Every pet is different, and you know yours better than anyone, however, it may be time to consider euthanasia when you notice more ‘bad days than good’. It’s important to keep an eye on your pet’s quality of life and try to understand when it has declined, such as no longer enjoying activities or suffering from unmanageable pain. To help you understand their quality of life, you take a [Quality of Life Assessment](https://www.codapet.com/quality-of-life-scale), which helps you get a more clear picture of your pet’s well-being at this point in time.

Remember, if you are unsure, speaking with your primary care veterinarian can help better understand your pet’s quality of life. It’s important to speak with your primary care veterinarian if you haven’t yet to understand your pet’s health. If you do not have a primary care veterinarian, consider visiting an urgent care or emergency hospital in your area.

### How should I prepare my home for my pet’s euthanasia?

Everyone’s experience in saying goodbye to their beloved companion is different and very personal. It’s important to consider that you know your pet best. Some considerations, however, are choosing a comfortable space where your pet feels safe, sometimes their favorite spot in your home. Another consideration can be to gather any family members who wish to be present and feel free to bring your pet’s favorite blanket or toys, etc that make them feel comfortable. When your veterinarian arrives they will guide you through each step in the process and help you move at your pace to ensure the process is as peaceful as possible.

### How long does the euthanasia procedure typically take?

In-home euthanasia procedures usually take about 10-15 minutes, however, the total time can vary depending on the pace you and your family prefer to move at and your pet’s comfort level. Your veterinarian will take the time necessary to ensure you feel you have enough time to be with your beloved pet while also ensuring your pet is calm and relaxed before proceeding. In some cases, this may take longer, especially if your pet is anxious or uncomfortable.  


We understand that saying goodbye is a deeply emotional experience, and we encourage families to take as much time as they need during the process. Our goal is to create a peaceful and compassionate environment for both you and your pet.

### What should I do after the euthanasia procedure is completed?

After the euthanasia, you are welcome to spend as much time as you need with your pet to say goodbye. If you’ve chosen any cremation services to handle your pet’s body, your veterinarian will reconfirm your choices and gently transport your pet when you are ready. If you’ve chosen any keepsakes offered by the crematorium, like Claw Paw Prints, Ink nose prints, or other memorabilia, your veterinarian will reconfirm your choices before leaving your home. If you have any questions or want to change your mind about any of your choices, you can discuss your options with your veterinarian before they leave your home.

### What are my options for cremation?

After the in home euthanasia procedure, your veterinarian will provide you with time to say goodbye to your pet. Once you're ready, they will re-confirm the preferred aftercare option that you choose when reserving your time with your veterinarian. In Washington, IN you can select two types of cremation services:

  * **Individual Cremation (Ashes Returned)** : An individual cremation is a process where your pet will be cremated separated with physical barriers in the chamber. This ensures the separation with other pets in the chamber so you may reunite with your pet’s ashes. Your pet’s ashes will be returned to you in an urn of your choice. If you choose an additional urn then your pet’s ashes will be returned in the urn of your choice.  

  * **Communal Cremation (No Ashes Returned)** : A communal cremation is a process where your pet is cremated in a chamber with other pets. Once the process is complete, the crematorium will respectfully scatter your pet’s remains among other pets. It’s important to note, you pet’s ashes will not be returned to you.



Some of our veterinarians offer an additional option known as **Private Cremation (Ashes Returned)**. In this option, only your pet is in the cremation chamber, ensuring that the recovered ashes are solely your pet's. These ashes can be returned in an urn of your choice, with additional urn options available. To see if private cremation is available with your provider, please refer to our [booking page](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment).  


**Note** : If you choose to leave your pet's body with your veterinarian, rest assured it will be handled with the utmost care, respect, and dignity. Your veterinarian will coordinate all aftercare arrangements as requested, allowing you to focus on yourself and your family after this difficult goodbye.

### How do I get my pet’s ashes back?

Your veterinarian will coordinate the return of your pet’s ashes before they leave your home. Your options include having your pet’s remains delivered by your veterinarian (for an additional fee), shipping them to you (for an additional fee), or picking them up from your primary clinic or the crematorium.

### Are there any low-cost or no-cost pet euthanasia solutions?

Saying goodbye to a beloved pet is never easy, and we understand that cost can be a concern for many pet parents. While we specialize in premium in-home euthanasia services, we also want to acknowledge that cost may be a concern. If you're looking for low-cost or no-cost pet euthanasia options in Washington, IN, consider reaching out to the following:

  * **Local Animal Shelters & Humane Societies** – Many provide low-cost or donation-based euthanasia services, often with cremation options.  

  * **Low-Cost Veterinary Clinics & Nonprofits** – Some vet clinics and nonprofits offer reduced-cost euthanasia, sometimes supported by grants or donations.  

  * **Animal Control Services** – In certain cases, local animal control agencies may offer euthanasia services for terminally ill or suffering pets at a lower cost.



**Note:** When considering a low-cost pet euthanasia option, it's important to call ahead to check availability, as some providers may require an appointment or have eligibility criteria, such as income-based assistance. Be sure to ask about additional costs, including cremation or aftercare services, which may not be included in the base price. Additionally, verify service details, as some options may have restrictions based on your pet’s size, health condition, or location.

While low-cost options are available, many pet parents choose in-home euthanasia to ensure a peaceful, stress-free farewell in the comfort of their home. If you're looking for a private, compassionate experience, we’re here to help.

> Using CodaPet was so easy; from searching for a vet near me to clear pricing. Once booked they remained in constant communication with me throughout the process, providing time updates, etc. Our family was matched with Dr.Kelsey Jones and I can not recommend her enough. She arrived promptly, listened to our concerns, examined our furbaby Ciddy and gave us ample time to grieve and make the final decision. At no moment did I feel pressured to rush. She gave us time to set up an area outside and spoke to us like a friend throughout the process, while treating all of us with respect and compassion. She even made a suggestion on how to allow our other dog to say goodbye (which I would never have thought of). It’s not an easy choice to let go of a beloved pet but i feel this was the best way to do it and highly recommend her services.

> After making the difficult decision to help our elderly bulldog cross the rainbow bridge, we found CodaPet online, offering in-home euthanasia. Our dog was a large breed and could hardly walk, and I couldn’t bear the thought of transporting her to a cold clinic for her final moments with us. Dr. Michelli arrived at our home and was so kind and gentle with our sweet girl; she explained to us how things would work and gave us time to answer any questions. We were so thankful to be able to say our final goodbyes to our fur baby in the privacy of our home and with her in the comfort of her own bed. Our hearts are broken by the loss, but I couldn’t have wished for a better way to have gone about this experience. Thank you, Dr. M and CodaPet. 🙏🏻🌈

He’s also very experienced and made what I expected to be a traumatic experience (in home pet euthanasia) as peaceful as it could be and I will be forever grateful for that. I felt awful that I waited a day or two too long before making the decision, but having Dr. Clark be the one to help us was the right choice. We’ll now be taking our other dog to his practice for care.

> Dr. Loughmiller was very accommodating to meet our needs at the last minute for our beloved Titan. She kept in touch with her arrival time and was extremely understanding and very kind upon arriving so late at night. Saying goodbye to your pet is the most difficult thing to do but the level of care never wavered. From her gentle approach to the dignified and formal way that Titan was carried out of the house - placed gently on a stretcher with a sheet laid upon him so delicately - will always be a comforting way to remember making the most difficult decision of my life and saying goodbye to my best friend.

> We had to make the incredibly hard decision to put our cat down, and Dr. Diana was truly wonderful. She was kind, compassionate, and never rushed us. She gave us the time and space we needed and treated our cat with such care and dignity. I especially appreciated that she brought a basket to carry our cat after she had passed. It was a small detail, but it meant a lot during such an emotional moment. I am very grateful for her gentleness and professionalism.

> Dr. Stadler was incredibly kind, compassionate and professional. She made an unbearable situation as positive as it could be under the circumstances. Our beloved dog was treated with the utmost dignity and respect. We are extremely grateful that she was willing to come as early as possible on a weekend. I would highly recommend this service for anyone facing this difficult decision.

> I have had loved and lost a lot of pets. This was the first time I used an at home vet. I couldn't have another traumatic experience embrazened in my memory. Both my cat and I loved Dr. Amanda. She is so kind and respectful and she values the love you two share. I highly suggest that if you are considering this option you let Dr. Amanda help you.

> Putting a pet down is never any easy decision to make. Our 14 year old lab mix, Sam, had been on a steady decline since spring of 2024. We thought we were going to have to say goodbye in May, but with treatment of his symptoms he bounced back relatively well. However, Sam's mobility was becoming more and more limited, to the point that we would have to help him up from lying down. Sam had the unfortunate luck of contracting mange in his old age as well. After defeating the mites, it took a toll on him. My wife and I do not have children and our dogs are our kids. Sam is the youngest, but has had the roughest life. We decided the time had come for Sam to pass-on with what dignity he could. We were going to take him into the vet, but thought about the aftermath of us in a public place, getting Sam in a bag/box, then having to unwrap him at home. We opted to use an in home pet euthanasia. CodaPet was the recommended service by our Vet. We had prepared a bed outside (perfect weather), fed Sam some pizza, and loved on him until Dr. Loughmiller arrived right on time. Dr. Loughmiller was professional and concise. She answered any questions we had about the procedure and was timely the process. Her follow-up after the procedure was appreciated as well. She sent us a mailer that included a daangle decoration with a stamped metal dog paw, rainbow crystals, clear crystals, and Sam's name on a tag. Along with the Rainbow Bridge poem. It was appreciated and he hung the decoration about our kitchen sink. We will, unfortunately, be using CodaPet again in the not so distant future, since we have two other elderly dogs. Thanks for what you provide.

> Words cannot express our gratitude and appreciation for the service that Dr. Mays and her company provided to our family. If and when the time comes to make that hurtful decision, Dr. Mays and the Coda company are the best to consider. Thanks once again for helping my family & me ease through this transition. Phd

> Dr. Loughmiller made the trip to us on the same day we made our request for in home services. She explained everything that she was going to do and what to expect. She was gentle, understanding, and kind during our grieving process. Thank you so much for easing our beloved Dexter's passing, at home, and surrounded by those that loved him.

> We had a sudden need for home pet euthanasia for our beloved little dog, Jellybean. None of our local vets offered the service timely, so we had to try an unknown. I found CodaPet online and there were appointments available. Dr. Gordon at CodaPet was wonderful. The whole process went smoothly. Communication was thorough. She was a little late, but kept us updated (because you can't rush these things). She said all the right things and comforted us in our decision. We are heartbroken, but at least this part will be a good memory. Our pup was at home, peaceful, and not stressed out by being at the vet. We pet him, cried, told stories, and he just fell asleep. People who provide this service are special people. We SO appreciated being home for his final day. We would not hesitate to recommend Dr. Gordon if you unfortunately need this service.
