Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

Our pets become our beloved family members. After helping hundreds of families through end-of-life decisions in the emergency setting, I became experienced in being able to develop relationships with owners during times of stress (often times unexpected) and grieving. It was during my time in emergency that I realized the profound impact that the hospital environment plays into the end-of-life experience for not only the families but their pets as well. As a pet parent myself, I made the decision to leave ER and transition to practicing in-home euthanasia full time in order to fulfill my passion of providing a more serene experience for both the pet and the family members.
