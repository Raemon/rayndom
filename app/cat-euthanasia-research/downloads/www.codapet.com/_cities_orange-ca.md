Thank you Dr. Lis! I didn’t expect to loose my dog Monte so soon, but there was so much comfort in knowing that when it was time to put him to sleep; he was at home, in bed, wearing his comfy pjs. The process wasn’t long for him, and Dr. Lis was very kind in the words she used to help me get through such a painful time. ❤️

Dr. Lisa Fieg was very accommodating and compassionate while providing in-home euthanasia services for my rapidly declining Basset Hound. She came out the same night after hearing that my dog was experiencing seizures. I highly recommend her for anytime one has to euthanize their pet and wants to have it done at home.

We can’t thank Dr. Daniela enough for helping us say goodbye to our amazing boy, Apollos. He had terminal lung cancer and suddenly was struggling to breathe. We knew it was finally time to make the difficult decision to say goodbye to our best friend. We contacted Dr.Daniela after reading her amazing reviews. We wanted nothing but the best for our boy and she is it! She went above and beyond. During our appointment she immediately put our pup at ease (he took to her right away.) The entire process, while one of the most difficult decisions, was the best final gift and thank you we could’ve given our pup. Dr. Daniella never rushed us, allowing as much time as we needed through each step. And in the comfort of his home, with his favorite blanket, surrounded by so much love our boy very peacefully went to sleep. We can’t thank Dr. Daniela enough for making this unwanted journey easier to deal with. We felt like a caring friend had stepped into our home to help us through the difficult goodbye. If you’re on the fence about what to do, I pray our experience will help you make the decision to give your furry family member the best send off you possibly can.

## Pet euthanasia and cremation pricing in Orange, CA

### Reservations and payments

Your credit card is required to reserve your appointment. However, no payment is required until the appointment and nothing is due until the appointment is completed

### Cancellation policy or pet passing

We charge cancellation fee of $100 if an appointment is cancelled less than 4 hours before the start time. If your pet passes away before your appointment you would not be charged a cancellation fee. If the vet you scheduled is able, and you would like their assistance with cremation, then pickup fee would apply instead of euthanasia fee

[Personalize Quote](/schedule-appointment "Personalize Quote")

## Other Consideration

### Large Animals

If you have a larger pet, your vet may need the help of one friend or family member. Talk to your vet about options and limitations when they reach out to you prior to your appointment, and they will inform you of any extra cost for your situation. 

### How do I get my pet’s ashes

Options for your pets return home and memorabilia depend on your local provider. Your vet coordinate the return of your pet’s ashes and let you know if there are additional fees for urn delivery. 

### Special factors affecting price

Extra time or medications needed can affect the total price. Other factors can be if it is decided that it’s not time to euthanize your pet after the vet has arrive. In that case, only the travel fee, platform fee, and a quality of life consult would apply. 

## FAQs

### What’s included in the total cost?

The total cost includes the in-home pet euthanasia service fee, any travel fee (if any apply), and a platform fee. Additionally, depending on your choice, fees may apply for cremation services or keepsakes.

### Will the vet take my pet with them after the appointment?

During your appointment, your vet will confirm your aftercare selection with you. If you choose to arrange cremation services, your vet will oversee your pet’s transportation to a local facility for cremation. If your preferred cremation option includes the return of your pet’s ashes to you, your vet will discuss the process to reunite you with your pet's ashes and the anticipated time frame during your appointment

### Will the vet examine my pet once they get to my home?

Yes, upon arrival the veterinarian will assess your pet. This can look different than an “nose to tail” examination in a clinic setting and will focus more on the pet’s history and quality of life.

### What if I am not sure it is time?

It is not uncommon to have doubts about whether the time is right. If you’ve taken the Quality of Life Questionnaire and are still unsure, we recommend consulting with your family veterinarian before scheduling an appointment.  
  
Rest assured, if you book an appointment, your in-home euthanasia veterinarian will let you know if they do not believe that euthanasia is appropriate at this time.

### How long will the procedure take?

You can expect your veterinarian to be in your home from 20-60 minutes, depending on how much of that time you need or want throughout the process.

> Dr. Clark could not have been a more kind, compassionate and patient veterinarian. He’s also very experienced and made what I expected to be a traumatic experience (in home pet euthanasia) as peaceful as it could be and I will be forever grateful for that. I felt awful that I waited a day or two too long before making the decision, but having Dr. Clark be the one to help us was the right choice. We’ll now be taking our other dog to his practice for care.

> Using CodaPet was so easy; from searching for a vet near me to clear pricing. Once booked they remained in constant communication with me throughout the process, providing time updates, etc. Our family was matched with Dr.Kelsey Jones and I can not recommend her enough. She arrived promptly, listened to our concerns, examined our furbaby Ciddy and gave us ample time to grieve and make the final decision. At no moment did I feel pressured to rush. She gave us time to set up an area outside and spoke to us like a friend throughout the process, while treating all of us with respect and compassion. She even made a suggestion on how to allow our other dog to say goodbye (which I would never have thought of). It’s not an easy choice to let go of a beloved pet but i feel this was the best way to do it and highly recommend her services.

> We had a sudden need for home pet euthanasia for our beloved little dog, Jellybean. None of our local vets offered the service timely, so we had to try an unknown. I found CodaPet online and there were appointments available. Dr. Gordon at CodaPet was wonderful. The whole process went smoothly. Communication was thorough. She was a little late, but kept us updated (because you can't rush these things). She said all the right things and comforted us in our decision. We are heartbroken, but at least this part will be a good memory. Our pup was at home, peaceful, and not stressed out by being at the vet. We pet him, cried, told stories, and he just fell asleep. People who provide this service are special people. We SO appreciated being home for his final day. We would not hesitate to recommend Dr. Gordon if you unfortunately need this service.

> After making the difficult decision to help our elderly bulldog cross the rainbow bridge, we found CodaPet online, offering in-home euthanasia. Our dog was a large breed and could hardly walk, and I couldn’t bear the thought of transporting her to a cold clinic for her final moments with us. Dr. Michelli arrived at our home and was so kind and gentle with our sweet girl; she explained to us how things would work and gave us time to answer any questions. We were so thankful to be able to say our final goodbyes to our fur baby in the privacy of our home and with her in the comfort of her own bed. Our hearts are broken by the loss, but I couldn’t have wished for a better way to have gone about this experience. Thank you, Dr. M and CodaPet. 🙏🏻🌈

She quickly assessed our cat Ronnie and agreed it was time. She explained what she would do and what would happen. She was very gentle and kind with our pet. She arrived totally prepared and acted to calm Ronnie and make the visit as comforting as possible. We can’t say enough good things about her professionalism and kindness to our pet and my husband and me. It’s very clear she loves animals. We would highly recommend her to help your cat in Sanger, CA area.
