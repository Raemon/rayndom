Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

Becoming a veterinarian was a lifelong dream. I have always felt solace around animals. I understood as a child that animals are amazing - not because they are like us - but because they are like themselves. I am deeply committed to helping people understand what their beloved pet is experiencing and when (and how) to say goodbye. I feel called to do this work - to stand next to people as they navigate the beautiful heartache that comes from loving creatures we outlive. I see the best of people every day - as they break their hearts and heal their hearts. I am motivated by the love I see - the tenderness - the mercy.

Her gentle nature with both our dog and we humans was calming, and she provided all the information we needed to fully understand what was going to happen and what options were open to us.

> This was an extremely difficult decision to make, even though we knew it was the right one. Dr.Delia assured us that the symptoms & body movements that Georgie was making, were indicative of end of life. She was extremely respectful and explained what the experience would be like for our cat. She was thorough in her explanation of the actual process, but also took the time to not rush us and treated us & Georgie with great care & dignity. As hard as it was to say goodbye, it was lovely that he wasn’t in pain or afraid in his final moments.

> This is a very difficult life event but having Dr Delia assist with the process of letting our little lovely girl leave her life, in a peaceful and loving way, was not only the right thing to do for our little girl but it was also the best way for us to say goodbye. I am so glad that Dr. Delia was available. Dr Delia is a very caring, calming, and understanding soul which is very helpful. If you can, you should try to make plans to let your beloved pets go peacefully. It is best for them, and for you, and Coda and Dr Delia make it easy to plan for this very difficult day.

It is a decision I'm extremely happy we made since Jaxx weighed atleast 115 lbs. It turns out his leg had broke (hours prior) due to the cancer. Cancer SUCKS!

> Dr. Delia was so kind throughout the process of euthanasia for my beloved cat, Tom. None of my family could be here so I was by myself and beyond distraught. Dr. Delia did not rush me and was very patient and kind to me and Tom. She spoke to Tom as if he were her own beloved pet and was so kind and gentle with him, telling him what a good boy he was and how well he was doing. I was so thankful for Dr. Delia, as I was dreading saying goodbye to Tom and Dr. Delia made me feel at peace. I hope that Dr. Delia will be the one to help me if and when I need end of life help for a pet again.

> I couldn't be more grateful to have found Dr. Delia and Coda Pet. I wasn't sure what to think initially since I just found Coda Pet online and it wasn't listed or referred by an of the local vets I'd spoken too. I'm so happy I trusted them! It was very difficult finding somebody to come for in-home euthanasia on urgent notice especially with my husky Koda taking a major turn on a big holiday week. Dr. Delia was able to do it on a whim and reschedule with me as needed given how moment-to-moment Koda was. She even drove all the way back from her holiday early to be able to help support us. Even more, Dr. Delia was an absolute rockstar for a very tricky situation. Koda was crying to be outside during it. We didn't think about time and it turned dark by the time it was time to do the procedure. His veins had collapsed and after multiple rounds, ended up needing an IV to perform the procedure (in the dark!). Dr. Delia handled it all while caring to our needs in this difficult time and even keeping unaware neighbors away. She was an absolute angel. I couldn't have asked for a better person to help with the most difficult day of my life. Bless you and thank you. Dr. Delia Love, Neil, Marissa, Pat & Koda

> Dr. Delia Gregory-Macdonald was so kind, compassionate and understanding of the difficult decision it was to put down our beloved dog Bandit -our rescue dog of 15 years and one that we had before having kids! Dr. Delia really understood how painful this decision was and took the time to talk with me over the process and my concerns. She even shared her experience with putting down a beloved dog-so she gets it. I miss my Bandit dearly, but I know she is in a better place and I am so thankful of the support Delia was able to provide during that difficult time. Highly recommend Dr. Delia Gregory-Macdonald.

She was so sweet and loving to my dog throughout, and although I chose for it to be just me and my boy, her caring presence made me feel like I wasn't alone. Dr. Delia made the entire process so much easier and I am so grateful that she was recommended to me. Losing your loving companion is never easy, but having someone there by your side who's compassion truly makes you feel seen in all your sadness makes the process a little easier. I would highly recommend Dr. Delia.

> Dr Delia Gregory-Macdonald was amazing. Unfortunately, we have had a couple of experiences with in-home euthanasia and am actually glad I never heard back from our previous provider. It has now been 5 days and I've yet to hear back from our previous provider. Dr. Delia was so kind and caring. She immediately put myself, husband and adult son at ease while going through this incredibly painful task. She was very focused on easing our distress and making sure that our Zeke was not suffering. The whole experience was easy. I found CodaPet via google, explained my needs, put in my info and they matched us with Dr. Delia who was able to come to the house the following day. She started communicating with me right away and would have come sooner if it was needed, if our doggo was declining faster. Really cant say enough great things about Dr Delia and CodaPet.

> I couldn’t be more grateful to Dr Delia for her grounded compassion, sensitivity, and assured experience. She might as well also be titled a death dula and is truly a treasure. It’s unfortunate to have met under such circumstances but my gratitude for her expertise in this realm is forever and she is a lovely person. My best friend Mj went so peacefully and smoothly and it’s a forever gift for both of us. Dr Delia was wonderfully accommodating of my request to allow my other younger dog and dear human friend to also be present with us and witness, and she offered the most comforting kind and helpful words and information. It feels strange to leave a review for this but truly I would recommend her to any and all my loved ones faced with this decision regarding their own beloved furry family members. Thank you forever Dr Delia, from both me and my best friend’s spirit, you provided a compassionate healing, truly.

She had the hard job of telling me my dog had bone cancer and was patient in explaining prognosis and suggesting options for my dog’s sake as well as my own. When the time came to say goodbye, Delia came to my home within hours of my request. I’ve had a lot of dogs but this was by far the most peaceful departure I experienced. Much love and spirituality in the unrushed ceremony of celebrating life. My dog was calm and her soul was free to leave her body. I will be forever grateful for having Delia with us on this special day. Thank you Delia!

We're so grateful to have found her to help our beloved cat, Bowie cross over in the most peaceful and compassionate way possible. Our situation was a little tricky because our boy was not a fan of strangers but she patiently worked with us to develop a plan that eased not only his anxiety but ours as well. She held our hand the whole way but was also clear when we needed to be strong. With Dr. Delia's skillful guidance, we were able to say good-bye with peace and relief knowing that we did everything we could to honor our sweet boy's life.

In this incredibly emotional moment, Dr. Delia was a beacon of compassion, sensitivity, and care. From the moment we connected with her, Dr. Delia’s tender demeanor and genuine empathy made all the difference. She approached Libby’s transition with the utmost respect, ensuring that every step was gentle and comforting—for Libby and for us. Her kindness gave us peace of mind and the reassurance that we were doing the right thing for our cherished companion. We are truly grateful to have had Dr. Delia by our side during this time. Her compassion turned what could have been an overwhelmingly painful experience into a deeply heartfelt and peaceful farewell. We cannot recommend her highly enough to anyone facing a similar journey. Thank you, Dr. Delia, for your extraordinary care and love.

> Our dog Char was dying of thyroid cancer and we came to the difficult decision to let her go. We were worried about the process and thought maybe we would be questioned by the vet regarding our decision. Dr Delia was so sympathetic and kind and gave us the support that we needed. Dr Delia made sure we understood everything and had time to ask questions. She made sure that Char’s passing was the most comfortable way possible. I would recommend Dr Delia to anyone that is looking into at home euthanasia for their beloved pet.

> We recently lost our beloved little boy, Dutch, and in wanting to keep him at home for his final journey, I found Dr. Delia on the Codapet website. What a Godsend she was. She arrived on time, spent an hour talking us through this most heartbreaking event with so much compassion and empathy for our overwhelming sadness. She was soothing and gentle with Dutch, and intimately understood our pug's rapid decline having a pug herself. He was the last of five pugs, and sadly that chapter of our life is gone forever with him. Godspeed my sweet boy, we will see you all again someday.

> I cannot begin to express our gratitude for the skilled, loving and compassionate care that Dr. Delia gave to Gabby and to us last Friday. She was at our home within three hours of my booking the appointment. She lovingly reassured our Gabby that she was going to help her and carefully explained everything that she would be doing. Gabby gently fell asleep in my arms. After Gabby was gone we walked her to Dr. Delia’s car together . Everything is taken care of for us; all arrangements are made and we’ll receive Gabby’s ashes to keep with us shortly. We are heartbroken, but able to look back on this most difficult of days with less pain knowing that Gabby went so peacefully, within a few hours after her legs failed her, in her familiar surroundings surrounded by love. Thank you Codapet and Dr. Delia!
