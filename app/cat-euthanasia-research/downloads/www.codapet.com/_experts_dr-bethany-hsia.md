# Dr. Bethany Hsia

Co-Founder, Codapet

Dr. Bethany Hsia has been practicing veterinary medicine since 2010. Dr. Bethany graduated from University of Illinois' College of Veterinary Medicine with a Doctorate in Veterinary Medicine. Prior to her graduate degree, Dr. Bethany studied at San Francisco State University earning her Bachelor of Science in Biology and a double minor in Chemistry and in Speech and Communications. Throughout her 13 year career in the veterinary field, Dr. Bethany has worked in private practice, shelter medicine and in the veterinary department of a local college. She now devotes her time, skills, and passion to helping pets and their families through in-home euthanasia. Dr. Bethany provided her first in-home euthanasia for an elderly dog in 2011 and truly believes it is one of the best options for end of life pet care. This is what drives her to make in-home euthanasia available to every pet parent who desires it. She strongly believes a peaceful passing is the last gift we give our pets and that it's a gift best given at home. Even as a child, Bethany sought to calm and comfort animals, keeping many common childhood pets and occasionally tending injured wildlife. Her interest in medicine and design of the immune system was sparked during an undergraduate course titled "Disease!" In her spare time Dr. Bethany enjoys writing and is an active author on the CodaPet resource page, writing about pet euthanasia, pet loss, dog and cat end of life care. She also likes reading, running but most of all spending time with her young family. In addition, she spends time with her hobby ranch which boasts 1 dog, 1 turtle, 2 snacks, 4 cats, 5 goats, and 20+ chickens, a salt-water tank and a foster pup with a broken leg…who will likely “foster fail” and become a permanent addition to the family.
