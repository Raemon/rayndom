Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I have never had to euthanize my own pets in the hospital setting and always want my pet owners to have the same opportunity. Its truly a beautiful peaceful experience though sadness and grief are present. I have found over the years that those who have chose this option, often can move past the grieving experience easier and remember the many happier precious memories together. Being a veterinarian was never a choice but a life calling. I was rescuing injured birds and worms and yelling at my brother for hurting ants as a very young child. Then I experienced the tragic sudden loss of a childhood pet and that solidified my desire to be a veterinarian. I wanted to do all I could to keep pets well and ease the pain of the animal and people who loved them when unexpected events occur. I have never forgotten the empathy and compassion I craved and the immense heartbreak I felt when I lost my best friend so suddenly .

## What pet parents are saying

> Dr. Silvesti was fantastic and made what could have been a very difficult process seem easy and natural. It was our first time leveraging an in-home euthanasia service and we had some hesitations. Literally could not have asked for a better way to help our 15 year old lab over the rainbow bridge. She was a consummate professional and ensured our lab was stress free.

> Having to let go of our Ramsay (our french bulldog) was one of the hardest things we have had to do. He meant everything to us and we loved him with all our heart - he was a part of our family and he made our home special. Dr Silvesti understood the gravity of our loss, she was kind and understanding. I would recommend her to anyone having to let go of a beloved pet.

> With tremendous heartache and anguish, on Thursday, June 26th, I had to say goodbye to my best friend and soul mate Kaya Sletzinger. She was a 10 year 3 month old Leonberger, who had been struggling with some health issues, most notably arthritis. If you have been through this before as a dog owner, then you know how burdensome it is. If you are a more recent dog owner, and haven’t been through this experience, it may seem unfathomable. I have been around dogs for all of my life, and I know that they’re absolutely the best things in this world. The only downside is that they don’t live long enough. Unfortunately I have experienced having to go to the veterinary hospital to put my best friend to sleep, but the much better option, is having a doctor come to your house, and doing this procedure at home. This method is called in-home pet euthanasia. I have chosen this recourse when I put my awesome Leonberger Nadja to sleep in 2013, I Love You Nadja! And just a little over a week ago, when I truly believe that The Kaya Baby and myself came to an understanding, and knew what had to be done, I called CodaPet, who put me in touch with Dr. Lauren Silvesti. Everyone who I talked with at CodaPet were so kind, respectful, and professional and my words cannot express how highly I exalt Dr. Lauren Silvesti. From our very first interaction on Wednesday morning, she was compassionate, kind, and accessible. Dr. Lauren Silvesti was willing to answer any questions that I had throughout the day, and whenever I tried to get in touch with her, she was available. Kaya was such an amazing girl who had vastly intense energy. She could be stubborn and mischievous and I loved her for it. Principally though, Kaya was loving and sensitive. She could not tolerate any tension or drama, so I did my best to make sure that she wouldn’t have to. If I had decided to take Kaya to a veterinary hospital to allow her to pass on, then there would have been a lot of added stress for her. I would never allow that to happen. Kaya was a very family oriented girl, so the only option for both of us, was to do this procedure at home. Kaya passed away in my arms while I was hugging her and talking to her. My mom and dad were also there, as well as my sister and brother in-law, along with their two dogs Luney and Ruby. They are both Kaya’s sisters, and everyone who was there loved Kaya so much. I was with my Kaya girl for the whole time, and I sincerely believe that she was at peace. Having to make the decision “when is the right time?” And having to say goodbye to all of my dogs, is by far one of the hardest things that I will have to go through in my life. Dr. Lauren Silvesti made this experience as manageable as possible for all of us. She was so professional, and from beginning to end, the procedure was conducted smoothly, effectively, and tenderly. Thank You Dr. Silvesti! I believe it meant the world to Kaya to have so many people who loved her, there with her, when she needed it most. The Kaya Baby was so full of love, and she loved everybody who was there with her also. RIP Baby Girl and Best Wishes on your next adventure! Also to Baxter, Ruffo, Mila, Dreyfus, and Nadja, I miss you guys and I love you! If you happen to be reading this review and you are going through this agonizing time of saying goodbye to your dog. I wanted to say I’m sorry and I’m sending my heartfelt condolences. I genuinely recommend CodaPet out of Ashburn, Virginia, and Dr. Lauren Silvesti, who I will forever consider a dear friend. They specialize at in-home pet euthanasia, which is a truly valuable service. If there is an option to take this course of action when the time is right, in my opinion it is the best way to go, for the wellbeing of your pet. I’m sending everyone my love and please cherish your time with your pets. Time flies by so fast and life is too short. Sincerely and Respectfully, Jussi Sletzinger

> Dr. Lauren Silvesti helped us through the heart-breaking process of letting go of our sweet, 17-year-old terrier, Brandy, in our home. From our final decision-making up through sending her to Heaven, Dr. Silvesti emanated compassion, understanding and empathy which made the process peaceful and bearable. We couldn't be more grateful nor recommend her more highly. Thank you! Sally Gannon

> I recently had to say goodbye to one of my pets, and I wanted to take a moment to share my gratitude for the incredible kindness and compassion shown by Dr Silvesti. From the moment she arrived, she brought with her a calming presence. She spoke to me softly, she moved gently and she was patient - absolutely nothing was rushed. She truly gave me the time and space I needed to say goodbye - in my own time. What meant the most was how she worked around me. I didn’t want to let go of my pet during the process, and she respected that fully, allowing me to hold my pet in my arms the entire time. She explained everything and never once did I feel pressured or uncomfortable. There was no sense of guilt, no judgment — only compassion and understanding at a time when I definitely needed it. We all too often turn the pain and hurt inward, looking for fault and taking the blame, but she didn’t let me do that to myself. I know I’m not alone in the heartbreak of losing a pet, and I know my experience is not more unique or more painful than anyone else’s, but it makes such a difference when someone takes the time to truly care. Dr Silvesti did that, and I will always be grateful. I will recommend CODA to anyone facing this difficult moment because of their service and empathy during such a difficult time. Thank you Dr Silvesti! \- Nancye Lewis

> Dr. Lauren was absolutely lovely from the moment she arrived at our house. She was very thoughtful with every interaction, discussion, etc. She patiently explained the steps to my very curious children (ages ranging 5-10 years old) and entertained their request for a fur keepsake from their beloved doggy. We didn’t have much time to get our at-home appointment scheduled but I feel like we were lucky to get Dr. Lauren when we did, she made us feel very comfortable to carry on with our emotions without a second thought.
