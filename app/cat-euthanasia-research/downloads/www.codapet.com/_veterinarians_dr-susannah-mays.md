Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

From a young age I have always felt a strong connection with animals. As I progressed in school, I was fascinated and excelled in biology and science, so choosing a career in veterinary medicine was a natural choice. I believe that every animal deserves compassionate care and I strive to provide the highest standard of care to all of my patients. After years of providing emergency care for pets in Memphis, I chose to extend my practice to include in-home euthanasia. Recognizing the emotional and sensitive nature of end-of-life decisions for pets, I wanted to offer a more comfortable and familiar environment for both the animals and their owners during this difficult time. By providing in-home euthanasia, I aim to create a peaceful and compassionate atmosphere, allowing pets to be surrounded by their loved ones in the comfort of their own homes. I believe that this personalized approach not only helps ease the emotional burden for pet owners but also ensures a more peaceful transition for the pet, allowing them to say goodbye in a calm and familiar setting.

> We knew the day was coming when we would have to make the difficult decision to let our sweet Abby go. We have had many dogs over the years and did not know that compassionate in-home euthanasia was an option until recently. When we knew Abby’s time was imminent, after much prayer, I made the appointment. We wanted Abby to have a calm and peaceful departure on her terms, not go out experiencing severe anxiety. I’ve read that it’s better to be a week early, rather than a day late when considering euthanasia. Thanks to Dr. Susannah Mays, Abby was able to leave this world peacefully laying in my arms. The overall experience for our family was exceptional. Dr. Mays contacted me and assured me that if we changed our mind, it would be ok. Hearing that somehow gave me comfort knowing that if a miracle happened and Abby got better, we could cancel. The day before the appointment, our beloved 16+ year old, very ill Abby girl let us know that she was ready to go. On the day of our appointment, Dr. Mays texted as a reminder and arrived promptly with kind words and wanted to know all about our sweet old pup. Dr. Mays showed such compassion and kindness to us and to Abby. Dr. Mays explained the procedure, we signed the consent and as Abby was sleeping in my arms, she was able to receive the medications without even knowing. Abby didn’t flinch and was gone in a few minutes with no pain, no anxiety, no emergency and no panicking family members. We wish we had known earlier that there was a better way to let your beloved pet die in peace. We will always be eternally grateful for the compassionate care Dr. Mays gave to Abby and to us as a family. Dr. Mays is blessed and has a special calling for the work she does and we were blessed to be able to experience that in real life. Thank you Dr. Mays. You make a difference in the lives of pets and the folks who love them to the end.

> Dr. Mays was so kind and caring with my Charlie. She took her time to explain everything and to make sure I was comfortable with what was happening and that Charlie’s passing was peaceful and painless. I couldn’t have asked for better care anywhere and the fact that she came to our home so I didn’t have to put the stress and pain of a car ride on my 18 year old baby meant the would to me.

> Having to make the decision to let our pet companions go is the worst emotional experience. I have had to do this 4 times before and have always had an in office euthanasia. With my latest dog Titus we chose a peaceful passing at home with Dr. Susannah Mays. From the first initial phone call to the last day I experienced nothing but compassion and empathy. Dr. Mays was amazing in understanding our grief and needs. She explained everything along the process. She gave us the time we needed to say goodbye. As sorrowful as it was to say goodbye it was also the most beautiful experience letting my Titus pass at home. Titus was surrounded by his family and we were able to comfort and love him til the end. I will always choose an at home passing in the future. I highly recommend Dr. Mays and CodaPet. They did everything with the highest quality of care and compassion.

> This was our first experience with in-home euthanasia and would highly recommend it. Your fur baby is where they want to be and are surrounded with love and calm. Our Radley had gone down fast over the last month and we had an appt scheduled for a Friday morning. He woke up the Wednesday before, which happened to be New Year’s Eve, and couldn’t hardly walk. Seemed like a stroke or something of that nature. I sent a video to Dr. Mays and asked if there was any way she could come that day. She checked her schedule and worked with us so that our sweet boy didn’t have to suffer much longer. She came out early afternoon on New Year’s Eve and helped us ease our sweet Radley across the Rainbow Bridge. We are forever grateful for her professionalism, kindness and empathy.

> This service went above and beyond my expectations. From the ease of the online booking to the exceptional care my pet and I received. Dr. Mays was amazing, very caring, educational and empathetic in the most difficult time. I have no doubts I made the right decision about using this service vs taking to the vet. Additionally, the box for the ashes, the clay paw print and the imprints Dr. Mays did were perfect.

> Saying goodbye to my beloved pup was one of the hardest days of my life, and I will always be grateful that Dr. Susannah was there with us. She was so thoughtful and kind throughout the entire process, showing deep compassion not only for my dog but also for me. Her gentle manner and patience helped make an incredibly painful experience feel peaceful and dignified. She took the time to explain everything with care, reassured me when I needed it, and treated my pup with such respect and tenderness. I cannot thank Dr. Susannah enough for her compassion on that day.

> Dr. Mays is a wonderful doctor. She never made us feel rushed in the process of putting our beloved family dog down, and answered all of our questions so we truly understood the process and what to expect. Having her come to our home for the euthanasia was so much more peaceful than taking him to the vet, and we will always choose this option with her moving forward. Thank you Dr. Mays for everything you do, you made this decision much less stressful for us, my family truly appreciates it!

> Dr. Susannah Mays was heaven sent as she provided gentle, peaceful, compassionate, in-home euthanasia to our beloved dog, Abby. Our local vet supported Abby in having a good long life, but when we knew it was time to let her go, we wanted a peaceful, calm and loving exit for both Abby and our family. After much research and prayer, we decided on CodaPet. Abby was able to lay on my chest, peacefully sleeping, while Dr. Mays carefully and professionally put her to sleep. I wish I had known about in-home compassionate euthanasia with all our other dogs. It truly was a blessing to all of us to have found Dr. Mays. No fear or anxiety for Abby, and a calm, gentle end for us. It was technologically easy to schedule through the CodaPet website. Dr. Mays contacted me right away and offered comforting and encouraging words as she knew how difficult it would be to say goodbye to our beloved pet. Dr. Mays kept in touch and on the scheduled day, she arrived promptly and gently inquired about our life with Abby. Overall, Dr. Mays made one of the worst days a treasured memory knowing that Abby went out on her own terms. No words can express our gratitude.
