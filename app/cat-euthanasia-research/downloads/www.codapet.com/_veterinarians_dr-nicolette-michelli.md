Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

When I was in high school, I was required to perform mandatory service hours. I started volunteering at a local stable and took care of all the horses, led trail rides, farm tours, etc. I decided I wanted to be able to give back to these animals that help us every day. I majored in Animal Sciences while in undergrad and then worked as a small animal surgery and anesthesia technician while awaiting my vet school acceptance. Originally, I went to veterinary school to specialize in equine sports medicine and radiology and I even completed an equine internship post-graduation. However, while I will still continue to work on horses, I would like to be able to give back to the community. Six months before starting vet school, I had to put down my beloved family rescue dog that I had for 10 years. She was terrified of everyone besides my mom and I, and she hated being in a vet office. Having to put her to sleep in a strange room surrounded by strange people was horrible. I would like to offer my services in order to help your furry friend cross the rainbow bridge in their own safe space, surrounded by the people they love.

## What pet parents are saying

> I couldn’t have found a better person than Dr. Michelli from CodaPet to bring our baby her forever nap. This was the first time ever having to do this and she told us everything to be expected and was so kind and compassionate to us and Sable. Thank you Dr. Michelle and CodaPet for bringing our doggie peace and making this difficult task just a little bit easier. I’m so glad we decided to have this done at home in her safe place rather than then at the veterinary office where she typically has anxiety.

> Dr. Michelli was the most caring person during this difficult time. She loved on our pups, listened to all of our stories about her through the process and cried with us. It made the event easier to process through our grief. She is an amazing person to do what she does.

> Dr. Nicolette Michelli was a sweet and kind person to my family and I. Most importantly she treated our sweet girl Nena with respect and love. It was our first time ever going through euthanasia with any of our pets, and Dr. Nicolette Michelli explained the process in a clear and respectful manner whilst being attentive to our sweet girl. She always made sure to check in with us throughout the process and gave us the time we needed to say our final goodbyes. The experience is now a fond memory for me, because our sweet Nena was able to rest surrounded by family and with dignity. I was able to book the service the same day that we needed it. Dr. Nicolette Michelli checked in with me prior and after the service which I really appreciated 💕

> Dr. Michelli made our hard day much easier. She explained everything with such delicate detail. Just her demeanor was so calming. I feel like she was placed perfectly for us. It was a heartbreaking day but she gave us the peace we needed. I wouldn't do it any other way and glad our baby got to go over the rainbow bridge in our own home.

> Thank you for what you do. Letting go of our Molly was extremely difficult but we knew it was time since her illness had taken away her quality of life. I am grateful your service was available for my Molly. She was always afraid at the vet and I didn’t want her final moments in this world to be scary for her. She was able to be home, in her bed, without fear. It’s the best last thing I could give her and I will be forever grateful for the ability to do that for her. Your are an amazing and caring vet and I would recommend you to anyone who asks. Thank you for what you do. My family and I will forever be thankful for you.

> We cannot thank Dr. Nicolette Michelli enough for the compassion, kindness, and grace she showed our family during one of the hardest moments of our lives. From the moment she arrived, her calm presence and genuine empathy brought us comfort during an incredibly emotional time. Choosing in-home euthanasia allowed our beloved pet to remain in a familiar, peaceful environment, surrounded by love, and Dr. Michelli handled every step with such tenderness and respect. She took the time to explain the process, never rushed us, and treated our pet with the dignity they deserved. It was clear how deeply she cares—not just about animals, but about the families who love them. This is not an easy role, and it takes a truly special person to provide this kind of care with so much compassion. We will forever be grateful to Dr. Michelli for helping our sweet companion pass so peacefully and for giving us a moment of calm and closure during such a heartbreaking goodbye. We wholeheartedly recommend her to anyone facing this difficult decision.

> Dr Nicolette is heaven sent. She made this very heartbreaking experience a peaceful one and made the grieving process gentler with her kindness and overwhelming care and love for what she does. I don’t think I could have coped with this great loss if anyone else had done it. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for the love and care you showed Bran and our family.

> Dr. Nicolette Michelli truly made the difference for us. Having to say goodbye to a family member will always be heartbreaking, but the peaceful manner in which we were able to do it brought us a lot of comfort. Dr. Michelli was kind and gentle in her communications and presence. She made herself fully available before and after. Her manner made the process easy and she had great advice for how to handle our other pups saying goodbye. There were a lot of little things she did and offered that showed how considerate and caring she is of our pets and family. It really touched us that she continued to pet our Dacoda even after she passed. We were able to say goodbye as Dacoda slept in our lap, paws in the grass and sun shining on her fur. We would highly recommend if anyone is considering.

> Dr. Michelli was a wonderful doctor who assisted us in giving a peaceful and loving goodbye to our beloved dog of 16 years, Jasmine. She responded very quickly after we booked the appointment and messaged us with all the necessary information and answered any questions we had about the procedure. When she arrived to our home, she was very quiet, respectful and understanding of our grief. She allowed us all the time we needed to compose ourselves and say our last goodbyes before we parted with our beautiful little dog. She explained all the steps and procedures very well and allowed our sweet dog to pass gently in her sleep in the comfort of our home. I cannot reccomend Dr. Michelli's services enough. She made an already painful process easy, gentle, and peaceful. We are thankful we contacted her to give our sweet Jasmine a final goodbye.

> This was a new experience for me. I’ve had pets pass, but it was always done at my local animal hospital. This time, for my soul cat (you know, that one animal that enters your life and they become so deeply attached to you, and you to them) I wanted him to pass at home in my arms. Dr. Michelli was amazing. She is so calm, caring, and understanding. She gave me all the time I needed in between steps to say goodbye and love on my boy. He went to sleep in my arms as I wanted (and as I needed). This was what my boy deserved, and I glad I chose Codapet vs going into a vet. I highly recommend Codapet and Dr Michelli . I give her 10 out of 5 stars. Thank you Dr Michelli ⭐️
