About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

Growing up I was surrounded by animals and the industries involved in helping animals lead good lives and remain healthy. When I am with animals, I am happy. I have always had a calling to care for things. It is what drives me. It is what makes me feel like I am doing something good in the world.

> The most compassionate experience. Our boy didn't like the vet, or a leash, so having Dr. Klepper come to us so he could stay in his yard was definitely what my soul needed to say goodbye. Thank you, Dr. K. I cannot express our gratitude for the peaceful passing.
