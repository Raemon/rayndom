Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

My journey as a veterinarian started way back into my childhood as I cared for many stray animals, some of which became my personal pets. That early experience with animals had left a sizable impression on me as I went through high school and college, loving life sciences and medicine, then having to make the choice between human and veterinary medicine. My love and compassion to be with and help animals won me over to be a veterinarian.

## What pet parents are saying

> Dr. Doss made my Molly's transition a smooth one. He allowed me to take time to grieve and was patient with me. I could tell that he was very empathetic to my pain and CodaPet is a fantastic organization that went above and beyond the standard for what one may expect in a more clinical setting. Thank you so very much to both for helping me through this time of sorrow.

> Dr Doss was great. He came to our house on Saturday, March 29th...very last minute. We were devastated. He took the time to go over our dog's medical history and assured us that we were making the right decision. He was patient and beyond caring. We have 2 kids and this was the only pet they have known. She was a member of our family. Dr Doss made the passing very painless for our beloved Mimi.

> Our fur baby of 9years had cancer and the inevitable time came where we had to make a choice. We found CodaPet and Dr Doss was so compassionate and tender during this process of grief. Bubba got to go to sleep forever here at home around all whom loved him. I wouldnt have it any other way and definitely would use their services again for any of my fur babies (i have 3 left). They took care of everything including services for Bubba and we had his ashes back home in 48 hours. Its never goodbye always see u later. All Dogs go to heaven .

> Dr. Doss was great. Caring and gentle. I would recommend him for the passing of your pet. It was the first time I'd ever put down a pet and as horrible as it was Dr. Doss made it less painful I feel.
