Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

In all the roles I've had in veterinary medicine, the part I found most fulfilling was supporting animals and their owners through end-of-life care. I have been doing hospice work for over 10 years and truly find it an honor to provide a peaceful, pain-free transition for beloved companions.

> So many “Thank You’s” to Dr. Dover and the service she provides. From the moment I scheduled our appointment, Dr. Dover communicated with me about ETA’s, what to expect from the at-home euthanasia process, and advice for post euthanasia processes as well. She was incredibly personable and compassionate to both my family and our dear late Kitty.

> It was so very hard to have to decide to euthanize my seriously ill dog, who was a friend I had for 12 years. I am so grateful for how it was handled by CodaPet and the excellent veterinarian, Dr. Dover, who came to my home. She had thoughtfully answered my questions when I made the appointment. She even was able to come earlier than scheduled when my dog took a sudden turn for the worse. Every detail of the process was carefully thought out and explained to me.

> We had to say our final goodbyes to our Spanky girl last week. Dr. Dover made the process of in home euthanasia as smooth as it possibly could be. This is never an experience anyone wants to have but will be calling her again for any other in the future. She made us feel so comfortable and I wouldn’t have had it any other way than in our own home. Highly recommend her to anyone!

> While Dr. Andrea did get us through the process, after speaking with my partner, we’d be remiss not to leave some gentle feedback suggesting some additional attention be paid to overall bedside manner and conversation tone and style. We were clearly in deep emotional distress and Dr. Andrea simply wasn’t a match for the type of care/support we needed. However as a Vet she performed her technical function.

We weren’t quite ready to say goodbyes to Denni, but felt we gave her the best farewell possible thanks to Dr. Dover. If you’re able to offer your pet the in-home option, I would highly recommend CODA and Dr. Dover.

> We lost Lily on Feb 11th. Dr Andrea Dover assisted us through one of the more devestating nights that comes to recent memory. Lily passed away from a cancer that was highly aggressive and we didn't see it coming. She was just 9. Dr Andrea came and she was so easy and comfortable to have in our home she felt like just another member or friend of our family and I can't imagine how we would have gotten through it without her. She let us know exactly what would happen before it did and gave us all the room and space we needed to let Lily go and treated her with such kindness and dignity. We were incredibly blessed to have her assist Lily with her end of life care. Thank you so much. 💓 Don And Dawn Leland

> There are not enough words to describe how helpful Dr Dover was to me and my soul dog Stella. I was in a difficult situation and finding no hope anywhere. I made many phone calls to several area Veterinary clinics and spoke to many professionals, and still was left with no answers or solutions. Then I met Dr Dover who not only helped me, but walked me through it with kindness and compassion. She didn’t give up when issues came up. She went above and beyond. I really could not be more grateful for her during this time. I’m grateful for her knowledge, professionalism, and willingness to help those of us who don’t always fit in the box, and being an extraordinary human being.

> If I could leave 10 stars I would. I had a 16 year old yorkie that I have been holding onto hoping that he would just pass away in the middle of the night peacefully in his sleep and when I wake up he would be in heaven. Unfortunately things never go the way we hoped for. My poor Romeo has been trying to show me/tell me for awhile now that he’s ready, The last 2 months I seen a complete decline and finally found enough courage and strength to bring him into see his Vet. I rescued Romeo in November 2009. He was 9 months and I was 19 years old. Fast forward to today and he is now 16 years and a few months old and I’m now 35. So you can only imagine the attachment that I had for him. I guess I already knew it was time but I needed confirmation or validation. I guess if someone that is experienced tells me it’s time then it won’t have to necessarily be my choice lol this was my thought process. I knew that I didn’t want to do it in a clinic. So I went home that night and called around for estimates and to feel people out and see who felt right. I stumbled upon CodaPet after I had made a few calls to other places but I just didn’t feel right. When I read their page and saw Dr.Dover and her information, without even talking to her first I knew for some reason that she was the one that needed to do it. Well my intuition was absolutely right. I couldn’t have asked for a better veterinarian to come in to our home and help my little man cross over the rainbow bridge. She was absolutely amazing, professional, compassionate, understanding and respectful. I mean I could go on and on. I’m not a very emotional person, I would say that I handle death a lot better than most. I knew I’d be sad and I would cry, of course but I was not expecting the kind of pain that I felt when I had to say goodbye. So I believe that it is important who you choose to come into your own and share that kind of deep personal experience with and I’m just so grateful that I chose her to come in and take care of my little Romeo like she did. She was super thorough, she was mindful and sat us down before she did anything and explained the process. I have never experienced this before so it was a little scary I’m not going to lie. However, all that went away moments after her arrival. She had this calmness about her that made me feel safe. You can tell she is very passionate about what she does. I am a CNA that works in home hospice for old people, so in a way we kind of have the Same job but she does it for animals, I do it for people however of course I’m not putting people into a forever sleep, obviously. But I know first hand that it takes a special person to go around and do what she does. If you have any doubts about your fur baby, I strongly strongly recommend getting in touch with Dr.Dover and talking to her about options. I promise you won’t regret it and you will instantly feel that she’s the best veterinarian for this job. I love that she didn’t treat it like a “job.” The other places that I called just seemed like they were just out to completely drain my pockets to kill my dog and I did NOT like that. But Dr.Dover was far from anything like that. It was absolutely a good feeling knowing that my Romeo was in good Hands. Dr.Dover- I can’t thank you enough for everything you did for me and my little man last night. I know that he’s up there running through fields being wild and is no longer suffering and most likely sniffin out and eating all the bacon his little heart desires. You made it peaceful and special. I can’t thank you enough. No need to search any longer, you have found the perfect Veterinarian. Don’t hesitate or allow your fur baby to suffer any longer!! Godbless Julia Dillard

> Concerns: The process felt rushed to me. Dr. Dover gave my dog TWICE the amount of sedative and pain med for her weight. My dog weighed 12 lbs. and she said gave Chili twice the amount for her weight - enough for a 25 lb. dog. Why? To hurry things along so she could go to her next appointment? Also, Dr. Dover was wearing heavy cologne. Many people are sensitive and/or allergic to fragrances. Disappointing that she’d wear so much fragrance. It lingered in the house long after she was gone.

> It is such an emotional time when you have to put your beloved pet down. I thought and prayed hard when my little pup Rocky wasn't getting well; he was only getting worse. After signing up online, I was contacted right away, by Dr Andrea Dover. She was able to come when I chose, only a day or two later. She was so good with Rocky. He was totally comfortable with her. After initial consultation, I carried Rocky to my bed, which I thought would provide maximum comfort and relaxation. I held him as he lay there, staring close into his sweet face. I talked to him the whole time, as Dr Dover administered the injections. Rocky didn't seem to notice Dr Dover was there or doing anything. I was free to coddle him and talk to him, and he was listening. We were truly at one during this process. I didn't want to get overly upset, and just let the tears flow as I gave him love, smiles of reassurance and promises to see him again in heaven. Afterward, Dr Dover gently gathered him in a soft blanket and placed him in a perfect-sized basket. Rocky was at peace, his sweet little face looked like he was sleeping, all warm and cozy in the blanket imprinted with hearts. It was so hard to let him go, but there couldn't have been a better way. Dr Andrea is very intuitive, gentle, and kind. She appeared to me very God-centered in her work. I was so grateful that it was her there with me. It's been tough, but lately I have been having exquisite dreams of Rocky running to me, just like he used to do when he was well. He's all excited to see me, full of energy, having fun and feeling so happy. I think that's a good sign. I believe my little Pumpkin (which I often called him), is at peace now and one day we will be together again. Last night, I dreamt I was offering him a bowl of pumpkin!

> I recommend Dr.Dover 1000%! I had to put my baby boy Romeo down after 16 years. He was with me when I was 19 and I’m now 35. He was 9 months old and a rescue when I rescued him in 2009. May 1st 2025 is the day I put my baby boy (Yorkie) to rest so as you can probably understand I wanted to make sure he was comfortable and he was able to pass in the comfort of his own home. I was hoping that he would pass away on his own but his Vet said that it was time. I called around to a few places for at home euthanasia but my heart just didn’t feel right until I found Coda pet. I was a little nervous because it wasn’t just putting a pet or animal to forever sleep, it was putting one of your family to forever sleep. So I didn’t know if bringing in a stranger would stop me from giving up the best goodbye and I didn’t want to hold back, but the moment Dr.Dover walked through my door I felt a sense of comfort and relief. She was very thorough, kind, patient and talked me through each step of the way. During the process she would periodically check in to make sure that me and my family were ok. She gave us a safe space and I couldn’t have asked for a better person to help take my baby boy over the rainbow bridge. He passed away peacefully in my arms. She let me know it was ok if I took hours or even just minutes to say goodbye. I didn’t feel rushed, judged, or scared. She talked to Romeo like he was a person and not just some animal. She was gracious, loving, caring and thoughtful. If you have any doubts, look no further, because Dr.Dover is the one. It takes a special kind of soul to do the work she does and I know because I work in hospice care and you can tell her soul is beautiful! She was so compassionate and definitely made me feel like I was doing the right thing. she validated me and made any guilt I felt, go away. My husband felt the same and we would and will definitely use her again. Thank you Dr.Dover for all that you do, you have a heart of gold and have touched our lives with your grace. We will never forget the beautiful goodbye you gave to me and my baby boy.

> Last month, Dr. Dover helped us say goodbye to our beloved Satya, who has been with us for the last 21+ years. She lived a long and beautiful life, enriching our lives in every imaginable way, and she is deeply missed every moment of every day. We were truly grateful to be able to offer her a loving and peaceful passing in the comfort of our arms in her home. Dr. Dover was compassionate, kind, and caring. While my heart goes out to anyone who is in need of this service, I can genuinely say that I would recommend Dr. Dover without hesitation. I am so grateful for this gift of being able to ease our sweet Satya's suffering in a way that honored who she was and remains in our hearts.

Not only did she go out of her way to come to our house after 8:00 pm on a Friday night, (changing our appointment that we had for Saturday afternoon), but she was also very compassionate and supportive. She gave us as much time as we needed to say our goodbyes and she was very loving to our sweet boy as he transitioned to his journey over the rainbow bridge. Thank you so very much Dr. Dover for your support and the hug you gave me afterwards. Your kindness didn’t go unnoticed.

> We knew when our 16-year-old whippet, Reyna, was near her end, that we wanted to use in home euthanasia, so she would be comfortable and not afraid. Dr. Dover was so kind to us and Reyna, and so skilled with the process that it was peaceful and calm, and not at all scary or stressful. It was a good way for us to say goodbye to her (and Reyna enjoyed the special treats we gave her beforehand.) This is how we'd do it when we need to again.

> She was very comforting and made an extremely difficult situation easier than expected. Explained the process before hand and while each step was taken. When we rescued Chapo, we knew he would only be around for a Few years, we never expected it to be less than two. While, it was an extremely difficult decision to make I knew he was suffering and at the same time knew My family and myself had given him more love in two years than he had experienced his entire life. She was very understanding and supported the extra family friends that we had present and made my sons choice to leave after the serum and before the lethal Injection much more comprehensive to him. Highly recommend.

> Dr.Dover came to our house to help our little dog Toby, pass peacefully. Dr. Dover is a wonderful mix of kindness, compassion and professionalism. She walked us through the process and once we got started, the process was as peaceful as a heart shattering procedure can be. She was always very considerate of Toby's comfort even in passing. She took a goodly amount of time in between processes to insure gentle transition. At the very end, Dr. Dover gave us time alone with Toby before she took him. She carefully and lovingly placed him in the sweetest basket and tucked him in, ready for his last ride. She took him to the crematorium for us. Dr. Dover was everything compassionate and kindness to the very end. We highly recommend at home services and Codapet. We could set the surroundings the way we wanted. So much better than a clinical experience. Thank you Dr. Dover. 💔

> When the time came to let our 14 year old male Husky pass on we knew that we wanted to do so at home in a familiar setting, where he'd feel as stress free as possible. Our other 2 dogs had been euthanized in vet clinics - the somewhat chaotic settings were stressful & somewhat traumatizing. CodaPet employees were respectful of our needs in assisting us with scheduling & any questions we had. Dr. Andrea Dover was fantastic & put us at ease throughout the entire visit. She didn't rush us, answered any questions thoughtfully & is extremely kind. We chose to transport our pet ourselves to Peaceful Paws for cremation. Dr. Dover had high praise for them as well as their employee Aaron, who was fantastic also. I highly recommend both to anyone that finds themselves in the same situation with their beloved family pet.
