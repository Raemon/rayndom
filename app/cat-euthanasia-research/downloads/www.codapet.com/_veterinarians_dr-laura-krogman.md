> For our beloved dog, mama, we knew she need to be set free at home. We kind of knew what to expect, but Dr. Krogman talked with us about mama's life and how she came into it, and that made the experience meaningful. Thank you Dr. Krogman for your help in such a hard time.

> Dear Dr. Krogman, I just wanted to take a moment to thank you from the bottom of my heart for the kindness, grace, and patience you showed my husband and me as we said goodbye to our sweet Milton. You handled everything with such compassion and respect, and I was truly in awe of your ability to guide us through such a difficult moment with clarity and care. Most importantly, you put Milton’s needs first, ensuring he was comfortable and at peace every step of the way. Knowing that he was free from pain and surrounded by love gave us the reassurance we needed in an otherwise heartbreaking moment. Your presence brought us a sense of peace and closure, helping us know without a doubt that we were making the best decision for our best little buddy. I am so incredibly grateful for you and the work you do. In that moment, you felt like an angel in disguise, and I will never forget the kindness you showed us and Milton. With heartfelt gratitude, Kelly and Mark Freel

> Dr. Laura Krogman shared her heart with us as she walked us through the most difficult moment. Her tenderness and genuine compassion helped us get through losing our precious pup. He passed into eternity on his favorite blanket, on his favorite sofa, and surrounded by his family. This experience was hard, but Dr. Laura made it (dare I say) beautiful. We are forever grateful! Thank you with all our hearts!

> We had to make the heartbreaking decision to euthanize our sweet pup, The Dude, last week, and Dr. Laura Krogman was phenomenal in making the process as peaceful and loving as possible. She was compassionate, kind, sympathetic, and very professional, and she allowed us the opportunity to watch our pup cross the rainbow bridge while he was content and snuggled on his own bed in front of the fire place, enjoying special loves and treats. We will forever be grateful to her, and we will happily recommend her to all our family friends.

> Dr. Laura Krogman made an extremely hard and difficult time for us and our pup so much more bearable by providing in home pet euthanasia. I could not imagine either my family or our sweet Ollie having to go through this in a vet’s office. I am so thankful to friends that had told us about this option and I am so thankful to Dr Laura for being part of our journey.

> We are heartbroken after losing our beautiful little Bebe. She had several cancerous tumors. We didn't want her to suffer anymore and the tumors were inoperable. We found Codapet through our vet’s recommendation for in-home pet euthanasia. Dr. Laura Krogman was so kind and gentle. I could not do her job but I’m glad she is so capable and willing to ease our grief just a bit.

> Review for Dr. Laura Krogman I cannot express enough gratitude for Dr. Laura Krogman and the compassionate care she provided during one of the most difficult moments of our lives. Saying goodbye to our sweet 14-year-old dog, Milton, was heartbreaking, but Dr. Laura made the process as peaceful and comfortable as possible—for him and for us. From the moment she arrived, her professionalism and empathy were evident. Her bedside manner was truly remarkable, and her timing throughout the process was perfect. She ensured that Milton experienced no anxiety or discomfort, allowing him to be at ease in his own home. Having been through this process before, I can say without a doubt that having it done at home made a world of difference. Dr. Laura was truly an angel in our time of need, and I will forever be grateful for her kindness. I would highly recommend her to anyone facing this difficult decision. She is a rare and special soul who provides a level of care and compassion that is beyond measure. Thank you!
