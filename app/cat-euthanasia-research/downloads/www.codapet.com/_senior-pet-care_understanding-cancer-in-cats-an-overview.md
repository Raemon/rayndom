# Understanding Cancer In Cats: An Overview

[Dr. Karen Whala](/experts/dr-karen-whala)

October 15, 2024

Cancer in cats, like in humans, involves abnormal cell growth that can lead to various tumors. Common types include lymphoma, mammary tumors, and fibrosarcoma. Early signs may be subtle—such as weight loss, behavioral changes, or lumps—making regular vet check-ups crucial. Treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy, and supportive care, with early detection significantly improving outcomes. Environmental factors, age, genetics, and lifestyle can influence cancer risks, highlighting the importance of proactive care for your feline friend.

## **Defining Cancer in Cats**

Just like humans, cats also get cancer, which is characterized by abnormal cell growth. Under normal circumstances, cells in a cat's body grow, divide, die, and are replaced by new cells. However, when these cells become damaged yet continue to grow and divide, it can lead to the development of tumors. According to estimates, approximately 6 million cats in the United States alone are diagnosed with cancer each year. Furthermore, between 53 to 83% of tumors found in cats are malignant or cancerous. The survival rate of cats diagnosed with cancer greatly depends on the type of cancer, whether it has spread to other parts of the body, and the overall health of the cat. We understand how devastating a cancer diagnosis can be for pet parents, and we are here to provide support and guidance during these challenging times.

## **Common Types of Cancer in Cats**

Cats can develop several types of malignant cancer, each affecting different parts of their bodies.

  * Lymphoma, for instance, is the most common type of cancer in cats, affecting white blood cells called lymphocytes and lymphoid tissues found throughout the body.
  * Mastocytoma, or mast cell tumors, which develop from mast cells made in the bone marrow and often develop in the skin or spleen in cats.
  * Leiomyosarcoma is a rare but painful type of soft tissue cancer that affects muscles in the stomach and intestines.
  * Fibrosarcoma affects soft tissues such as muscle and connective tissue and tends to spread slowly but can be locally aggressive.
  * Mammary tumors, also known as breast cancer, affecting the tissue surrounding a cat’s nipples, are aggressive tumors that generally spread to nearby lymph nodes and the lungs.
  * Osteosarcoma is bone cancer that affects the skeleton of cats and is locally aggressive and painful.
  * Ceruminous gland adenocarcinoma develops in a cat’s sweat glands and often occurs in the ear canal.
  * Melanomas are often isolated, raised masses that may bleed and can affect many parts of the body, including the mouth, skin, and eyes.
  * Myeloproliferative neoplasms are a type of blood cancer that originates from the bone marrow.
  * Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common skin tumor in cats and grows rapidly. Most often affecting nonpigmented areas of the skin such as the bridge of the nose and ears.
  * Hemangiosarcoma is a fast-growing tumor that develops from blood vessel cells and may cause internal bleeding, often affecting the spleen.
  * Lastly, Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) is a tumor that grows in the bladder of cats and is locally aggressive.



## **Signs and Symptoms of Cancer in Cats**

Cats, which are considered both a prey and predator, are skilled at concealing their discomfort or illness, often not showing signs until much later stages of a disease development. As pet parents, it's important to notice subtleties in behavior or any physical alterations. Worthy of attention are symptoms such as:

  * **Changes in lumps or sores:** If you notice any lumps on your cat's body that change in size or appear to become sores, it's a sign to be concerned about.
  * **Alteration in fur texture:** A previously smooth coat turning rough or unkempt can indicate health issues.
  * **Variations in energy and mobility:** Is your furry friend less active? Do they show signs of stiffness, or have they experienced rapid weight changes—either gaining or losing?
  * **Eating habits and vomiting:** A decrease in appetitive or persistent vomiting, along with trouble eating, should raise red flags.
  * **Litter box habits:** An increase in the difficulty of passing urine or feces or changes such as regularly ‘missing’ the litterbox can be a subtle change that may warrant further investigation.
  * **Respiratory issues and odors:** Difficulty breathing or an unusual smell from the mouth could be symptoms.



Spotting these signs early on and seeking immediate veterinary guidance is critical. It can lead to early detection, which is pivotal for successful intervention. Prompt veterinary care are essential components of identifying early stages of disease and cancer. It's about trusting your instincts and acting swiftly for the welfare of your cherished companion.

## **Factors Contributing to Cat's Cancer**

### Age and Cat's Cancer

Age is the most significant factor when it comes to the development of cancer in cats. As cats grow older, their vulnerability to cancer increases, which underscores the importance of vigilant care for aging felines. Regular veterinary check-ups become even more essential for senior cats, as these appointments can lead to the early detection of cancers and other ailments. Detecting cancer early can markedly improve the prognosis and may increase the success rate of treatments available. For senior cats, keeping a watchful eye on any shifts in behavior or physical health can help ensure that they live comfortable lives. It's our commitment to support pet parents in recognizing these signs and understanding the benefits of preventative health measures for their cherished companions.

### Environmental Factors

Environmental factors can play a significant role in the development of cancer in cats. Exposure to toxins in the environment, such as certain chemicals or secondhand smoke, can potentially increase the risk of cancer. Additionally, viruses such as the feline leukemia virus have been linked to certain types of cancer in cats. Therefore, it's essential to keep your cat's living environment clean and safe, minimizing their exposure to potential toxins. Regular vaccinations can also help protect against viruses linked to cancer.

### Genetic Predilection

Certain breeds of cats may have a predisposition to specific types of cancer, which is influenced by their genetic makeup. This doesn't mean that cancer is unavoidable for these breeds, but it highlights the significance of being proactive in monitoring their health. Recognizing your cat's genetic predispositions can empower you as a pet owner to take early and appropriate measures to manage their well-being. Alongside this knowledge, regular veterinary check-ups are essential. They provide opportunities for health screenings that can detect any genetic markers indicative of cancer. Early detection means early intervention, which can be pivotal in managing your cat's health effectively.

### Diet and Lifestyle

Diet and lifestyle have a significant impact on your cat's overall health and risk of developing cancer. Cats that are overweight or obese, or those that have a poor diet, may have a higher risk of developing certain types of cancer. Regular exercise can help maintain a healthy weight, while a balanced diet can provide your cat with the necessary nutrients for good health. Ensuring that your cat has a balanced diet and gets regular exercise can go a long way in maintaining a healthy weight and reducing the risk of cancer.

## **Diagnosing Cancer in Cats**

### Veterinary Examination

When concerns about your cat's health arise, particularly the possibility of cancer, the veterinary examination becomes a pivotal moment. Your veterinarian's expertise lies within their ability to thoroughly gather and analyze your cat's medical history, which often holds clues about their overall health trajectory. Providing your vet with a detailed account of any symptoms or behavioral changes leading up to the appointment is essential. Understanding your cat's past ailments and current condition informs the vet's approach to the physical examination, where they meticulously check for lumps, abnormalities, or any other physical indicators of cancer. To confirm a diagnosis and explore treatment options, the vet may recommend consulting a veterinary oncologist, a specialist in animal cancer care. With each visit, your veterinarian is not just checking the health of your cat, but safeguarding the cherished bond you share with your companion.

### Blood Tests and Urinalysis

Blood tests and urinalysis are critical components in the early detection of cancer in cats. These routine health screenings can reveal subtle changes that might not yet be causing any visible symptoms but may indicate the presence of cancer. For example, a complete blood count (CBC) can show abnormalities in the number of white or red blood cells, which can be a sign of certain types of cancer. The biochemical profile, another common blood test, can measure various chemicals in the blood, including enzymes and electrolytes, which might be altered due to cancer.

A urinalysis is equally important in checking for signs of disease. This test assesses the urine for its physical and chemical properties, as well as microscopic examination of cells, which can uncover issues such as [urinary tract infections](https://www.codapet.com/senior-pet-care/understanding-feline-lower-urinary-tract-disease-flutd) or kidney problems that could be related to cancer.

Emphasizing the value of these screenings, regular check-ups that include blood tests and urinalysis are essential for maintaining your cat’s health. Early detection through these methods can lead to more effective treatment options, increasing the likelihood of a positive outcome for your beloved pet.

### Imaging Techniques

Various imaging techniques, such as X-rays, ultrasound, endoscopy, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), can be used to help diagnose cancer in cats. These imaging tests provide detailed images of your cat's internal organs and structures, allowing your vet to see any tumors or abnormalities. However, while imaging can reveal the presence of a tumor, it does not determine the type of cancer. For this, further testing, such as a biopsy, may be required. Imaging plays a crucial role in not only diagnosing cancer but also in planning the appropriate treatment.

### Biopsy and Histopathology

When facing the possibility of cancer in a cat, veterinarians often turn to biopsy and histopathology. These diagnostic tools are essential in not only confirming the presence of cancer but also in providing critical information about the type and potential behavior of the tumor.

A biopsy is a procedure where a small sample of the tumor is surgically removed. This sample is then examined under a microscope by a veterinary pathologist. The detailed study of the cells, known as histopathology, can reveal the cellular characteristics of the cancer, which is essential in identifying the specific type of cancer your cat may have.

The information garnered from these tests is invaluable when it comes to tailoring a precise treatment plan. However, it's imperative to note that not all cats are suitable candidates for a biopsy. Cats that are frail or have underlying health conditions that make anesthesia risky may not be able to undergo this procedure. In such cases, veterinarians have to rely on alternative methods or sometimes make educated guesses based on other diagnostic tests and the clinical presentation of the disease.

Despite these limitations, biopsy and histopathology remain integral in the fight against feline cancer, guiding veterinarians towards the most effective treatment options for our beloved companions.

## **Treatment Options for Cats with Cancer**

### Surgery

Surgical intervention remains a cornerstone in the fight against cancer in felines. It's most effective for tumors that are superficial or localized, offering the potential not just for alleviation of discomfort but also, in certain cases, a complete cure. Yet, it's vital to acknowledge that surgery isn't always a standalone solution. To enhance the prognosis and tackle any remaining cancerous cells, it is frequently used synergistically with chemotherapy or radiation. The success of surgical treatment relies on various factors, including the cancer's type and stage, as well as the cat's overall health condition. As you navigate these complex choices, we're here to provide the support and information you need to make the most informed and compassionate decisions for your beloved cat.

### Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy is another common treatment option for cancer in cats. It involves the use of drugs, either given by injection or orally, to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy is often used for cancers that have already spread to other parts of the body. While it can be effective in slowing the growth of cancer and reducing symptoms, chemotherapy can also have side effects, including nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. However, many of these side effects can be managed with supportive care and medications.

### Radiation Therapy

Radiation therapy is another treatment option for cancer in cats. It involves the use of targeted beams of radiation to kill cancer cells. This type of therapy is often utilized when surgery isn't viable—either because the tumor is inoperable or too intricate to be removed safely. In cases where cancer has metastasized, radiation therapy may be the recommended course of action to slow disease progression and alleviate symptoms.

While an effective tool in combating cancer, radiation therapy does come with potential side effects. These can range from localized skin irritation around the treatment site to generalized fatigue that affects a cat's overall well-being. While these side effects can cause discomfort, they are generally temporary and can often be managed through supportive care strategies**.**

Radiation therapy is typically limited to specialty veterinary clinics that have the equipment and expertise to offer this service. Your primary veterinarian can recommend and refer you and your pet to a special clinic for radiation therapy if this option seems appropriate for your situation and your pet’s condition.

### Immunotherapy

Immunotherapy represents a cutting-edge approach in the treatment of feline cancer, harnessing the cat's own immune system to target and combat malignancies. As a relatively new option in the realm of veterinary oncology, it signifies a significant leap forward in potential cancer care for our feline companions.

This technique empowers a cat's natural defenses by either stimulating the immune response to recognize and fight cancer cells more effectively or by administering substances that bolster the immune system. The promise of immunotherapy lies in its specificity — aiming to minimize the impact on healthy cells while focusing on cancerous ones.

Despite its potential benefits, the application of immunotherapy in cats faces challenges. Current availability is limited, it may not be universally suitable across all types of feline cancer, and the costs associated can be substantial. Moreover, as with any medical treatment, immunotherapy carries its own set of side effects and considerations.

## **Living with a Cat with Cancer**

### Providing Comfort and Care

Living with a cat with cancer can be challenging, but providing comfort and care for your pet during this time can greatly improve their quality of life. This involves monitoring your cat's condition closely and reporting any changes to your vet. Pain management is also a crucial aspect of care for cats with cancer. Your vet can recommend appropriate pain medications and other supportive care measures to help manage any discomfort your cat may be experiencing. We believe in providing compassionate care for pets with cancer. We are here to support you and your pet during this difficult time, offering guidance on how to best care for your pet and manage their symptoms.

### Dietary Considerations

Dietary considerations are a crucial part of caring for a cat with cancer. A balanced diet can help support your cat's health during their cancer treatment. Certain foods may even help boost their immune system and improve their ability to cope with the side effects of treatment. It's important to consult with your vet or a pet nutritionist to create a suitable diet plan for your cat, taking into account their specific needs and dietary restrictions.

### Maintaining Quality of Life

Maintaining a good quality of life is fundamental when caring for a cat diagnosed with cancer. It involves not only the appropriate medical interventions and palliative care but also a focus on the cat's daily living experience. Regular veterinary check-ups and health screenings are vital for adapting treatment plans effectively according to your cat's evolving needs. Supportive care is also essential; pain management strategies, proper nutrition, and hydration play a role in mitigating discomfort and promoting overall well-being.

However, medical treatments are just one aspect of care. The value of companionship cannot be overstated – ensuring your feline friend has a loving presence by their side can profoundly influence their comfort and morale. Additionally, creating a comfortable living environment, free from stress and with easy access to their favorite resting places, can make a significant difference in their quality of life.

Understanding and addressing the holistic needs of your cat, including their emotional and environmental wellbeing, is pivotal. It ensures a nurturing journey through their cancer treatment, imbued with kindness and empathy at each step.

### When to Consider Euthanasia

Euthanasia can be a compassionate option for cats with advanced cancer, particularly if their quality of life has significantly declined and they are suffering. This is never an easy decision to make, and it's important to discuss this option thoroughly with your vet, taking into consideration your cat's overall health, comfort, and dignity. At CodaPet, we understand the profound bond between pets and their families, and we're here to ensure that when it's time to say goodbye, your cherished companion can do so with dignity and peace, right at home. Our team of end-of-life veterinarians provides compassionate, in-home euthanasia services, providing guidance and support every step of the way.

## **Prevention and Early Detection of Cancer in Cats**

### Regular Veterinary Check-ups

Regular veterinary check-ups are fundamental in the early detection and prevention of cancer in cats. These visits give veterinarians the opportunity to conduct thorough health screenings, during which they can detect any abnormalities or early indicators of cancer that may otherwise go unnoticed. Catching cancer early dramatically increases the likelihood of successful treatment and can notably improve the quality of life for your cherished feline friend. By engaging in preventive health measures, including scheduling consistent veterinary appointments, you can significantly lower the risk of cancer and safeguard the health of your cat. Embracing prevention and early detection strategies is a vital step in promoting the well-being and longevity of your dear companions.

### Importance of Vaccinations

Vaccinations are essential in the prevention of certain types of cancer in felines, particularly due to the connection between cancer and the [feline leukemia virus (FeLV)](https://www.codapet.com/senior-pet-care/all-you-need-to-know-about-feline-leukemia). Scientific evidence has shown that cats infected with FeLV are at a significantly increased risk of developing cancers such as lymphoma. Preventive vaccinations against FeLV can be instrumental in reducing a cat's risk of contracting this virus and subsequently developing associated cancers.

Moreover, assuring that your cat receives regular vaccinations is an indispensable component of comprehensive preventive health care. These vaccinations safeguard not only against cancer but also against a host of other serious infections that could compromise your cat's quality of life. By staying up-to-date with a vaccination schedule, cat owners can help maintain their pets' health and fortify their defense against illnesses.

### Spaying and Neutering

Spaying and neutering your feline friends are more than just population control measures; they are also key strategies in cancer prevention. Spaying, the surgical removal of the ovaries and uterus in female cats, has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of mammary tumors, many of which may be malignant. By having your female cat spayed before she experiences her first estrus cycle, you potentially lower the odds of mammary cancer development.

Neutering, or the removal of the testicles in male cats, eliminates any chance of testicular cancer and can reduce the risk of prostate problems. Beyond cancer prevention, these procedures contribute to a healthier, more stable life for your cat by mitigating risk behaviors and health complications associated with intact pets.

Before deciding, it is essential to have a thorough consultation with your veterinarian. Your vet can provide detailed insights tailored to your cat's specific age, breed, and health condition, ensuring that the timing and approach to spaying or neutering align with your pet’s overall health plan.

Understanding the full scope of health benefits associated with these procedures can reassure you that you're taking a proactive step in caring for your cat’s long-term wellbeing.

### Healthy Diet and Exercise

A healthy diet and regular exercise are crucial for maintaining a healthy weight in cats, which can in turn help reduce the risk of cancer. Obesity has been linked to an increased risk of certain types of cancer as well as other health issues affecting quality of life. So keeping your cat at a healthy weight is an important preventive measure. A balanced diet can provide your cat with the necessary nutrients for overall health, while regular exercise can help keep your cat active and fit. At CodaPet, we advocate for a balanced lifestyle for your pets, including a nutritious diet and regular physical activity, as a key part of preventive health care.
