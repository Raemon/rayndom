Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

Veterinary medicine is as much about family as it is about animals. Our pets are our mascots, our comedians, our best friends and sometimes our lifelines. It has been a privilege, as a vet, to be a part of so many lives, from newly adopted puppy, kitten, or small mammal, through the mischievous youthful years, middle age, and then the senior years. As pet parents (because I am one too), we sign up for this relationship and all the joy, comedy and surprises. In the senior years, we provide more support, but also get to enjoy a shared history and comfort that is irreplaceable. Giving our pets the dignity and comfort of a low-stress death is a gift, and you could say, a responsibility. Undoubtedly this is also the hardest part of that relationship. Having experienced profound loss in my own lifetime, I’ve learned how to look scary things in the eye and hold steady. I can support you, your family and your animal through this process and it is my honor to do so.

> Dr. Duvall did a fantastic job easing our dog out of this world, and in tending to our human needs and concerns as well. She really went the extra mile and was full of compassion for all of us. I can't imagine how the inherently difficult situation could have been made any easier.

> We were so grateful for Dr. Megan Blasier Duvall helping our cat pass in a humane manner. Our cat was suddenly ill. When she came over, she not only reassured us that there were likely limited (quality of life) treatment options but she also made the process so calming for our sweet cat. We are so relieved that our sweet pet is no longer suffering and so grateful that the doctor made the transition easy for us. These vets are angels 😇

> Sometimes saying goodbye to a pet feels like saying goodbye to a loved one. Dr. Megan Duvall with CodaPet ensured an empathetic and stress-free experience for my senior cat, fiance, and I. She walked through the process, step by step, prior to starting the session. Her energy was very kind, understanding, and comforting. She was with all of us through every step of the process, checking on us repeatedly, and moved at our pace. She even brought treats for our pet which he very much enjoyed prior to departure. The experience was stress-free for him and we were given time to grieve. Thank you so much Dr. Megan Duvall for creating a safe space for all of us. 10/10 recommend!

> We couldn’t have had a better experience with Dr. Duvall. After saying goodbye to my last dog at a vet’s office, I just knew I wanted to do things differently this time around. It’s not that the vet was unkind, it was the atmosphere and the fact that Oscar didn’t know where he was in his last moments. This past weekend, we had to say goodbye again. And Dr. Duvall was very aware of this fact and tried to make things as comfortable for Baozi as much as she could. He passed peacefully on a blanket laid out on my living room floor and just looked as though he were in a deep sleep. She also went over his medical history to give a second opinion on what could possibly have been ailing him. I found Baozi on the side of the road as a puppy. He lived a full 15 yrs and held on as long as he could. I could’ve done with 15 more though. We’ll miss him sorely but thankfully he was so cozy in the end.

> Dr. Duvall brought her care and experience to help me on a very difficult day. As a retired vet tech, I have been involved in many euthanasias. For me and my boy, Dr. Duvall's combination of technique and appropriate amount of caring conversation made this the smoothest transition I have ever been involved in. I highly recommend her when it's time to consider at-home end of life services.

> Dr. Duvall did an excellent job with our sweet dog and our family. She touched base a few days before the visit, and then explained everything well when she arrived. It was our first time using in-home pet euthanasia and I would recommend it. It’s so nice to be at home in a familiar environment for both the pet and those that loved the pet.

> This was such a heartbreaking loss for us and Dr. Duvall was so caring and compassionate. She took the time to explain all that was going to happen and made us feel at ease knowing our baby would not suffer. This is one of the most difficult decisions we have to make and glad she was here to help us through it.

> It’s the hardest decision I’ll ever have to make, and it has to be right, and it has to be perfect. Dr. Duvall was the perfect choice, and my pup’s transition could not have been any better. She was patient, thorough, and most of all, completely compassionate. I could not have thanked her enough.

> I let my pup of nearly 16 years go this morning, and if I could give 500 stars for this service, I would do so happily. Dr. Megan Duvall could not have been more compassionate, more professional, more…perfect. I could go through each stage, every step, and it was so incredibly peaceful on the bed where she slept, in my arms, with not a shred of anxiety or pain. As this will always be the most difficult decision we make for our beloved companion, you want this experience to be as beautiful as it can be, and it was. I cannot recommend Dr. Duvall and Coda enough.

> Dr. Megan Duvall was the best we could have asked for. This was such a hard decision and experience- one I have never been through. From her text the day before to her compassion and gentleness the day of and the follow up note she send us helped make this decision not as difficult. I would recommend her to all my friends and family. Thank you Megan, we truly appreciate everything you did to help us with Oliver.
