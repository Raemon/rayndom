## What pet parents are saying

> Dr. Kim was so gentle and kind with both my mom and I as well as our dear cat Sonny. She offered helpful explanations throughout the process, helping me to assess his situation that provided me a comfort in the decision. Throughout the process she was attentive so that Sonny was comfortable and left this life peacefully with his people by his side. I highly recommend her for professionalism and her gentle demeanor with us. She followed up with thoughtful words several days later that meant a great deal. Dr. Kim loves animals and uses her expertise to assist at a difficult time for all. She was a blessing to us and agreed to come on very short notice so our baby did not suffer.

> Our family is so grateful to Dr Kim for coming to our home to help us say goodbye to our beloved Aldo. We could not bear the thought of taking him to a clinic for our final moments together. Dr Kim was wonderful throughout the time she spent with us and afterwards. I highly recommend Dr Kim to pet parents who want an unhurried, compassionate setting during one of life's most difficult decisions.

> Dr Bagnoni was very professional and very caring about us and Charlie. After going through having this done at home, I would not do it any other way unless it was an emergency. Definitely recommend her. Thank you so much for Charlie’s paw print and for making sure we were okay.

> I can’t thank Dr. Kim Bagnoni enough for the incredible care she showed during Toby’s at-home euthanasia! She truly made a terrible situation, along with all the strong emotions involved, just a little more bearable, which honestly is everything you could hope for during such a hard time. Throughout the entire time she was in my home, she was so patient, gentle, and compassionate, and never made me feel rushed. She went the extra mile by checking in on me several times afterward and even gave me Toby’s paw prints in ink, a sweet little ornament of his paw prints to remember him by, and a handwritten card. I highly recommend her to anyone who needs someone caring and compassionate for their pets!

> Dr Kim was so accommodating! Our Baby was so sick and really needed the help of Dr. Kim. It was a holiday and she came right away.🙏🏻. She was so kind and patient with us. I have told many people that when the time comes for your pet, this is the only way to go. She also reassured me that I was making the best decision for my Baby, which is what I needed to hear.

> Dr. Kim was an absolute angel! She made the passing of our sweet Belle (15 year old blue tick) so much easier. Her compassion and just overall presence during such a hard time was so comforting. I will be recommending the at home service to anyone I know who has an elderly dog.

> Dr Kim showed delicate compassion for our cat, Rosa ,as well as for us. She showed sympathy, concern, tenderness, and professionalism. My partner and I felt like Rosa was leaving us in great comfort and peace. We are still so sad, but knowing she is no longer suffering brings our hearts warmth. They get no better than Dr. Kim Bagnoni. She was truly a blessing sent from God! Melinda and Rose

> This was our first time having to put one of our pets down. Dr. Kim was so kind and gentle with us and our cat. She walked us through everything beforehand and answered our questions so that we were prepared. I highly recommend Dr. Kim. I felt that she gave proper respect to our boy and we are so very thankful for her. This was definitely not easy to go through but she really helped us through it.
