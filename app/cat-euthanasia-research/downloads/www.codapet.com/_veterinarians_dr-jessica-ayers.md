Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

After about 5 years in small animal and equine general practice, I felt like I needed to try something else and I was really interested in the science and discovery behind all of the amazing advances in both human and animal medicine, so I switched over to the laboratory animal medicine field which I've been privileged to be a part of since 2009. Although I am still working full-time at CSU, I see in family and friends and my own experiences that end-of-life pet care is so hard to deal with. Just the process of needing to take our pets into a clinic can be so stressful on both us and the pets and I think that being able to offer end of life care for pets in their own homes where they are most comfortable and where owners have privacy to grieve is a truly valuable service that I can provide to our community.
