Verified Veterinarian

Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I became a veterinarian because of my deep interest in reproduction and the miracle of bringing new life into the world. That passion remains an important part of who I am as a veterinarian. Over the course of my career, however, I have come to truly appreciate the full journey of a pet’s life and the profound bond between animals and their families. Supporting that human–animal bond has become central to my work. I want to provide in-home euthanasia so I can help pets pass peacefully, surrounded by the people who love them most, and offer families comfort and dignity during one of the most difficult moments they will face.
