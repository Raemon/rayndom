Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

My beloved dog, who saw me through veterinary school, the move to Germany, and through the birth of our first 2 daughters, was dying of cancer. She hated going to the veterinarian. A veterinarian friend came to help her pass at home. Experiencing this tremendous loss, where Roly and my husband and I were most comfortable, made that incredibly hard day the littlest bit easier. I knew that this gift was something I'd someday provide to other pets. That was in 2005 and upon retiring from the Army, I began to offer this service to help other pets and their people.

> Dr Dawn Fitzhugh was an incredible comfort to all of us during Phineas’s final hour. She has a deeper understanding of the physical and emotional aspects of the death process than any general practice vet I’ve ever worked with, and explained every step patiently and compassionately. I’m forever grateful to her for easing my sweet boy’s suffering.
