Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

One reason I became a veterinarian was to serve the bond between people and their pets. Saying goodbye to a longtime friend is one of the most difficult passages we face. Being able to say goodbye peacefully at home, in a familiar environment, can eliminate some of the stresses of the process for both people and pets.

## What pet parents are saying

> When our “little-girl” of 13 years suffered a sudden stroke, my wife, daughter, and I knew that if we didn’t act quickly she was going to suffer. We found that Dan was available to help us, so we booked an in-home appointment immediately. When Dan arrived he was so polite, reverent, and respectful of us and our situation. Her awareness and strength were beginning to slip before he arrived, but he gently checked her to make sure that our suspicions were correct. Thankfully we were able to spend those last precious moments together holding her , crying our eyes out together, telling her how much we loved her, and how thankful we were for her love of us, how she rescued us, and that she will always be with us. We truly could not now look back on that experience as a positive one, had Dan Taylor not been there for us. From all of us, and “our little-girl” we thank you from the bottom of our hearts. We miss her beyond words, but we due so knowing that she died peacefully, at home with us, cuddled-up in her “blanky”with all her stuffed-animal friends, and that beautiful smile on her face.

> He was extremely kind and supportive through the process of putting our sweet dog down. He walked us through everything, made us feel very comfortable, and gave us all of the time we needed. It was a heartbreaking moment but he made it the best it could be. We can’t thank him enough for the kindness he showed us during this time.

> Dr. Dan Taylor was wonderful with our in home pet euthanasia experience. He was warm, spoke softly around our cat and us, gave us all the time we needed through each step of the process, and spoke words of comfort and encouragement at a time we really needed to hear it. It is always a difficult decision for pet owners, but I will definitely look him up when the time comes that we need to make this decision again. Thank you Dan for being so wonderful.

> Dan Taylor, the vet we found through CodaPet, could not have been better to guide us through the loss of our deeply-loved dog, Amelia. He was so kind, thoughtful, and knowledgeable that it made the process as natural as it could possibly be. My partner’s son shared that he felt like Dr. Taylor was so spiritual it felt like he was a “priest”. Thank you, Dr. Taylor, for providing us with the guidance and space to say goodbye to Amelia. The memory will be one we cherish and revisit along with all the joyful ones we have of our best friend.

> Dr. Dan Taylor was so incredibly kind, thoughtful, informative and professional when he came to the house when it was time to say goodbye to my beloved cat Chloe. Having this ability to say goodbye in an environment that everyone was comfortable in without the trauma of having to be uprooted to go to an office where the lights are too bright and nothing seems peaceful was invaluable.

> Dr. Dan Taylor was an absolute pleasure to work with. He made the entire experience much easier for my family during a very difficult time. He was in constant contact throughout the week as I hemmed and hawed my decision. When it came time for our appointment, he spent a good amount of time explaining everything to my family and allowed time for questions. He assured us that we had made the right decision, which I know helped me in that moment. While this was an overall overwhelmingly difficult situation, he made it as seamless and stress free as possible. If I ever had to put another pet down, he would be my first call. Thank you Dr. Taylor, the Howell family appreciates you and your kindness!

> One of the most heartbreaking experiences is losing a beloved furry friend. I recently had to face the loss of my 19 year old cat, Pickle. The option to have him pass in the comfort his own home in the presence of his family who loved him so was such a precious gift to all of us. Dr. Dan Taylor was instrumental in helping us through the process and giving Pickle the gentle, peaceful passing he so deserved. Dr. Taylor’s compassion, kindness, patience, and knowledge made the moment bearable for us. After I made the initial appointment on-line, Dr. Taylor immediately reached out to me to offer support and to answer any questions I might have. Shortly afterwards we talked by phone and he remained available to me as I needed throughout the next few days, offering support and guidance. He even rescheduled so that my daughter could be present as well. His presence comforted and seemed to reassure my precious cat. I am so grateful for Dr. Taylor’s gentle assistance during one of the most heartbreaking experiences of my life. I will be forever thankful for him and will contact him again if faced with this situation again. Thank you Dr. Taylor from the bottom of our hearts.
