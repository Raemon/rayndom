Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

Becoming a vet has allowed me to share my love of animals with others while improving the lives of animals through special care and education of their owners. Providing in-home euthanasia enables me to make the most difficult part of loving a furry companion as comfortable a transition as possible for both the pet and his/her person or family.

## Education

> Dr. Juli Peters was absolutely wonderful. She was so compassionate and respectful of my wishes but at the same time had everything under control. It gave me assurance that it was all ok. I am very grateful. She also personally delivered his ashes and followed up with a beautiful card after. She truly cares and I am very appreciative.

> The experience was more than I could imagine. Dr Peters was very professional and compassionate to my needs and my pet Dixie who was suffering from cancer and was no longer able to get around. Dr Peters rescheduled our appointment and came the night before scheduled to provide the service needed without delaying to give my baby some peace and to avoid any prolonged suffering. She made this experience very pleasant for us both and I know I made the best decision for Dixie. She left here at peace and never knew anything was going on except she was with me giving her hugs and love as she drifted off to sleep. I am very satisfied with her service she provided. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I could have did it without your kindness and true compassion you showed us. Your a great Vet and I recommend her 💯.

> Dr Juli Peters came out to our home to help our sweet Chloe, who was at the end of her battle with cancer. Dr Peters was so kind and compassionate, making the transition easier on us. She explained everything she was doing & gave us time to say our final goodbyes. I can’t say enough good things about her & CodaPet! Thank you all so very much!!!
