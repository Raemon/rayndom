Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I entered veterinary medicine due to a passion in wildlife conservation. I eventually transitioned to small animal care (cats and dogs), and fell in love. I have found that I take great pride in and excel at helping owners transition their pets to the afterlife in as smooth a process as possible.

## What pet parents are saying

> We were so lucky to be able to utilize codaPet - at home euthanasia services with Dr. Haros. The process was very easy to understand, very compassionate, and really a blessing. This was not our first using an at home service but it was our first experience with codaPet. We would absolutely use this in home euthanasia service if the need arises again. It’s truly worth it to send off your best friend from the comfort of their own home without the added anxiety of travel when they don’t feel well and more peaceful and quiet for them at home. Thank you for helping us through this truly difficult time.

> Dr Haros came to my home to help my Laila pass. He was on time very respectful and very caring to Laila, my son and myself. He took his time with Laila and was very gentle. Based on my experience I highly recommend Dr Haros. When I am ready for another pet I want Dr Haros for our full time vet.

> Dr. Haros was kind, compassionate and professional from beginning to end. Great communication and gave us plenty of time to say our goodbyes for our beloved Boston, Franklin. It was a difficult decision, but am so thankful to have had a compassionate first time home service. We even received a card in the mail a few weeks after. Thank you for going above and beyond for our dog.

> From the moment Dr. Haros walked thru our door. We immediately felt his compassion. The way he spoke with kindness and authenticity were comforting. He explained each step in the beginning and continue to tell us what was going to happen as during the whole procedure. He stopped and gave us the time we needed during each step. Asked us if we ready for each step. We were able to send our Ace with him with his blanket and teddy. He took such care removing Ace from our home. We want to THANK him for the compassion and care for my family and our little buddy Ace.

> Dr Haros made my dogs passing comfortable and gave us closure. He had incredible bedside manner, accommodated our wishes to doing things outside in our backyard where our dog most loved to be and explained every step of the way and answered all of our questions seamlessly. For having to make one of the worst types of appointment it was the best experience we could’ve hoped for. Thank you Dr Haros

> Dr. Haros has helped us with 2 of our senior pets. He is caring and always empathetic to us and the other pets in the home who need comfort. He always takes as much time as we need to say our goodbyes to our loved ones. I'd highly recommend his service and will continue to call on him as the need arises.
