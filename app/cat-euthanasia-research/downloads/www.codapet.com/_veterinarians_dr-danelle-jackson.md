Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I became a vet because of how important veterinary care was to the success of my family's farm. I loved being able to watch our farm vets work on our cows. I've spent over 10 years working in small animal veterinary clinics and have seen how stressful the process of euthanizing an animal in a clinic can be. There are other clients, loud noises, and emergencies. In-home euthanasia provides a calmer environment that the pets and families are familiar with to reduce the stress for everyone involved. I always worried about clients having to drive home from a clinic while distraught, and in home euthanasia eliminates that worry.

> After 13 amazing years with our dog, the time came when we had to make the gut wrenching decision to end his pain and suffering. We chose the at home pet euthanasia offered by CodaPet. Dr. Danelle Jackson DVM was GREAT. She explained every step of the process and what to expect. She was extremely thoughtful and very kind and understanding. She gave me both time and space for the most painful goodbye to Lace. I would highly recommend her services. It was very comforting to do this at home in the same loving environment Lace has known his entire life. Thank you so much

> Dr. Jackson was so kind…she was very patient with all of us…our entire family was with Daisy, our chihuahua, to say goodbye! That included our Rottweiler who quickly figured out she had treats…we wanted him to be able to say goodbye too…Dr. Jackson made absolutely sure that Daisy was sound asleep before her final injection to make sure that she didn’t feel anything…I would definitely recommend Dr. Jackson and Coda and I will never say goodbye in a cold and bright Drs office again! Thank you for your kindness…

> Couldn’t have asked for better support during one of the most difficult times. Dr Jackson was so kind and supportive. Being able to have our pet pass in our home was the best experience. It was helpful for our other dog to have an understanding of what happened to her sister. It was a peaceful situation for us. Dr Jackson was so knowledgeable and patient. She was very professional and took the most gentle care with our passing pet. The whole process, we felt like she was very aware of our tender feelings but also the comfort of our pet. She made sure our pup was well taken care of before and after her passing, and that made all the difference. We would 10000% recommend Dr Jackson’s in home services.

> Dr. Danelle Jackson was so very genuine and compassionate. It made the process much easier she texted ahead of our appointment to answer questions, outline process, etc. it was so helpful to do the process for our 14 year old dog Jinger in our house where she is comfortable. She gave her some treats which made her at ease. I highly recommend the Dr. and this service. It’s never an easy process but I can’t say enough good things about the Dr. her experience and overall process.

> During a most difficult time for us, Dr. Jackson came like an angel and helped our precious Zona cross that rainbow bridge. It was always a traumatic experience for her to go to the vet, but her tail wagged when Dr. Danelle Jackson came to our house, she was relaxed and comfortable as possible. Thank you so much for your help through this very difficult time, you have made one good memory in our last moments with our little girl. God bless! Al n Donna Lippincott

> CODA Pet quickly put us in touch with a local veterinarian. Dr Jackson was incredibly kind and quickly responded to our crisis. Our fur baby had been seriously injured by another dog and the only option was to put them down. It was less than an hour from the incident to her making sure our baby was no longer in pain. While I wish we had never had to go through this Dr Jackson made it easier with her professionalism and overwhelming kindness and understanding. She is an amazing human and I am grateful for her being put in our path. We had no idea this was a service that was available in our community until we needed it. Glad we got the help we needed.

> Though it was a devastating choice to make, I'm glad Nala was able to go in such peace knowing we were all at home with her. I can't imagine her last memory being in a vets office in my personal opinion most pets dislike vet clinics. The best thing was she was so comfortable being loved and pampered by all of us. Danelle was amazing and so caring. She made sure Nala was comfortable and gave us the time to say our goodbyes without a rush. I would strongly recommend at home passing with CodaPet ❤️

> We recently had to end the life of our beloved German Shepherd that was with us for almost 13 years. As sad and heartbreaking as the days surrounding this were for us, Dr. Jackson eased so much of the sadness, anxiety, and uncertainty we had. She was very professional, patient, and understanding. She gave us all the time we needed with our baby boy to say our prayers and goodbyes. She answered all of our questions and put our minds at ease regarding the procedure and what would happen to our boy when he left home (we had him cremated and remains returned to us). We fully recommend Dr. Jackson when this sad and difficult time comes for pet parents looking to send their furry angels off with love, kindness, and dignity. Thank you Dr. Jackson and Foothills Animal Hospital for the referral. 🙏🏻

> It has been one of the most devastating times in our lives with the loss of our baby girl Zona Bear, making the decision to end her pain and suffering was hard. We have to say, Dr. Danelle Jackson came like an Angel, we told Zona you have a visitor, she was excited wagging her tail and was at complete peace. The care and loving kindness as the process moved forward at our home by Dr. Jackson truly helped us and our baby girl cross that rainbow bridge. Thank you CodaPet for having great doctors.

> It’s always a pet owners most difficult decision to have to help them cross over. We were just passing thru the area when we had to make ours. We are very thankful for Dr Jackson in helping Huckleberry be at peace and free from pain in his last moments. I’ve had a very traumatic experience in the past with taking a pet in to a vets office and him dying in the back room and the office not allowing me to be with him while he was waiting to be seen and I never wanted that to happen again. Huckleberry was able to be surrounded by family and the love he so deserved on his last day earth-side. Dr Jackson was very kind to give us a private moment with him before the final moment, and took care of the cremation and made sure his ashes was returned within a few days before we had to leave town. Thank you Dr Jackson for your help, you helped make a sad day a more meaningful one.

> Making the decision to help our Bowie cross over the rainbow bridge was very difficult, one of the hardest we have had to make as a pet owner. Dr. Jackson was kind, understanding and explained the process thoroughly allowing us time to ask questions and to be with our pet during it all. I also would like to add that Dr. Jackson was able to accommodate a date change last minute. She took our pet to the crematory and within a week we picked him up. This was our first experience and would greatly recommend Dr. Jackson.

I’ll never forget this bittersweet moment she provided for us. Thank you! ~Jeni & James
