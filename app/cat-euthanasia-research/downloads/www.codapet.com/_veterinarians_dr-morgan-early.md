Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

Animals have always been a central part of my life, and from the very beginning, I knew that becoming a veterinarian was my calling. I met my husband in veterinary school, and together, our lives now revolve around our five beloved girls—three dogs and two cats! After six years of clinical experience, I felt a deep desire to offer in-home euthanasia services. Saying goodbye to a cherished pet is one of the most heart-wrenching decisions a person can face, and it's often one of the most difficult days of their life. In these moments, my goal is to ease the burden for the family while ensuring that the patient’s passing is as peaceful and dignified as possible in the comfort of their own home. For all the love, loyalty, joy, and comfort our animals provide us throughout their lives, offering them a peaceful, compassionate departure is the greatest gift and responsibility I can give as a veterinarian.

> Dr. Morgan is the most nurturing and empathetic doctor you will ever find. She has such a light and a calming presence, she has helped me with many pets and came out to our family’s farm to lay our sweet little Jazzy to rest. It was such a peaceful experience and I wouldn’t have imagined it any other way. She made it so easy and brought such peace to our hearts as we said goodbye to our old girl. Please consider booking with her for your furry loved ones as they need help going over the rainbow bridge, the in home-euthanasia is priceless. You and your family will be so thankful you were able to give your pet such a peaceful goodbye in the comfort of their favorite place, home.

> Dr. Morgan Early came to our home to provide this service to us for our beloved Homer. She was kind, thoughtful and prepared. It’s never easy to say goodbye to a furry loved one, especially one we got to love on for 13 years. She helped our little guy pass over the rainbow bridge peacefully at home surrounded by love and TREATS. Lots of treats ;) While I hope to not need her services again soon, I would recommend her and CodaPet to anyone looking to allow your pet to pass peacefully at home. Thanks again Morgan, you were amazing!

> Thank you Dr. Early for coming to my home and did what you did to help my sweet Emmett at ease.🥹 It is the hardest decision 💔 but you made it happen. The impression that you gave me when I first saw you was that you have a very gentle kind face and talking to you..your personality is very sweet and kind hearted. That really made me more comfortable going through this with my Emmett. Thank you again Dr. Early. 🥹❤️

> Dr. Morgan Early is great! It is so hard to say good bye to your fur baby, but if you are thinking about at home euthanasia I highly recommend her. She was so good with our dog and made the process so much easier.

> Dr. Early made an extremely difficult day bearable. She took care of our girl like she was her own. Dr. Early gave us a thorough but gentle explanation of the process. She provided us with as much time as we needed and did not rush at all during our time with her. We are so appreciative of how she cared for us and for our girl that day and in the days since. She truly has a heart of gold.

> We have said goodbye to 3 dogs prior to Lucy’s passing at home. This time with Dr. Early was by far (for lack of a better word) the best experience it could be for a very difficult time. It was respectful, peaceful, loving and far less stressful. We know Lucy is playing in the sun (and the hose) with Sadie, Poncho and Linus. Many thanks for Dr. Early for making a bad day better! Ken, Chris, Charlie, Sally and Sidney.
