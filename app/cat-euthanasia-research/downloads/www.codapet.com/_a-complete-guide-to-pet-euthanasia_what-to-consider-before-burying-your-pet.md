# What To Consider Before Burying Your Pet

[Dr. Bethany Hsia](/experts/dr-bethany-hsia)

July 09, 2023

When facing the end of a beloved pet’s life, there is a lot of information and emotions to sort through. Here we discuss what to know, should you decide that burial is right for your pet.

## What to Consider:

  * No federal law outlaws dog burial on private property or in backyards.
  * However, some states, counties, and cities may have laws that regulate or ban this practice.
  * Before burying your dog, make sure to speak with a person with knowledge of the statutes in your specific area.



Losing a pet is never easy; many pet owners want to leave their beloved companions to rest at home. While there are no nationwide laws on pet burial, regulations vary by state, county, and city. Some states, like Arkansas, Vermont, and Wisconsin, prohibit backyard pet burial, while California only allows it in rural areas. Arizona has no state bans, but many cities have their own restrictions, so it’s always best to check [local regulations](https://www.codapet.com/a-complete-guide-to-pet-euthanasia/where-to-bury-a-pet-understanding-private-vs-cemetery-burial) before making a decision.

Read on to learn more about the laws in your location and the right and wrong ways to go about burying your pet on private property.

## Can You Bury a Dog In Your Backyard?

In general, you are allowed to bury your dog in your backyard in the US. This is because there are no national laws prohibiting this practice. However, it may be outlawed by other localities such as states, counties, and cities. For example:

  * State: Arkansas prohibits pet burial on private property.
  * County: Miami-Dade County, Florida, bans the burial of pets in residential areas.
  * City: Los Angeles, California, does not allow backyard pet burials within city limits.



## Why Is It Illegal To Bury Your Pet In Your Backyard?

Many localities prohibit backyard pet burial due to public health and environmental concerns. Decomposing remains can contaminate groundwater, especially in areas with high water tables or loose soil. Some local governments also worry about the spread of diseases, as certain pathogens can persist in buried remains and pose risks to other animals or even humans. Scavengers, such as coyotes or raccoons, may dig up remains, creating both a safety and sanitation issue.

Additionally, improper burials—such as those that are too shallow or near utility lines—can lead to legal and infrastructural complications. In densely populated areas, backyard burials may be seen as a nuisance or a potential violation of zoning laws. Some municipalities also have regulations in place to ensure proper disposal through cremation or designated pet cemeteries. Finally, Homeowners Association (HOA) rules or deed restrictions may further limit backyard burials, even in areas where they are otherwise legal.

### Backyard Pet Burial By Locality

While many places allow backyard pet burial, it’s important to consider that there may be specific regulations around it.

For example, Washington allows pet burial on private property but has specific rules to ensure environmental safety and public health. The state requires that pet remains be buried under at least three feet of soil to prevent scavenging by wildlife. Additionally, burials must be located at least 100 feet away from water sources, such as wells, streams, or lakes, to prevent contamination.

Further, Missouri allows pet burial on private property but has strict regulations to ensure safety and environmental protection. To prevent contamination, the state requires that pet remains be buried at least 50 feet from property lines and 300 feet from neighboring properties and water sources. Additionally, the burial site must be covered with at least 6 inches of soil to prevent wildlife scavenging.

### Can You Bury a Dog In Your Backyard in Texas?

In Texas, pet burial on private property is generally allowed, but it must be done in a manner that prevents health hazards and environmental contamination. State regulations require that the burial site be at least two feet deep to prevent animal scavenging. Additionally, the burial must not be near water sources like wells, streams, or lakes to avoid contamination.

### Can You Bury Your Dog In Your Backyard in California?

Statewide, no universal laws prohibit it, but many local governments impose restrictions. However, California may also have more laws that ban or regulate this practice on the city or county level than other states. In areas where it is permitted, burials must typically be at least three feet deep and located away from water sources to prevent contamination. Additionally, some counties require that pet remains be wrapped or placed in a biodegradable container before burial.

### Can You Bury Your Dog In Your Backyard in NJ?

In New Jersey, pet burial on private property is generally allowed, but specific regulations are required to ensure environmental and public health safety. The state requires that animal remains be buried at least two feet deep to prevent wildlife scavenging. Additionally, burials must be on the owner's property and located away from water sources, wells, and public areas to avoid contamination and potential health hazards.

### City Laws Around Private Property Pet Burial

Though the practice may be allowed among states and counties, taxpayers and city halls may put in place regulations and prohibitions. Here are a few examples of specific cities with regulations in place:

  * Columbus, Ohio: The city prohibits backyard pet burials, requiring deceased pets to be cremated or disposed of through an approved facility.
  * Austin, Texas: Pet burial is regulated under health and environmental codes, requiring animals to be buried at least two feet underground and a certain distance from water sources.
  * Boston, Massachusetts: Backyard pet burials are not explicitly banned, but strict environmental regulations make it difficult to legally bury pets on private property without violating waste disposal laws.
  * Los Angeles, California: The city prohibits backyard pet burials entirely, requiring that animals be buried only in established cemeteries.
  * Seattle, Washington: In Seattle, pet burial on private property is prohibited, mainly due to health and safety concerns, including the potential for contamination of groundwater. Those wishing to bury their pets must use a pet cemetery or cremation services.



## How To Bury a Dog The Right Way

Before you choose a final resting place for your pet, it’s important to consider your options, along with best practices for burial. Let’s simplify the burial process, considering who, what, when, where, and how. ​‍ ​‍

### Who Can Be Buried ​‍ ​‍ ‌

First, if your pet has died of or was euthanized with a contagious disease, they should be cremated. This will help prevent the accidental exposure of other pets or wildlife. Another consideration is size. To ensure your pet’s resting place stays safe and secure, the burial should allow the top of the pet to be covered with at least two feet of soil. ​‍

### What To Bury Your Pet In ​‍ ​‍ ‌

Many pet parents opt to bury their loved ones in a pet casket. These caskets can be a beautiful way to honor your pet and provide a more secure resting place. For home burials, it’s recommended to choose a biodegradable option, like a wood casket or eco-friendly pod. Some pet caskets allow for personalization with places to add drawings, notes, or inscriptions to honor the departed. ​‍ ​‍ ‌

### When To Bury Your Pet ​‍ ​‍ ‌

Most states require you to bury your pet within 24 to 48 hours after death. If you are using a pet cemetery, they may safely and securely hold your pet until the interment, giving you more time to make arrangements. ​‍

### Where To Bury Your Pet ​‍ ​‍ ‌

As a rule of thumb, burial sites should be well away from any bodies of water, and sandy, rocky, or flood-prone land should be avoided. Improper burial can lead to water pollution and other ecological impacts. As unpleasant as it is to consider, decomposition allows for the release of potentially hazardous compounds and pharmaceuticals, especially in pets that have been euthanized. Be sure to check with local authorities to ensure you comply with all requirements before you start. ​‍ ​‍

Another option for pet burial is a pet cemetery. Many communities have pet cemeteries that offer burial plots, headstones, and memorial services. Arrangements will need to be made in advance so a place is prepared for your pet. ​‍ ​‍

Recently, some human cemeteries have begun to allow pets in certain designated areas. Most cemeteries do not allow pets and their people to be buried together. However, some do allow for cremated pets to be interred with the human family member once they have also passed. ​‍

### How to Bury Your Pet ​‍ ​‍ ‌

It is important to consider the security of the final resting place for any animal. As difficult as it may be to know, your pet’s gravesite may be attractive to wildlife or other animals. Furthermore, the bodies of animals that have been euthanized contain the medication that allowed them to pass peacefully, and these medications can pose a fatal threat to other animals who may ingest them. Should such an animal be a protected species, there may be legal ramifications in addition to the emotional toll. ​‍ ​‍

There are a few steps that can help decrease the chances of desecration by wildlife. First, the depth of the body is important. As previously stated, there should be a minimum of two feet of earth above the body. Additionally, you can place wire or grating over the burial site and under the topsoil. Finally, you may wish to place a headstone or memorial plant, which can also serve to. ​‍ ​‍

## Alternatives To Backyard Pet Burial

If backyard burial is not an option or you prefer a more regulated method of laying your pet to rest, several alternatives are available. These options ensure that your pet is treated with respect and that environmental and health concerns are addressed.

  * [Pet Cemeteries](https://www.codapet.com/a-complete-guide-to-pet-euthanasia/where-to-bury-a-pet-understanding-private-vs-cemetery-burial): Many areas have licensed pet cemeteries where pets can be buried in a designated, safe, and regulated space. These facilities often offer memorial services and headstones for a more ceremonial approach.
  * [Cremation Services](https://www.codapet.com/a-complete-guide-to-pet-euthanasia/how-does-pet-cremation-work): Pet cremation allows owners to keep their pet's ashes in a memorial urn or scatter them in a meaningful location. Some facilities offer individual cremation, ensuring your pet’s ashes are returned to you.
  * Animal Control Services: Some municipalities and animal control agencies provide services for the proper disposal of deceased animals, typically a free or low-cost option.
  * Veterinary Clinics: Many veterinary clinics offer euthanasia services, along with options for pet remains. They may also offer cremation or disposal services.
  * Rendering Plants: Some areas have rendering facilities that accept deceased animals for disposal, turning them into biodegradable material that can be safely processed.
  * Donation to Veterinary Schools: In some cases, veterinary schools or research institutions will accept deceased animals for educational purposes, often for dissection and study.



## Where Can I Bury My Pet For Free?

Some pet disposal options are available at little or no cost. For example, local animal control services often provide free or low-cost disposal of deceased pets, especially in areas where backyard burial is prohibited. Additionally, some veterinary clinics may offer basic disposal services at no charge, particularly if the pet was euthanized at the clinic. Another option to consider is donating the pet's body to science, which can help further research on animal health and education, often at no cost to you.

However, it's important to check with your local municipality, veterinary office, or research institutions to confirm availability and any potential fees. While these free options may not offer the same level of personalization as pet cremation or burial in a pet cemetery, they provide a respectful and cost-effective alternative.

## How In-home Euthanasia Makes Pet Burial Easy

[In-home euthanasia services](https://www.codapet.com/a-complete-guide-to-pet-euthanasia/why-choose-in-home-pet-euthanasia), such as those provided by CodaPet, offer a compassionate and personalized alternative to backyard burial.

After the procedure, the pet's remains are typically handled with care, and owners are often given several respectful disposal options, including cremation or donation to science.

This ensures that pet owners can make arrangements that align with their wishes while avoiding the legal and practical challenges of backyard burial. By using in-home euthanasia services, pet owners can focus on their grief and emotional needs, while professionals manage the logistical aspects of the aftercare process.
