About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I became interested in wanting to give pets a peaceful passing at home. I know that saying goodbye to a beloved pet in the clinic can be stressful for both owners and their pets. End of Life decisions are difficult for everyone.

> Dr. Murray's professionalism, demeanor and compassion was so vital on that day. She was calm, welcomed the curiosity of our other dog and very clearly explained what was going to happen, then, step by step, what was happening. She was the opposite of distracting - she was there with us. Zoe went very peacefully with almost no discomfort and zero fear. I couldn't ask for more than that. I can't thank her enough.

> Our experience with CodaPet has been phenomenal. Dr. Jacque Murray is so kind, compassionate, and professional. She took time to answer our questions and allowed us the opportunity to create a beautiful atmosphere for our beautiful girl's gentle passing. We were given time and space to say our prayers and goodbyes. Our precious girl was removed from our home in the most careful and respectful way. Dr. Murray explained the process and what to expect so well, from the choices of aftercare services to how the procedure itself would be administered and what to expect. It was such a relief and gift for our sweet baby to spend her last moments in her own home. I highly recommend CodaPet and Dr. Murray, as every pet should have this experience.

> Our beloved 17-year-old kitty Lil had been struggling with arthritic pain for some time and when one morning she was unable to stand or walk without pain, we made the difficult decision to help her cross the rainbow bridge. We didn’t want to subject her to any more vet visits, which were highly stressful for her. We found CodaPet through a Google search for in-home euthanasia. Dr Jacque Murray was, fortunately, in our service area. We were able to read her profile and knew that we wanted her to help us. We could not have wished for a more peaceful, beautiful, loving send-off for our Lil. She was in the place that she was most comfortable in the whole world, in our bed with my husband and me at her side. Dr Murray’s calm and caring energy and our soft conversation was comforting, too, to Lil and to us. Dr Murray explained the process to us and answered our questions. She was kind, caring, and so very respectful of Lil and us throughout. We are eternally grateful for her help.

> Dr. Murray came to my home to help my sweet baby make her journey to the Rainbow Bridge. I cannot say enough about Dr. Murray's professionalism and empathy during this highly emotional time. The support and care our sweet girl received was incredible. We were given as much time as needed to say goodbye to her. Dr. Murray is very accommodating and patient. She gave us space to feel comfortable and provided a gentle and calming presence. She answered questions and explained the procedure so we would know what to expect. Dr. Murray was very respectful in allowing us to say prayers, light candles, and say goodbye to our girl. Dr. Murray also explained and presented our aftercare choices in a professional, caring manner. She lovingly cared for our girl as if she were her own as she left our home. It was a pleasure to work with Dr. Murray via CodaPet and their easy-to-use system. Thank you for making the worst day of our lives as bearable and gentle as possible. We came away with a sense of peace and gratitude.
