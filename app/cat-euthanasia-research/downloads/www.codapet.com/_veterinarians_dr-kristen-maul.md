Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

For me, being a veterinarian was my calling in life. I knew from a very young age that I wanted to care for animals. It helped that I love science. I have been practicing for 10 years and recently I began to really reflect on my career and my goals. I love what I do, but what makes me truly happiest is to provide comfort to animals and their families. While the veterinary hospital is a good option for some families, many would prefer the comfort of their own home. I am passionate about the mental health of my patients AND their people. For me, it is an honor to be able to support people and pets to ease suffering as much as possible by providing peaceful, comfortable end of life care for our beloved friends.

> Dr. Kristen was very kind and patient with me as I took my time saying goodbye. I hesitated every step of the way, it was a very hard process to go through. Dr. Kristen gave my wife and I as much privacy as we needed to say goodbye to our cat. He was older and had cancer, recently stopped eating, and was visibly uncomfortable. We knew it was time and Dr. Kristen agreed after examining him, and helped us come to terms with the difficult but loving decision we made for our poor boy.

> Dr. Maul was so sweet and gentle with our boy, Markie. As you can imagine, this was one of our worst days. We loved our boy so much. As awful as it was, it was comforting to be able to do this at home with him and to have someone like Dr. Maul to help guide us through it. If the time comes to make this unbelievably hard decision for your beloved fur baby, I truly believe doing it at home, with Dr. Maul, is the best way. Lastly, not only was she amazing during that time, but she also sent a handwritten card and seeds to plant in memory of our boy. Thank you, Dr. Maul!

> I can’t even begin to explain how amazing CodaPet and Dr. Kristen was during this extremely difficult time. She made the whole process seamless from the time I booked the appointment to when I received my cat’s ashes back. Dr. Kristen has a heart of gold and couldn’t be any more perfect for this challenging line of work. She explained the process from start to finish and was so respectful and empathetic to us and my beloved cat. I can’t recommend her enough. Thank you for everything you do!

> Dr Kristen was completely professional yet also very empathetic to this very difficult situation. She walked through each step of the process and gave us time to process. Dr Kristen not only cared about us and how we were feeling but also our puppy and did everything she could to comfort her.

> I had written a previous review but had rated a 4 because I simply don’t care for 5 reviews but there simply could not have been a better way for my family than this and Dr Maul was kind, took a great deal of time and patience with my whole family and my other pet
