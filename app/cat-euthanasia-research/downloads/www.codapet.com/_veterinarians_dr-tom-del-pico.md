Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I wanted to be a vet because I genuinely liked "who" and "what" veterinarians were as professionals. The joy and challenge of finding solutions to medical problems experienced by critters who cannot speak for themselves seemed like the most noble of professions to me, and it still does. When a family has an ailing or lame pet, the responsibility of finding remedies and easing fears is always the primary job. As a care provider for so many years, and a pet parent myself, the magnitude of the emotional bond that our pets give to us is paramount. The evolution of pain management and palliative care for pets has been nothing short of remarkable. The reality of losing our pets is a huge emotional burden and it is the Veterinarians responsibility to provide a "euthanasia experience" that lessens the stress, anxiety, pain and the fear associated with this important decision. An In-Home experience avoids the many pitfalls and problems of bringing our pets into the hustle and bustle of a clinic. Home is quiet and comforting.
