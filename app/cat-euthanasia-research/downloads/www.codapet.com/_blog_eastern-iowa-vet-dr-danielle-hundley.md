If you’ve been searching for a caring veterinarian who brings kindness and professionalism right to your doorstep, look no further than Dr. Danielle Hundley. Serving Cedar Rapids and surrounding communities, she’s known for providing gentle, at-home pet euthanasia services that honor the special bond between pets and their families.

Let’s get to know the compassionate vet who’s making difficult goodbyes a little easier in Eastern Iowa.

## **Cedar Rapids’ Trusted At-Home Vet**

Dr. Hundley has spent nearly two decades as a veterinarian, dedicating her career to helping pets live well and, when the time comes, pass peacefully. Her approach is simple: pets deserve comfort and dignity, especially in their final moments.

Operating out of Palo, IA, Dr. Hundley travels to Cedar Rapids and nearby towns, including Hiawatha, Marion, and Iowa City, to provide in-home euthanasia services. She understands how difficult it is for families to say goodbye and strives to make the experience as calm and respectful as possible, allowing pets to rest in a familiar environment surrounded by loved ones and their familiar sights and smells.

Her clients often praise her gentle presence and clear communication. One recent review said it best: “Dr. Hundley was incredibly compassionate, gentle, and respectful throughout the entire process. Her calm presence made a heartbreaking day a little more bearable.”

### **A Lifelong Commitment to Animals in Eastern Iowa**

Raised right here in Eastern Iowa, Dr. Hundley’s connection to the region runs deep, shaping both her personal and professional life. From a young age, she developed a profound love for animals, inspired by the close-knit communities and natural beauty of her hometown. After earning her veterinary degree, she made the heartfelt decision to return home, dedicating her skills to the pets and families she knows and cherishes.

Her deep understanding of the local community allows her to provide compassionate, personalized care that reflects the values and needs of Eastern Iowa residents. For Dr. Hundley, serving this region is not just a career—it’s a lifelong commitment to supporting the animals she has always loved.

### **Dr. Hundley’s Favorite Dog-Friendly Destinations in Eastern Iowa**

Eastern Iowa is home to a variety of pet-friendly parks and natural areas where dogs and their families can enjoy quality time outdoors—and Dr. Hundley knows them well. As a local veterinarian offering in-home care, she understands the importance of providing pets with joyful, enriching experiences throughout their lives. Here are a few of her favorite places in the region:

  * **Prairie Park Dog Park, Cedar Rapids** – A spacious, fenced-in area where dogs can run freely and socialize with new friends.
  * **Wickiup Hill Natural Area, Cedar Rapids** – Offers peaceful trails and open space, ideal for long walks and nature outings.
  * **Kent Park, Iowa City** – Known for its scenic walking paths and designated off-leash areas.
  * **Patriots Park, Marion** – A community favorite with ample green space and welcoming walking trails.
  * **Pinicon Ridge Park, Central City** – A sprawling park with a lake, wooded trails, and plenty of room for curious pups to explore.



Dr. Hundley sees these places not just as parks, but as essential spaces that contribute to a pet’s emotional and physical well-being. It’s this deep understanding of a pet’s full life experience that makes her end-of-life care so heartfelt and meaningful.

## **Providing Compassionate End-of-Life Care with CodaPet**
