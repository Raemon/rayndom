## What pet parents are saying

> Dr. Meadows was very kind and compassionate and did his best to put Masaï (my heart dog) at ease and provide us both with comfort. When it was time for him to take Masaï for his journey he gave me a few minutes with him and then was extremely respectful of both Masaï, me and my loss. I'm forever grateful for his kindness and compassion.

> To have my sweet Bubba put to sleep was one of the hardest decisions i have ever made. I called Dr.Meadows and was able to make an appointment for him to come to my home. He was so kind and took the time to get to know my dog , he talked to him while petting him and assessing him at the same time. He was very accommodating , calm and reassuring. Nothing could have made this less painful but his kind and gentle ways made it a little easier. Thank you Dr Meadows and your sweet assistant (I'm sorry I don't remember her name)

> Dr. Meadows was absolutely wonderful. He was kind, compassionate, and attentive to my kitties needs. His comfort and care made the procedure a million times more tolerable. It was quick and painless for my precious baby and I’m forever grateful Dr. Meadows was our doctor. After I scheduled, he called and offered to come right away, even in rush hour traffic. He followed up with a beautiful sympathy card which was so special to us. I highly recommend Dr. Meadows. You won’t find anyone as compassionate and kind.

> Chico was euthanized at our home by Dr. Meadows and his assistant. They let us set the pace and spent time comforting us as they helped our sweet rescue pup (who was a little skittish around people) pass peacefully and quickly. It has been heart-wrenching to lose a dog at only four years of age due to cancer. Dr. Meadows and his assistant guided all of us through this difficult time with compassion and kindness, and even sent a personalized sympathy card afterwards to honor Chico. It’s never an easy decision, but if it’s one you need to make, this is the gentlest way to go, and I would highly recommend Dr Meadows for in-home pet euthanasia.

> Dr. Meadows and his assistant were very kind and compassionate. They entered the house just as quietly as they left. So kind hearted with their condolences as my world shattered. I can't thank them enough for coming to my home when I needed a vet the most. I highly recommend Dr. Meadows should you ever need his in-house service.

> Dr. Meadows is a very compassionate and caring vet. Fortunately, he was able to guide me through the most difficult day. I would recommend him for any services you may need for your fur baby. Two weeks have passed since I lost my beloved Sammie, who was 20 years old. Dr. Meadows reassured me during every step of the difficult process. Please know he is a very kind and comforting person.

> Dr. Meadows was fantastic. He showed so much compassion during a very difficult time. I recently moved to Ocala and was so happy to find Dr. Meadows as I always euthanize my animals at home if deemed necessary. I want them to feel at peace in their own surroundings. My boy Dusty was so peaceful and only felt love and no fear. I will always use Dr. Meadows if deemed necessary for my other furry kids.

> Dr Meadows and his partner were incredibly kind, sensitive, and compassionate towards us and our dog Cali. As difficult and heartbreaking as it was to say goodbye, they made the process as bearable as possible. They were very patient and gentle, giving us all the time we needed in our last moments with her without feeling rushed. It gives us peace of mind knowing she was able to be comfortable at home with us in her final moments. You can tell this team truly cares about animals, and we will be forever grateful for the care they showed to us and Cali.

> Making the decision to euthanize our dog at home was very difficult, but we’re incredibly grateful for the experience. Scheduling was easy (online), and Dr. Meadows was compassionate and informative throughout. Being in the comfort of home, with familiar surroundings and privacy as a family, made a hard moment more peaceful for everyone—including our dog.

> We recently had to say goodbye to our beloved 16 year-old Havanese. He was terrified of going to the Vet so we decided on in home pet euthanasia. Dr. Meadows and Ashley were so kind and professional. They gave Reiko treats to help ease any anxiety. Dr. Meadows gently administered a fast acting calming medicine. Reiko was able to "Cross the Rainbow Bridge" peacefully in my arms. Ashley brought in a lovely basket to take Reiko with them. It was a very sad experience, but made so much easier by the professional and kind Dr. Meadows and Ashley. Highly recommend them for in home pet euthanasia!

> t’s taken me a while to write this review because of how traumatic this experience was for everyone in my household. I elected to use Coda Pet for my dogs end of life services and I will regret that decision for the rest of my life. This is the uber eats of your dogs end of life services. Do better than me, and really research who you’re going with. A couple good reviews aren’t going to cut it in this situation. Dr Meadows was who our assigned doctor was, and he maybe said 5 words during the entire exchange. He comes in, doesn’t make my dogs feel comfortable at all. Or me for that matter! No communication at all. For example I have one dog who barks at people when they walk in, this was known. She never barks for this long at someone, but she just didn’t like his energy, and never relaxed, and I’ll say she wasn’t wrong for that. The entire process felt rushed. My dog who was being put down, was excited to see him, but no love was exchanged. Just “okay sit down, I have to put this needle in” literally. That’s pretty much what he said. My dog didn’t react well to the sedative. This is when the trauma really started. She yelped in pain, her heart immediately racing. She started running around the kitchen, losing her ability to walk. She was scared, heart racing, and it was truly my worst nightmare. The “Dr” sat on his butt on the floor for the ENTIRETY of this happening. Like isn’t this his actual practice?! Why am I the only one trying to console my poor, terrified dog alone? I was the one who had to pick her up and lay her on the bed and literally beg for euthanasia because of how scared she was. And her heart was racing so so badly. Eventually he got off his ass to administer it, and I said goodbye to her in such a horrible way. When it was time for her to be taken out, he got an assistant, who said she was so sorry, but the Dr himself said not one word. Nothing. I was promised compassion from this company, I did not receive it. I was promised dignity for my pet. She did not receive it. I feel robbed. Of a peaceful passing for my baby girl. I feel overcharged for such a disgusting experience. The only people who showed kindness here was the cremation company that they passed her on to. Coda pet would receive negative stars from me if they could. I called a couple days later to express my disgust, and never heard back. But I guess that’s to be expected from the uber eats of pet euthanasia services. No like literally, my dog was taken out in a jeep. Not a “coda pet” official van or anything. Not even dignity there. Needless to say, this is one of the most traumatic things that has ever happened to me and my best friend. I have to find ways to reduce the guilt I have from choosing this company, and I don’t know if I ever can. Book elsewhere, this place should not get any of your money. And do not let them anywhere near your babies.

> So, it has taken me some time to get around to this, but I think Brandon deserves it. This was the absolute worst experience of my life, saying goodbye to my best friend. But throughout the entirety of it Brandon was courteous, concerned, and overall caring. He made it somewhat tolerable for me, which says a lot. He gave me every minute I needed, and came at a time later than usual at my request. I know it's hard for anyone going through it, but I hope they can have someone like Brandon available to provide it. I am grateful for his service, and have absolutely no complaints. Just know that the passing of your pet can be handled with respect and grace if Brandon has anything to do with it.
