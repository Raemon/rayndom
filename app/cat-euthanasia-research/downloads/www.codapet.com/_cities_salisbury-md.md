Dr. Karen was wonderful. I called her an angel on earth. She was so kind, loving and calming. She was so sweet with our 18 y/o Himalayan cat Cymba. Having her come to our home was very special. She made a terrible moment in time beautiful and peaceful for our cat and for us. We were very emotional and she gave us our time and guided us through the process. Cymba was very ready, very sick and at the end of life. She told us we were giving him a beautiful gift. I appreciated those words more than she will ever know. I don't wish anyone to lose their furry loved ones but if the time comes I highly recommend Dr. Karen.

## Pet euthanasia and cremation pricing in Salisbury, MD

### Reservations and payments

### Cancellation policy or pet passing

We charge cancellation fee of $100 if an appointment is cancelled less than 4 hours before the start time. If your pet passes away before your appointment you would not be charged a cancellation fee. If the vet you scheduled is able, and you would like their assistance with cremation, then pickup fee would apply instead of euthanasia fee

## Other Consideration

### Large Animals

If you have a larger pet, your vet may need the help of one friend or family member. Talk to your vet about options and limitations when they reach out to you prior to your appointment, and they will inform you of any extra cost for your situation. 

### How do I get my pet’s ashes

Options for your pets return home and memorabilia depend on your local provider. Your vet coordinate the return of your pet’s ashes and let you know if there are additional fees for urn delivery. 

### Special factors affecting price

Extra time or medications needed can affect the total price. Other factors can be if it is decided that it’s not time to euthanize your pet after the vet has arrive. In that case, only the travel fee, platform fee, and a quality of life consult would apply. 

## FAQs

### What’s included in the total cost?

The total cost includes the in-home pet euthanasia service fee, any travel fee (if any apply), and a platform fee. Additionally, depending on your choice, fees may apply for cremation services or keepsakes.

### Will the vet take my pet with them after the appointment?

During your appointment, your vet will confirm your aftercare selection with you. If you choose to arrange cremation services, your vet will oversee your pet’s transportation to a local facility for cremation. If your preferred cremation option includes the return of your pet’s ashes to you, your vet will discuss the process to reunite you with your pet's ashes and the anticipated time frame during your appointment

### Will the vet examine my pet once they get to my home?

Yes, upon arrival the veterinarian will assess your pet. This can look different than an “nose to tail” examination in a clinic setting and will focus more on the pet’s history and quality of life.

### What if I am not sure it is time?

It is not uncommon to have doubts about whether the time is right. If you’ve taken the Quality of Life Questionnaire and are still unsure, we recommend consulting with your family veterinarian before scheduling an appointment.  
  
Rest assured, if you book an appointment, your in-home euthanasia veterinarian will let you know if they do not believe that euthanasia is appropriate at this time.

### How long will the procedure take?

You can expect your veterinarian to be in your home from 20-60 minutes, depending on how much of that time you need or want throughout the process.

### What is in home pet euthanasia, and how does it work?

In home pet euthanasia allows your pet to pass away peacefully in the comfort of your home surrounded by love. A compassionate veterinarian will provide end-of-life care for your pet starting with an initial end-of-life exam followed by sedation to ensure your pet is comfortable. Your vet will always move at your pace so you have the time you need to say your goodbyes. Once you are ready, your vet will administer medication to help them gently and painlessly say goodbye surrounded by comfort and love.

### How do I tell if my pet is suffering?

Signs your pet may be suffering include chronic pain, difficulty breathing, loss of appetite, inability to stand or walk, or a loss of interest in daily activities. These symptoms could indicate a decline in their quality of life. You know your pet better than anyone, but speaking to a veterinarian can help you assess whether euthanasia is the most compassionate option. If you feel you need more help, you can read our guide on ‘[How will I know it’s time](https://www.codapet.com/how-will-i-know-when-its-time)’, take a [quality of life assessment](https://www.codapet.com/quality-of-life-scale), or call customer care at **833-263-2738**.

### What should I do if my pet is declining fast?

If your pet's health is declining rapidly, it’s crucial to take the following steps:  


  * **Consult Your Veterinarian** : Schedule an appointment to discuss your observations and any scoring from a quality-of-life scale. This information can help guide the conversation about your pet's condition and options moving forward. Your vet may suggest palliative care, hospice, or, if necessary, euthanasia.  

  * **Ensure Comfort** : Create a quiet, cozy space with soft bedding and easy access to food, water, and a litter box (if applicable).  

  * **Minimize Stress** : Keep routines simple and familiar, and limit loud noises or disruptions.  

  * **Offer Gentle Care** : Provide a soothing touch through gentle petting and offer favorite treats if they can still eat.  

  * **Consider At-Home Euthanasia** : If appropriate, discuss the option of at-home euthanasia with your vet for a peaceful and familiar passing.  

  * **Reach Out for Support** : It's okay to lean on loved ones, pet-loss support groups, or counselors to help navigate this difficult time.



  
If you're noticing signs of declining health, we encourage you to use our [quality of life scale ](https://www.codapet.com/quality-of-life-scale)assessment to evaluate your pet's condition before your vet visit.

### What is the difference between in home pet euthanasia and euthanasia at a vet clinic?

The key difference is the setting. At home euthanasia allows your pet to pass peacefully in the comfort of their familiar surroundings, reducing stress and anxiety. This option especially benefits pets who may feel scared or uncomfortable traveling to a clinic. It also offers your family a private, intimate experience during this emotional time. While some urgent situations don’t allow for time to schedule in-home euthanasia, many pet owners in Salisbury choose in-home services for the peaceful atmosphere and compassionate care their pets receive right where they feel safest. You can [find flexible availability](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment) for our local vets here, or look for [same-day euthanasia](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request) appointments.

### Will my pet experience any pain during euthanasia?

No, pet euthanasia at home is designed to be completely painless. After an initial end-of-life assessment, your veterinarian will first administer a sedative to ensure your pet is relaxed and comfortable. The euthanasia medication then gently stops the heart without causing pain. The process is peaceful and allows your pet to pass without distress.

### Is there an available in home euthanasia service for pets near me?

### Do you provide 24-hour pet euthanasia services?

### Is there an additional fee for after-hours or emergency services?

### How much does in home pet euthanasia cost in my area?

The cost of at home pet euthanasia can vary in Salisbury and the surrounding areas. Once you have picked your provider, the cost will usuallydepend on your pet’s size and any additional services you may choose, such as cremation, keepsakes, or other services. Our services start with a base fee of $335 for at home euthanasia. If your vet is traveling further than their local area, there is a travel fee applied based on how far you are from them. At CodaPet, we believe in giving you complete transparency and control over what you are choosing for your pet’s end-of-life care. This is why you can view a detailed price estimate before you complete reserving a time with your local vet. You can view [flexible availability and detailed pricing](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment) or request a [same-day appointment](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request) if this is more urgent. If you have any further questions, you can view our [FAQs](https://www.codapet.com/faqs) or reach us **(833) 263 - 2738**.

### Is the cost of euthanasia for dogs and cats the same?

Most providers in Salisbury charge a flat fee for euthanasia, although some providers do charge based on the size of your pet, so small dogs and cats can be the same price; however, medium or large-size dogs (such as Bulldogs, Australian Shepherds, Labradors, or German Shepherds) will likely carry a higher price. At CodaPet, most vets charge a flat fee for both dogs and cats; however, if there is a large pet fee, it will be applied automatically for you to review in the price estimate when you reserve an appointment. You can view the detailed [pricing and availability here](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment) or call us at **(833) 263 - 2738**.

### What should I expect during an in home pet euthanasia appointment?

During an in home euthanasia appointment, your veterinarian will make an assessment of your pet’s health and quality of life to provide guidance to ensure your decision is informed. The veterinarian will administer an initial sedative or anesthetic to help your pet relax and become pain-free, ensuring they are comfortable and at ease. In the last stage, your veterinarian will first ensure your pet is fully sedated before gently administering anesthesia which will quickly slow down your pet’s respiratory system until the heart finally stops beating. In most cases, this process takes less than a minute. Your veterinarian will always move at your pace so the process is as comfortable as possible for your pet and your family.

### How far in advance do I need to make an appointment?

The notice for every veterinarian differs, however, most veterinarians require at least a 2-hour notice from the time you need them to arrive at your home. This allows them time to prepare and ensure they can provide the highest level of care and compassion for your pet. It also accounts for their travel time, as your veterinarian may be traveling from many different locations around Salisbury.

  
While you can request a [same-day and emergency services](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request), it's always best to contact us as early as possible to ensure availability and to give both you and your veterinarian time to prepare for this important moment.

### What should I expect in terms of my pet’s behavior during the pet euthanasia process?

During the euthanasia process, your pet will be gently guided to a state of peace and comfort. After a sedative is administered, you can expect them to become calm and relaxed, free from any pain or distress. When the final injection is given, your pet will slowly drift off into a deep sleep before passing away peacefully. Your compassionate veterinarian will ensure the process is as gentle and serene as possible, allowing you to be present with your beloved companion in their final moments of love and care.

### Can I be with my pet during the euthanasia process?

Yes, during the in home euthanasia process, you are encouraged to be with your pet throughout the entire process. Being there provides comfort and reassurance to your pet as they pass peacefully.

### How do I know when it’s time to consider euthanasia for my pet?

Every pet is different, and you know yours better than anyone, however, it may be time to consider euthanasia when you notice more ‘bad days than good’. It’s important to keep an eye on your pet’s quality of life and try to understand when it has declined, such as no longer enjoying activities or suffering from unmanageable pain. To help you understand their quality of life, you take a [Quality of Life Assessment](https://www.codapet.com/quality-of-life-scale), which helps you get a more clear picture of your pet’s well-being at this point in time.

Remember, if you are unsure, speaking with your primary care veterinarian can help better understand your pet’s quality of life. It’s important to speak with your primary care veterinarian if you haven’t yet to understand your pet’s health. If you do not have a primary care veterinarian, consider visiting an urgent care or emergency hospital in your area.

### How should I prepare my home for my pet’s euthanasia?

Everyone’s experience in saying goodbye to their beloved companion is different and very personal. It’s important to consider that you know your pet best. Some considerations, however, are choosing a comfortable space where your pet feels safe, sometimes their favorite spot in your home. Another consideration can be to gather any family members who wish to be present and feel free to bring your pet’s favorite blanket or toys, etc that make them feel comfortable. When your veterinarian arrives they will guide you through each step in the process and help you move at your pace to ensure the process is as peaceful as possible.

### How long does the euthanasia procedure typically take?

At home euthanasia procedures usually take about 10-15 minutes, however, the total time can vary depending on the pace you and your family prefer to move at and your pet’s comfort level. Your veterinarian will take the time necessary to ensure you feel you have enough time to be with your beloved pet while also ensuring your pet is calm and relaxed before proceeding. In some cases, this may take longer, especially if your pet is anxious or uncomfortable.  


We understand that saying goodbye is a deeply emotional experience, and we encourage families to take as much time as they need during the process. Our goal is to create a peaceful and compassionate environment for both you and your pet.

### What should I do after the euthanasia procedure is completed?

After the euthanasia, you are welcome to spend as much time as you need with your pet to say goodbye. If you’ve chosen any cremation services to handle your pet’s body, your veterinarian will reconfirm your choices and gently transport your pet when you are ready. If you’ve chosen any keepsakes offered by the crematorium, like Claw Paw Prints, Ink nose prints, or other memorabilia, your veterinarian will reconfirm your choices before leaving your home. If you have any questions or want to change your mind about any of your choices, you can discuss your options with your veterinarian before they leave your home.

### What are my options for cremation?

After the in home euthanasia procedure, your veterinarian will provide you with time to say goodbye to your pet. Once you're ready, they will re-confirm the preferred aftercare option that you choose when reserving your time with your veterinarian. In Salisbury you can select three types of cremation services:  


  * **Individual Cremation (Ashes Returned)** : An individual cremation is a process where your pet will be cremated separated with physical barriers in the chamber. This ensures the separation with other pets in the chamber so you may reunite with your pet’s ashes. Your pet’s ashes will be returned to you in an urn of your choice. If you choose an additional urn then your pet’s ashes will be returned in the urn of your choice.  

  * **Communal Cremation (No Ashes Returned)** : A communal cremation is a process where your pet is cremated in a chamber with other pets. Once the process is complete, the crematorium will respectfully scatter your pet’s remains among other pets. It’s important to note, you pet’s ashes will not be returned to you.  




Some of our veterinarians offer an additional option known as **Private Cremation (Ashes Returned)**. In this option, only your pet is in the cremation chamber, ensuring that the recovered ashes are solely your pet's. These ashes can be returned in an urn of your choice, with additional urn options available. To see if private cremation is available with your provider, please refer to our [booking page](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment).  


**Note** : If you choose to leave your pet's body with your veterinarian, rest assured it will be handled with the utmost care, respect, and dignity. Your veterinarian will coordinate all aftercare arrangements as requested, allowing you to focus on yourself and your family after this difficult goodbye.

### How do I get my pet’s ashes back?

Your veterinarian will coordinate the return of your pet’s ashes before they leave your home. Your options include having your pet’s remains delivered by your veterinarian (for an additional fee), shipping them to you (for an additional fee), or picking them up from your primary clinic or the crematorium.

### Are there any low-cost or no-cost pet euthanasia solutions?

Saying goodbye to a beloved pet is never easy, and we understand that cost can be a concern for many pet parents. While we specialize in premium in-home euthanasia services, we also want to acknowledge that cost may be a concern. If you're looking for low-cost or no-cost pet euthanasia options in Salisbury, consider reaching out to the following:

  * **Local Animal Shelters & Humane Societies** – Many provide low-cost or donation-based euthanasia services, often with cremation options.
    * **Humane Society of Wicomico County** 5130 Citation Dr, Salisbury, MD 21804410-749-7603  

  * **Low-Cost Veterinary Clinics & Nonprofits** – Some vet clinics and nonprofits offer reduced-cost euthanasia, sometimes supported by grants or donations.  

  * **Animal Control Services** – In certain cases, local animal control agencies may offer euthanasia services for terminally ill or suffering pets at a lower cost.



**Note:** When considering a low-cost pet euthanasia option, it's important to call ahead to check availability, as some providers may require an appointment or have eligibility criteria, such as income-based assistance. Be sure to ask about additional costs, including cremation or aftercare services, which may not be included in the base price. Additionally, verify service details, as some options may have restrictions based on your pet’s size, health condition, or location.

While low-cost options are available, many pet parents choose in-home euthanasia to ensure a peaceful, stress-free farewell in the comfort of their home. If you're looking for a private, compassionate experience, we’re here to help.

> We had a sudden need for home pet euthanasia for our beloved little dog, Jellybean. None of our local vets offered the service timely, so we had to try an unknown. I found CodaPet online and there were appointments available. Dr. Gordon at CodaPet was wonderful. The whole process went smoothly. Communication was thorough. She was a little late, but kept us updated (because you can't rush these things). She said all the right things and comforted us in our decision. We are heartbroken, but at least this part will be a good memory. Our pup was at home, peaceful, and not stressed out by being at the vet. We pet him, cried, told stories, and he just fell asleep. People who provide this service are special people. We SO appreciated being home for his final day. We would not hesitate to recommend Dr. Gordon if you unfortunately need this service.

> Dr. Karen Duncan is a loving beautiful soul, an angel. Words cannot express our sincere gratitude. She was so kind, caring and compassionate walking us through the entire process. Having to euthanize a fur baby is one of the hardest things to do. Dr. Karen understood how hard this was for us to lose our sweet 16-year-old kitty, Mickey. She took the time to listen, let us share how special our fur baby Mickey was/is. Her presence and demeanor made all of us feel comfortable. We were able to pet Mickey and love him up in his last final moments – a true blessing as we know he passed peacefully and gracefully. Dr. Karen gave us time to say one last final goodbye, making sure his younger brothers and sister had time to say goodbye as well. She then, with the utmost of kindness, wrapped Mickey in a blanket and placed him in a beautiful basket. We highly recommend Dr. Karen to anyone who loves their pet as family and is faced with the difficult decision to euthanize.

She is so kind and respectful and she values the love you two share. I highly suggest that if you are considering this option you let Dr. Amanda help you.

> Words cannot express our gratitude and appreciation for the service that Dr. Mays and her company provided to our family. If and when the time comes to make that hurtful decision, Dr. Mays and the Coda company are the best to consider. Thanks once again for helping my family & me ease through this transition. Phd

> Dr. Karen Duncan was the most sensitive, caring and gentle person we could have had to put our dear Moet down. Having this done in our home was so less stressful both for her and for us than taking her to a vet's office. She carefully explained everything beforehand and as she went through the process. Afterward she carefully wrapped our little one in a cozy blanket and put her in a soft basket. We couldn't be more grateful. Thank you so much, Karen.

> For starters, Dr. Duncan is a wonderful person. She makes herself available, and then takes all the time one needs, and is such a calming and loving leader during the end of life services. Our dog was never stressed nor did he experience any pain or scary moment throughout. My wife and I felt at peace as we said our goodbyes. Dr. Duncan's role made all the difference in the world and she is highly recommended for your pet's (and your) needs.

> Amazing. I went online in the morning at 6am and scheduled for 11am. They even have a link for more urgent response. Dr. Alex was incredibly compassionate and professional. I had never heard of this service before and my friend recommended it. Hands down this is the only way i will ever do this again. The gratitude i have for Dr. Alex and her service cannot be understated. I was very moved by the experience. My kitty had zero stress; i placed her on my lap while i sat on the bed. Dr. Alex was so gentle and kind. I cannot praise enough. Thank you so much.

> We had to make the incredibly hard decision to put our cat down, and Dr. Diana was truly wonderful. She was kind, compassionate, and never rushed us. She gave us the time and space we needed and treated our cat with such care and dignity. I especially appreciated that she brought a basket to carry our cat after she had passed. It was a small detail, but it meant a lot during such an emotional moment. I am very grateful for her gentleness and professionalism.

> After making the difficult decision to help our elderly bulldog cross the rainbow bridge, we found CodaPet online, offering in-home euthanasia. Our dog was a large breed and could hardly walk, and I couldn’t bear the thought of transporting her to a cold clinic for her final moments with us. Dr. Michelli arrived at our home and was so kind and gentle with our sweet girl; she explained to us how things would work and gave us time to answer any questions. We were so thankful to be able to say our final goodbyes to our fur baby in the privacy of our home and with her in the comfort of her own bed. Our hearts are broken by the loss, but I couldn’t have wished for a better way to have gone about this experience. Thank you, Dr. M and CodaPet. 🙏🏻🌈

> In-home pet euthanasia. Saying good-bye to Micky was one of the most difficult days of my life. Dr. Karen arrived at our home and I could tell she was heaven sent. Her warmth, caring and concern from the moment we met was comforting. She was in contact with us a few days prior to help us prepare. Even though Micky was somewhat sedated already, she greeted him with a soft touch and a quiet hello. He even gave her a really good side stretch. We sat and chatted about our life with Micky until it was time. The three step process was gentle and quiet. We held Micky's head and petted him though the whole process. He went so quietly and peacefully. Since we were having him cremated, Dr. Karen had a small stretcher to carry him out on. The stretcher as covered in the softest, comfiest blanket. We wrapped Micky in it and he was carried out to her car. When we went out to say good-bye to Micky one more time, she had placed a remembrance sign and stone near him. It was perfect and he was at peace. If you choose to have Dr. Karen come to your home, I highly recommend Coda Pet services.

> Using CodaPet was so easy; from searching for a vet near me to clear pricing. Once booked they remained in constant communication with me throughout the process, providing time updates, etc. Our family was matched with Dr.Kelsey Jones and I can not recommend her enough. She arrived promptly, listened to our concerns, examined our furbaby Ciddy and gave us ample time to grieve and make the final decision. At no moment did I feel pressured to rush. She gave us time to set up an area outside and spoke to us like a friend throughout the process, while treating all of us with respect and compassion. She even made a suggestion on how to allow our other dog to say goodbye (which I would never have thought of). It’s not an easy choice to let go of a beloved pet but i feel this was the best way to do it and highly recommend her services.

> Dr. Karen did an amazing job. She sat with the whole family to discuss memories and asked questions. She walked through the process step by step and handled our Family Pet as if it was her own. Can say enough about how she helped our family grieve during this difficult time. We didn't know a service like this existed and would highly recommend to any family during their difficult time of letting go.
