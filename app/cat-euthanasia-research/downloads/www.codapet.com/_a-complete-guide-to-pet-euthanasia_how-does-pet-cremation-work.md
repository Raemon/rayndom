When it comes time to say goodbye, decisions need to be made about aftercare. Learn how pet cremation works and if it's right for your pet.

Dealing with the loss of a beloved pet is hard. At this moment of sadness, you want to honor the bond you shared and give them a proper memorial. Making a decision about [aftercare](https://www.codapet.com/pet-cremation-near-me) can be challenging if you don't have enough information. If you find yourself wondering, "how does pet cremation work?" let us help you.

This article is intended to provide readers with helpful information regarding pet cremation options, how the process works, what happens after pet cremation, and if this is the right aftercare choice for you.

## **What Are the Different Pet Cremation Options?**

There are two standard [pet cremation options](https://www.codapet.com/pet-cremation-near-me): communal cremation and individual cremation. At CodaPet, we offer both so pet parents can pick the one that fits their needs better. Keep reading to learn more about each of these options.

### **Communal Cremation**

The first type of pet cremation service is communal cremation. This option is ideal for pet parents who do not wish to scatter their pet's ashes nor want to keep them in an urn.

With communal cremation, your pet is cremated alongside other pets. The combined ashes are later respectfully spread on the grounds of the pet crematory.

This approach can be comforting as you think about your pet in the company of other well-loved animals. Additionally, communal cremation costs are lower than the cost of individual cremation for pets of the same weight.

### **Individual Cremation**

Individual cremation is ideal for those who want to keep their pet's ashes. There are two options commonly available: partitioned and private cremation.

Partitioned cremation is a process in which the pet is cremated alongside other animals, but they are separated from one another. As a result, you can ask for your pet's ashes to be returned to you. It is important to note, however, that in partitioned cremation there is a chance ashes from other animals might be mixed with your pet's.

The private service allows your pet's cremation separately with the return of their ashes in an urn. During the process, your pet will have a space designated just for them, while you and your family will be provided a room where you can hold a ceremony. Once you’ve received the urn, you may wish to display it or scatter your pet's ashes in a favorite location. Because it allows for more customization as well as privacy, the service comes with an increased cost.

[CodaPet offers a price estimator](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment) to ease your difficult journey and help you find the best end-of-life and aftercare options for your pet. 

## **What Happens To Your Pet Ashes After Cremation?**

What happens with your pet's ashes after they are cremated depends on which pet cremation process you choose.

If you opt for communal cremation, your pet's ashes will be ceremoniously scattered along with the ashes of fellow beloved pets on the grounds of the pet crematory. If you choose to have your pet individually or privately cremated, their ashes will be collected and returned to you in an urn.

Many pet parents opt for individual cremation services because it allows them to keep their pet's ashes with them or have them turned into jewelry or other keepsakes.

## ‍**When Cremation Is the Right Choice for Your Pet**

Cremation is not the only aftercare option for your pet. Some pet parents prefer other methods such as taxidermy, donating their pet's body to science, or burying them (so long as the burial complies with local licensure and regulations).

There is no single right answer. The choice should be based on what better fits your needs. Cremation is an affordable, accessible and convenient option. It is also ideal for pet parents who want a keepsake urn to honor their pet’s memory for years to come.

If you decide cremation is the right aftercare choice for your pet, [our vets can help you through all steps](https://www.codapet.com/services), from finding a crematory to handling transportation.
