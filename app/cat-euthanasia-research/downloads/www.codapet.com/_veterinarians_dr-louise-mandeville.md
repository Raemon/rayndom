Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I became a vet to help animals that are suffering, but when that help no longer works, we can provide the last kind of gift to our pets through humane euthanasia. In emergency clinics, we see a lot of life-and-death situations and do our best to provide a peaceful ending when the time comes. However, if time allows, nothing beats having our loved ones pass in the peace and comfort of our own homes surrounded by their loved ones. I aim to provide this service without interfering in a pet parent's moment to say goodbye.

> Our experience with Dr Louise Mandeville was extremely positive. She was calm and explained everything every step of the way. No hurrying us even though it was a last minute Saturday appointment. Eva felt no pain and she peacefully died in her Daddy's arms.

> Dr. Louise Mandeville made this difficult experience the best it could've been. We were made as comfortable as we could've been. We know our Louie is in a good place. I wouldn't wish this situation for any pet lover but if need be, I would highly recommend Dr. Louise Mandeville.

> I recently had to say goodbye to my little chihuahua, Frank. He was elderly and it was his time. It’s such a difficult decision to make, I was so heartbroken about it. My home experience with Dr. Mandeville was so peaceful for Frank and myself. She was so kind and patient with us. I couldn’t have asked for a better experience in saying goodbye to my little guy. It was so important to me to be with him as he passed letting him know how much he was loved. I feel so at peace about the experience.
