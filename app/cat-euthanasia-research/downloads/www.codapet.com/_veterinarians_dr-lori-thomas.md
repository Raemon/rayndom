Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

My love of animals first drew me to work as a veterinary assistant and eventually train to become an RVT. It was as I was learning to care for animals in this capacity that I realized that I wanted to learn and do more, so my attention turned to becoming a veterinarian. I have been fortunate to be able to use my education to care for dogs and cats for almost 35 years, 19 of those as a veterinarian. My transition from general practice to providing in home euthanasia stems from my belief that we owe our beloved pets, who have given us so much love and happiness, a peaceful transition of their own in familiar, loving surroundings.

> We're so grateful for the experience we had with Dr. Thomas when we had to say goodbye to our senior cat, Maica. It was incredibly painful to see Maica suffering from rapidly increased symptoms of her advanced kidney disease, and we weren't expecting to have to say goodbye to her at the time we did. Dr. Thomas was deeply empathetic and kind with both us and Maica, and during our appointment she gave us plenty of information and time to process both the procedure and Maica's passing. It means the world that we could spend Maica's final moments with her, making sure she felt safe and loved until the end. I would recommend Dr. Thomas to anyone who unfortunately has to make this difficult decision, and even though we miss Maica deeply, it helps to know she was shepherded on with such care.

This was one of the most difficult decisions to make and I am truly thankful to have found Dr Lori Thomas to help me through it. I know Joe is now not in pain and watching over us still. ❤️

> I cannot say enough about how wonderful Dr. Thomas was when it came time to say goodbye to my beloved dog, Baululah. Dr. Thomas came to our home and provided such kind, compassionate, and therapeutic care during an incredibly difficult moment. Everything was handled so gently and thoughtfully, and Baululah passed peacefully in her familiar space, surrounded by love. As a large dog, getting her to a veterinary office would have been stressful and uncomfortable for her, so having Dr. Thomas come to us made all the difference. Dr. Thomas also offered a beautiful paw print and picture to remember Baululah at no additional cost — a gesture that meant much to us.

> Codapet's assistance with my beloved Kaiser, German Shepherd, was unbelievably wonderful. Kaiser kept smiling and doing the best he could with his crippled legs till the very end. I contacted 5 companies to come home to help with Kaiser, they were cruel and heartless. Then I contact Codapet and they sent Dr. Lori Thomas Dr. Lori organized every little detail that made that awful day a little bit better, she bought treats for Kaiser and made a paw print. [I'm sorry, but just thinking about her makes me cry.] She was so KIND, patience, effective warm, empathetic, sympathetic, and a champion of humanity. In her automobile, Dr. Lori wrapped Kaiser in a blue blanket as if he were heading to paradise. With a corrosive pain in the following days, Codapet's miss J comforted me, sending many several ongoing messages of comfort and hope for a rainbow in my future. She shared stories of her own pets. She made my grief a bit better and she show tremendous support through all the grieving time. For Christmas she sent videos of her lovely dog UK, opening presents, so then I also did gifts for my 2 girls German Shepards I have (they also suffered with K departure). I was not able to write about this until now. However I shared my experience of Codapet with many. Kaiser untill I see you at the rainbow Love Elizabeth Codapet THANKS THANKS and Thanks

> Needless to say, losing my 16 year old kitty, Tama was devastating. I knew I didn't want his life to end in a cold sterile room that he hated going to, so I sought out at-home pet euthanasia when I knew it was time. Dr. Lori was who I reached out to (randomly) and from that first message, her texts were mindful of the place I was at mentally and emotionally. Dr. Lori comes to my home the very next day, her energy is kind, empathetic, gentle, and professional, which is important when trusting a human for such a difficult job. I was an absolute mess, yet she came in and explained everything. Was sweet to my boy, to me. She was swift and offered me keepsakes, which she was respectful about collecting always asking me if everything she did was ok with me. I'm grateful for her and recommend her as a caring transition doula for our sweet fur babies when the time comes.

> Dr Lori Thomas has been a part of my pet family care team for more than 10 years. I have been lucky to have her care for my cats and dogs and most recently when my dear Riley was showing signs of aging and other neurological issues I knew that there was no one else that I wanted to be there other than Dr. Thomas . Dr. Thomas has always been extremely professional, insightful, caring. and mindful of my pets and their quality of life. My experience with Codapet was very warm and friendly. The staff was amazing at taking my calls and patient when answering all of my questions . Dr. Thomas was extremely thorough and engaged throughout the process. For such a difficult time, I felt at ease and I knew that my Riley was at peace. From scheduling the appointment to the actual event and even the beautiful paw print and card afterwards, I was very appreciative and grateful for the love and kindness that was shared. Thank you, Dr. Thomas and Codapet.

I held my baby through the whole thing and will never ever use a vet office to put any of my babies to sleep. Lori guided us through each step and even when she was taking Mia to the cremation place she put her on a wonderful blanket and stretcher. Dr. Lori Thomas is an angel, my baby loved her and was so at ease with her! Thank you guys. It was worth every penny!

I will certainly call again when the time comes. Aside from the actual home visit, the scheduling was easy, and there was a lot of nice follow up both before and after the Vet's arrival. All options and cost were made clear ahead of time. The procedure itself was well-explained, and we were never hurried at all. Wonderful company.

> The death of our dear Kuyper was difficult but made so much easier and less stressful by Dr. Lori Thomas. She is amazing in her thoughtfulness, caring, and respect for us and our sweet boy. He was actually happy to see her as she was a guest to our house and he received all the attention he loved while we discussed his end of life passing and prepared to ease him from his pain and difficulty breathing. She sat with him and petted him and provided so much caring. He was not stressed at all. He passed peacefully and we all felt his escape. She also was so gentle and respectful with his remains as she tucked him into a soft basket with a fuzzy blanket around him. It was the most beautiful experience, and we have never felt so eased by the process before. We have needed to euthanize several dogs over the years and it has never been this beautiful. I worked in hospice in my career and it reminded me of what we always tried to achieve for our patients. We are so grateful to Dr. Lori and CodaPet for offering this amazing service. We cannot say enough good about it. We thank you from the bottoms of our hearts.

I'm thankful we were able to give Baxter a calm, comfortable, and dignified transition at home.

> I want to thank Dr. Lori Thomas so much for her kindness and compassion. She helped my partner and I see our beautiful boy, Hobart, across the rainbow bridge this past October, and was so great at balancing the realities of paperwork with the comfort and care we needed to feel like our cat was given the best seeing-off we could possibly give him. It was not my first time saying goodbye to a pet, but it was my partner's first time, and we were both really impressed with how well everything was handled. We still cried, of course, but the experience was so much different and better in-home than it would have been elsewhere. I was so touched by the way Dr. Thomas carried Hobart to her car in a beautiful, cushioned basket with all of the flowers we laid on his body as well as one of his favorite toys. Seeing him placed right in the passenger seat in the sunlight was the best way I can imagine seeing him in his last moments. Thank you, Dr. Thomas.

> All things considered, the experience we had in using CodaPet to arrange for our dear Bella’s departure and in working with Dr Lori Thomas was wonderful. Her calm presence, capability in assessing our puppy and providing gentle guidance throughout the visit and entire process was welcome and appreciated. Highly recommend if you value giving your fur baby their dignity in your own home and comfort that they will be well taken care of before and after the procedure ends. Cannot thank Dr Thomas enough for her kindness and compassion along with us as we mourn our loss. We are at ease knowing Bella was well cared for in her final moments with the support of Dr Thomas for all of us.

> We had our dog Astro for 15 years, he was actually 16, we picked him up from the local animal shelter when he was one. He helped raise all of our children, and was a huge part of our family, loved by all. When the time came, and we had to let him go, we were unsure what to do. But we chose Codapet, because we really wanted him to pass at home, not after a car ride to a veterinarian, even though we always had good experiences with our vet. Lori Thomas was so professional, so kind, and guided us through the process. There were tears of love but he passed at home, with his family at his side. I can’t thank Lori enough, she made it as special as you could. It has taken me a few months to write this review, not because I was not totally satisfied with the process, but I was just not ready to talk about losing Astro. Thank you Lori.

> Dr. Thomas was compassionate and has a gentle demeanor that made my cat Domingo's passing peaceful. She explained the procedure clearly and gave me time to process in the moment what was happening. I was grateful to have held him as he passed in our home. I would recommend to any pet parent that if it is economically feasible on their end, to opt for an at home euthanasia.

> Dr.Thomas was extremely patient with this wish-washy dog mom. She took time to discuss with the family, and gave us time and space to make the final decision. She was extremely gentle with my Freckles, and made her passing calm and pain free.

> Dr. Thomas was wonderful. I could not have asked for a better experience. She was kind, thoughtful, and explained everything she was doing. I was nervous to include my 5year old who wanted to be present , but Dr. Thomas brought treats for her to feed our dog and keep him distracted and that helped tremendously for both my daughter to feel included and my dog to be comfortable. I am so grateful we got to do this at home. Thank you.

> Dr. Lori Thomas was amazing! So sincerely compassionate and gentle with myself, my family, and my dog. She never rushed and allowed us the time to say goodbye to our girl. And allowing her to pass in the comfort of her own home/bed was so important to me. Thank you for this amazing service you provide!!

> We are so grateful for the compassionate care we received during such a difficult time. Dr. Lori Thomas was—wonderful, so kind, patient and understanding. She brought her own treats to help make our pet feel comfortable, and she gave us all the time and space we needed to say goodbye in our own way. She handled everything gently with great respect. It truly felt like our pet was treated with love and dignity we couldn’t have asked for a better person to help us through this moment.

> Dr. Lori was very professional and explained everything exactly as to what she was going to do and how my Honey was going to react. Dr. Lori made Honey relax and calm by giving her a treat and talking to her while Dr. Lori injected a sedative which Honey was fast asleep in a minute or two. She then proceeded with the euthanizing shot. Honey passed away in just about a minute without any problems. I was very saddened but my Honey was in no more pain. Thank you Dr. Lori for making this a lot easier for me to handle making Honey pass away so calmly and quickly.

> I was so grateful for the professionalism and empathy Dr. Lori Thomas showed me during such a difficult time. This is the hardest thing that pet owners have to deal with, but it does lessen the pain to have a caring vet in your home, helping your beloved oet pass. My girl left this life peacefully with me by her side. It comforts me to know she felt secure and not afraid as she quietly went to sleep.

> I can't Thank Dr Lori enough!! You communicated with me through a text and a phone call prior to our appointment. You came on time and you got right to work because you knew my boy was in need. Thank you thank you so much! I will refer you to everybody and anybody when in need. Thank you for the biggest hug ever. And thank you for the paw prints. Adding Smokey's name and the time and date was amazing.

> Needless to say, losing my 16 year old kitty, Tama was devastating. I knew I didn't want his life to end in a cold sterile room that he hated going to, so I sought out at-home pet euthanasia when I knew it was time. Dr. Lori was who I reached out to (randomly) and from that first message, her texts were mindful of the place I was at mentally and emotionally. Dr. Lori comes to my home the very next day, her energy is kind, empathetic, gentle, and professional, which is important when trusting a human for such a difficult job. I was an absolute mess, yet she came in and explained everything. Was sweet to my boy, to me. She was swift and offered me keepsakes, which she was respectful about collecting always asking me if everything she did was ok with me. I'm grateful for her and recommend her as a caring transition doula for our sweet fur babies when the time comes.
