Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

Before starting veterinary school, I lost my mother to cancer. Being with her at home during her final days showed me the importance of comfort and peace during life’s hardest moments. It was through that lens that I came to appreciate the unique role hospice and home euthanasia can play—not just in human medicine, but in veterinary care as well. Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of guiding more than 1,000 families through the final moments of their beloved pets’ lives. Each one of those moments has mattered deeply. Providing peaceful, dignified end-of-life care in the comfort of a family’s home isn’t just my specialty—it’s my calling. Although I also currently work in a small animal practice, I continue to recognize something that no clinical setting can replicate: the comfort of home. Despite our best efforts in the office, there’s a level of peace and presence that only exists where pets feel most safe. My calm presence, empathy, and genuine compassion are what I bring to those moments. I don’t take that responsibility lightly. It’s an honor to walk beside families when it matters most.

> Dr Peek was great! We had to put down our 11.5 year old Great Dane and decided to try this in home service. It was the best way to go through this hard process. Our dog was able to lie on his bed with all of us around. It was very peaceful. I highly recommend this service.
