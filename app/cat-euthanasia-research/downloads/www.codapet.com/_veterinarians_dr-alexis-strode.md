Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I have always had a connection with animals and an affinity for science. Becoming a veterinarian was a goal of mine as long as I can remember. Through my practice I support a lot of senior pets to help them be as comfortable as possible and give them a good quality of life near the end. I see these patients regularly and really get to know the pet and family. This along with my own experience with my own geriatric dog has lead me to want to make the end of life as comfortable as possible for the pet and owner. A clinic setting can be very stressful for both pet and owner at the time of euthanasia, I love that in home euthanasia can be an option for a more peaceful transition with less stress on the pet.
