Pet Health

A pet’s quality of life can change suddenly due to illness, injury, or age-related decline, leaving owners unsure of what to do next. This article explains common reasons for rapid health changes, signs to watch for, and how to assess your pet’s comfort level. When it’s time to say goodbye, CodaPet’s compassionate in-home euthanasia services help pets pass peacefully in the comfort of their homes.

## **Key Takeaways**

  * Sudden health changes in pets can stem from injury, organ failure, cancer, or mobility issues, making it essential to monitor symptoms like breathing difficulty, seizures, or appetite loss.
  * Regularly using tools like CodaPet’s Quality of Life Scale helps track your pet’s comfort and determine when it may be time to consider treatment or euthanasia.
  * CodaPet offers in-home euthanasia and urgent appointments, ensuring pets can pass peacefully at home surrounded by love and familiarity.



You know your pet is getting older, and they are different than they used to be. Slower. More cuddly. You know one day you will have to say goodbye, but that day seems far in the future. What happens when they seem to worsen rapidly overnight?

## **Understanding Why Quality of Life May Suddenly Change**

There are 4 common reasons why a pet’s quality of life may suddenly change.

  1. Injury, accident, or toxin- Injuries like broken limbs, trauma from vehicle accidents, or toxin ingestion are common causes of young or otherwise healthy pets to rapidly become seriously ill.
  2. Mobility changes- Pets with arthritis or nervous system issues can sometimes worsen quickly, as their disease has reached the point that their body can no longer compensate. These pets may suddenly become unable to walk or stand.
  3. Cyclical nature of organ failure- Pets that suffer from chronic illnesses like liver failure, kidney failure, or heart failure can experience a cycle of improving and worsening multiple times before they reach a point from which they cannot recover.
  4. Cancer diagnosis- With many types of cancer, pets do well for a short time and then rapidly decline over a few short days or weeks.



If your pet has been diagnosed with an illness or organ failure, your regular veterinarian will often give you a good idea of what to expect.

## **What Sudden Changes Should I Watch For?**

Many people religiously monitor their pet’s appetite. While this is useful, there are other symptoms we should also look for, among them:

  * seizures
  * difficulty breathing
  * inability to stand
  * urinating or defecating in the house or all over themselves
  * white gums
  * sudden enlargement of the abdomen
  * highlighter yellow eyes and gums
  * suddenly worsening in coughing



All of these symptoms can be seen in both dogs and cats. An additional symptom to monitor for in cats is open mouth breathing. Panting in cats is never normal, and a cat that is breathing with his or her mouth open accompanied by large belly movements is struggling for air.

## **What if my Young Pet Suddenly is Very Sick?**

Unfortunately, sometimes young animals will become sick very rapidly. A dog ingests rat bait, a cat gets hit by a car, a litter of puppies becomes ill due to parvovirus infection. All of these and more are common reasons why an owner may rush a young animal in to a hospital for emergency care. Especially in cases of younger animals, it is important to work closely with your veterinarian to see what diagnostics and treatments are possible. 

In many cases, even very sick young animals can be successfully treated. However, it is possible that there is not a treatment available that will give your pet a good chance of returning to a normal life. With your veterinarian’s guidance, you may find yourself with a difficult choice- do I consider euthanasia for a young pet?

## **How Can I Assess Quality of Life?**

There are multiple online tools to help assess a pet’s quality of life. When a pet is diagnosed with organ failure or cancer, it can be useful to periodically asses their quality of life weekly or monthly so you can track any changes that may occur.

When a pet suddenly worsens, an online assessment can help you decide if you would like to pursue further treatment, or if the quality of life has worsened to a point where euthanasia is a viable option. Codapet developed our very own QoL analysis tool. [Click here to check it out.](https://www.codapet.com/quality-of-life-scale)

## **Who Can I Call When My Pet’s Health Gets Worse?**

If you would like to pursue further diagnostics and treatment, please call your regular veterinarian or an after-hours emergency clinic in your area. If your pet is experiencing seizures or difficulty breathing, please rush them in right away. Do not wait overnight for your regular vet to open in the morning.

If you and your family or you and your veterinarian have decided that further treatment is not what is best for your pet, humane euthanasia is often a kind choice for your furry friend.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **What is palliative care for pets?**

  
Palliative care focuses on keeping pets comfortable when curative treatment is no longer possible. It includes pain management, mobility support, and emotional comfort to enhance quality of life during advanced illness.

### **Can diet or hydration help improve my pet’s quality of life?**

  
Yes. Proper nutrition and hydration can ease discomfort for pets with chronic illnesses like kidney or liver disease. Your veterinarian can recommend specific diets or supplements that support your pet’s condition.

### **What emotional support is available for pet owners after euthanasia?**

  
Pet loss can be deeply emotional, and grief support resources such as counseling, pet loss hotlines, or online support groups can help. Many families also find comfort in memorializing their pets through keepsakes or private ceremonies.
