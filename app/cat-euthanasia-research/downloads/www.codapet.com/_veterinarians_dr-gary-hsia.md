Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I believe precious memories with your pet should never be overshadowed by a stressful goodbye. I have firsthand experience with the stress of saying goodbye to my first dog, Willy, at the clinic, and since then being able to say goodbye to two other dogs at home. This is why a peaceful passing at home is so important to me.

## What pet parents are saying

> If you’re considering in-home euthanasia, Dr. Gary Hsia is the person you want by your side. I had to say goodbye to my Great Dane — my lifelong best friend — and I truly couldn’t have asked for a more compassionate, peaceful experience. Dr. Hsia’s empathy was immediate and genuine. He walked into my home with calm, care, and deep respect for the bond I had with my dog. He didn’t rush anything. He gave us space, time, and dignity. The entire process felt gentle and sacred, which is exactly what my best friend deserved after a lifetime of unconditional love. If you’re facing this heartbreaking decision, know that it can be peaceful — and Dr. Hsia made that possible. I wouldn’t do it any other way. Forever grateful, —Erica

> Dr. Hsia is the BEST! He is very understanding and caring and you can tell he loves animals! My 2 year old English Bulldog was suffering from some Neuro issues and had some aggression he was dealing with. It was such a difficult decision to have to put our Cody down for Behavioral Euthanasia. We knew he was not living his best life and he knew it also. We did not want him to suffer any longer. After months of training, medications, holistic approaches and much more we gave tried nothing seemed to work for him. We contacted Dr. Hsia’s office and from his team to the doctor we made the right decision. He did not even suffer one bit through the process. We never would want to call him again, but I definitely recommend him 100%! Thanh you again Dr. Gary for helping Cody! We cannot thank you enough!

> I recently had to make the very painful decision to choose in home pet euthanasia for my beautiful black lab. Cancer is a total train wreck of a disease, and my dog was in horrendous pain. Dr. Gary was the most calm and collected person. He took the time to explain the process, and to help with simple better care options/advice during my dog's last days. The process was quick, but not rushed. Dr. Gary was kind and gave my family plenty of time and space to process what was happening. As much as I wish this service was never needed, Codapet has found the way to make this horrible process a little easier, and I appreciate them for doing so. Thank you Dr. Gary and Codapet

He explained every step of the process and let us take as much time as we needed to say our final goodbyes. I would recommend him to everyone. I would give him 10 stars if I could. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

> I cannot express enough gratitude for the care and compassion shown by Dr. Gary Hsia during one of the most difficult moments. From the very beginning, communication was excellent—he responded quickly when I needed to move up my appointment and made the process smooth and stress-free. Dr. Hsia was incredibly professional, offering clear and gentle explanations throughout the euthanasia process in a way that my grieving mind could truly understand and process. But more than anything, I would give 10 out of 5 stars for his genuine care—not just for my beloved cat, but for me as well. His presence was calm, kind, and comforting, and I felt fully supported every step of the way. The online scheduling system was also incredibly easy to use, which made everything more manageable during such an emotional time. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I couldn't have asked for a better experience under such heartbreaking circumstances.

> Making the choice to do at home pet euthanasia was incredibly difficult; having to choose to say goodbye to my dog was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do, but CodaPet made the whole process smooth and comforting for not just our Red but for our whole family as well. Dr.Gary was incredibly kind and compassionate, explaining the process thoroughly and giving us however much time we needed to send Red off. We were able to shower him with love and hold him in his final moments. We miss him so much, but I am certain he is truly at peace. Thank you so much to Dr.Gary and CodaPet.

> We recently made the very difficult decision to help our beloved 18-year-old cat, Phoebe, cross the rainbow bridge. Wanting this to be as peaceful as possible—for her and for our family—we invited Dr. Gary Hsia into our home to guide us through her final farewell. From the beginning, Dr. Gary was kind, compassionate, and communicative. He made sure we had all the information we needed ahead of time and was incredibly respectful of our wishes. During the visit, he talked us through every step of the process with care and gave us all the time we needed to say our goodbyes. I can’t recommend Dr. Gary highly enough. Saying goodbye to a pet is never easy, but being able to do so in the comfort of your own home, surrounded by love and familiarity, made a world of difference. We are grateful for his presence and professionalism during such an emotional time.

You can tell he really cares about animals immensely. Being able to be there with our dog in our home where he is most comfortable was the silver lining of an awful situation.

When it was time to say goodbye to my beloved Darla, Dr. Hsia provided an at-home experience that was gentle, peaceful, and dignified. He walked us through every step with patience and empathy, ensuring Darla was comfortable and surrounded by love in her final moments.

> We recently used Dr. Gary to bid farewell to my beloved dog, Monkey. This dog was THE best dog (everyone says it and everyone is right). He saw me through every moment of my adult life- joy, trauma, sickness, and grief- and I was adamant that he have the best possible experience to cross the rainbow bridge. He deserved the world and more, so in my soul I felt certain that in home euthanasia would be the best option for his comfort. I underestimated what a truly peaceful, stress-free experience it would be. Dr. Gary was incredibly kind, patient, and professional, and truly cared for Monkey’s comfort from beginning to end. Opting to put Monkey down in the comfort of his home and his mama’s lap alleviated so much anxiety for our dog, and for each member of our family. Dr. Bethany was equally lovely to work with when she returned our boy’s ashes to us. I would recommend this service, and Dr. Gary and Dr. Bethany, to anyone who has to make the gut-wrenching decision to bid farewell to their pet.

> On 5/7/25, our 13.5 year old Lab, Max was taking a turn for the worst, and began to suffer, after 5 days of unable to eat or drink on his own. We decided the most humane thing to do was to help Max pass on. After contacting other Vets we have worked with and unable to get anyone put to our house for at least over 24 hours, we found Dr. Gary on Codapet at 6:00 AM and he was able to come out at 10:00 AM. The scheduling processing online was easy and quick. Dr. Gary contacted us within couple hours to confirm the appointment. Dr. Gary arrived at our house early, and was professional and respectfully supportive. He took time to exam our boy Max and explain his assessment and the procedure to us. It was a difficult and emotional time for my wife and I, but Dr. Gary had really made it comforting and supportive for us. Dr. Gary demeanor was really of someone who cares for animals. Dr.Gary had provided us ample time to say goodbye to our beloved boy Max. Once we decided that is was time, Dr. Gary began the procedure. Max's pain eased quickly and easily. Max drifted into sleep, then passed on peacefully and quietly. Once Max passed on, Dr. Gary suggested that we bring our second dog, who we had kept at our neighbors house during Max's passing, back to the house to say goodbye to Max. Dr. Gary explained that it would help our second dog from any confusion, if he came home and suddenly his brother was no longer there. We thought the suggestion was very thoughtful and kind. We appreciate that very much. We have had other pets gone through euthanasia in the past at the vet office, but this at-home passing with the assistance of Dr. Gary was definitely most positive, peaceful, and kind! Euthanizing a loving pet is never an easy decision, but with this experience with Dr. Gary helping our beloved Max to pass so peacefully at home, we truly believed that it was the most loving and humane thing we could have done for our Max! Thank you Dr. Gary!

> If it is possible for a pet to have a beautiful death, that is what Dr.. Gary Hsia created for our beloved Cody. He texted me several times to ensure I was ready and check if I had any questions. He arrived to the minute. I of course was a bit of a mess, but he carried out the process with such care and ensuring I was ok. Cody slipped away in his favorite spot with his stuffed animal tucked in close. He appeared to experience no pain at any time. He passed away so peacefully it was indeed such a gift. I have had to put down several dogs in my life, but doing this in the comfort of my home, where Cody did not need to be aware of anything, no struggle to the vet hospital, just snuggle in-was amazing. Dr.. Hsia came to my house a week later to give me Cody’s ashes in a ,lovely carved wooden box. The whole experience was truly incredible. Rest in Peace dear Cody thanks to Dr. Hsia.

Macy our 12 year old family dog got to eat scrambled eggs for breakfast and steak for lunch. All 3 of our other dogs got to lay next to her as the doctor did his thing. It was a very beautiful experience for the whole family. Thank you Dr. Hsia

I have shared his information with all my family and friends so they have the same opportunity to say goodbye to their pet in the comfort of their own home. He also delivered her ashes back to me, we never had to drive anywhere. We can’t thank him enough for the support he provided us.

It was the first time I have ever had to euthanize a pet at home, and I will never take another pet of mine to a vet to euthanize them ever again. The peace and less stress for such a painful thing, was well worth having this done in the home my girl and I shared.

I truly appreciated his sincereness and could sense his compassion for pets. Dr. Gary was a blessing during this extremely heartbreaking time.

> Dr. Gary Hsia was extremely hands on with us. Our girl was young and initially he gave us some dietary and medical assistance to try and alleviate her struggle somewhat and prolong her life. He even went into my pantry and helped me with her dietary requirements. In spite of this follow through not helping her circumstances, I appreciate that he gave me an opportunity to truly say I had tried everything and that putting her down was the correct thing to do. When he returned on his next visit. He was calm; spoke soothingly (out of respect for my girl.) Made sure she was lying comfortably and gave us time to say goodbye. He was well prepared for every step of the procedure. The aftercare has also been fantastic. We received a beautiful card from him and the overall communication through texting has been very good. I am so glad that my girl got to spend her last minutes around people at home and with a doctor who cared.

> As our large breed dog entered his senior years we knew when the day came we wanted an at home euthanasia option. The day came where he could not get up on his own so we reached out to Dr. Gary. Dr. Gary was professional, patient, and considerate the entire way through. He discussed my dog's health with great care. He never once rushed any step of the process, allowing me to decide when I was ready for the next step. Letting our dog go was the most painful thing I have ever had to do, but with the aid of Dr. Gary I believe it was a gift to our sweet boy. He was home, in his bed, with his toys, cuddled up with mom.

I'm very grateful to Dr. Gary for his caring and gentle approach he provided my cat. Dr. Gary explained the process and answered my questions with heartfelt patience. He provided me the time and space I need to say my good byes. This experience was less stressful for both myself and my cat than having to go to a clinic. I will definitely use Dr. Gary's services again if and when needed in the future.

> I cannot thank Dr. Gary Hsia enough for the compassion and care he showed during one of the hardest days of my life. When it was time to say goodbye to my beloved Darla, Dr. Hsia provided an at-home experience that was gentle, peaceful, and dignified. He walked us through every step with patience and empathy, ensuring Darla was comfortable and surrounded by love in her final moments. The ability to say goodbye at home made such a difference—it felt calm, private, and full of care instead of clinical and rushed. Dr. Hsia’s professionalism and genuine kindness gave me comfort and peace during such a heartbreaking time. I am forever grateful for the way he handled this experience and would wholeheartedly recommend him to any pet parent seeking a compassionate option for end-of-life care.

The experience of being able to provide love and comfort for Rocky in his own home by utilizing this method made this already difficult experience of his passing, just a little bearable.

> We are incredibly grateful to Dr. Gary for helping our beloved cat, Lily, pass peacefully at home. Saying goodbye to a pet is never easy, but Dr. Gary made one of the most painful days of our lives feel gentler and more humane. From the moment he arrived, he treated Lily-and our whole family — with such compassion, kindness, and respect. He spoke softly, moved gently, and explained every step of the process with clarity and care. It was clear that this is more than just a job to him; he genuinely cares about the animals and the people who love them. We were able to hold Lily in her favorite blanket, in her favorite spot surrounded by the people who loved her most. There was no rush, no clinical coldness — only warmth, empathy, and space to grieve. Dr. Gary helped us give our girl the peaceful, dignified goodbye she deserved, and for that, we will always be thankful. If you're facing this heartbreaking decision, I can't recommend him enough. He gave us the gift of peace in a moment of sorrow, and we are forever grateful. The Brand Family

> Dr Gary was so kind and gentle with our sweet Lola. From the moment he came to our front door, he made sure we knew he was there for as long as we needed him to be. Never in a hurry, Dr Gary allowed us to spend as much time as we needed to comfort our baby and love on her. The manner in which he delivered his care was professional and dignified. We definitely recommend home euthanasia, because although difficult for us to say our last goodbyes, Lola had us with her for her last breath. In her bed, in her home. We received emails and texts for a few days after from Codapet and that really helped us with the grieving process.
