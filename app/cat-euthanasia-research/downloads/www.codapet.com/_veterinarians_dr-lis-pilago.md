Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I knew as a little child that I wanted to be a Veterinarian. I have always loved all animals and felt God's presence when close to them. When the time came to put my sweet dog to sleep due to advanced age and struggles, I was able to provide him with the home end of life care that he needed, and I could see the difference in comfort and peace that my beloved pet (and also my family) experienced though the whole process so I understood how important this service can be in such a sensitive time of their lives than I decided that I wanted to help other families and pets with the same kind of help my pet once received.

> Thank you Dr. Lis! I didn’t expect to loose my dog Monte so soon, but there was so much comfort in knowing that when it was time to put him to sleep; he was at home, in bed, wearing his comfy pjs. The process wasn’t long for him, and Dr. Lis was very kind in the words she used to help me get through such a painful time. ❤️
