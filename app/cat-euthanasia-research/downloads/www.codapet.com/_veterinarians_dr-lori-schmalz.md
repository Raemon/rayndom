Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

Becoming a veterinarian was a natural choice for me given my upbringing in which nearly all activities revolved around our animals. I followed the passion that was instilled in me by my family. I performed my first at-home euthanasia in 2007. It was an amazing experience with an owner and pet I had been caring for in clinic. I'll never forget what a beautiful day it was as I watched the owner kiss each of her dog's feet as he fell asleep in his beloved yard. It opened my eyes to how euthanasia could be and should be. Since then I have strived to provide excellent service so my clients and patients have the best possible experience in such a difficult and tender time.

## What pet parents are saying

> As horrific as this experience is for everyone, I don’t think we would be in nearly as good of shape if it weren’t for Lori. She clearly isn’t doing this for the money, she realized that she can help people get through this experience and we are so thankful and glad to have chosen this option and had the fortune to have her help guide our sweet Cleo and us through this journey. Thank you Lori.

> Making the decision that my beautiful dog, my best friend and companion through good and bad, needed to be euthanized was one of the most difficult of my life. Finding CodaPet and particularly Dr Lori Schmalz for in-home euthanasia, was a relief for both me and my dog. Dr Lori is so compassionate, reassuring and sweet that Scooby's passing was gentle slide from pain and distress to calm comfort. I will recommend her to anyone facing this decision for their pet. CodaPet's online scheduling is simple and takes just a few minutes. I even had to change the appointment because in the middle of the night Scooby began to breathe shallowly and he became suddenly much worse. At 3am I was able to change my appointment to the first one available. Thank you so much Dr Lori.

> Dr. Schmalz was incredibly patient with us and the weather as we were trying to create a calm, relaxing environment outside for Apollo's last hours with us. She was very communicative and had a calm demeanor that even put our other anxious dog at ease. Dr. Schmalz explained everything from start to finish without creating any feelings of pressure or feeling rushed. She had all of the necessary materials to make the experience casual, yet respectful and professional. I am so glad she was the one to help our loved one cross over the rainbow bridge.

> Dr Lori was absolutely wonderful. She cared for me, my other pets and especially focused on taking gentle thorough care of my baby who had oral cancer and could no longer eat or drink. I will seek her out specifically if/when I have to make the super hard decision to let go in the best interest of my babies in the future. On such a terrible day, she was warm, comforting, and knowledgeable. You can tell she has a heart for animals passing with dignity comfort and peace.

> I highly recommend CodaPet to anyone who has to make that difficult decision to say goodbye to their fur baby. Dr. Lori was absolutely amazing. She was so kind, compassionate and patient. She made such a scary experience truly beautiful. I had my Doobie 15.5 years and when the end came the last thing I wanted was for him to be afraid. She made him so comfortable and peaceful in his own home and bed. I am so grateful I made the decision to contact CodaPet.

> Losing my buddy Bexley was the second hardest thing in my life (second to losing my brother, a close second). He meant so much to me. We've been through so much together! He was a Colorado born dog but had traveled with me from coast to coast (multiple times). I was super fortunate in that we were together almost 24/7 since COVID. When I had to go into the office, my boss let him come too. He made the office brighter. Clients loved it! I've worked from home the past three years making our close bond even closer. Dr. Schmalz was extremely kind, professional, efficient, thorough and COMPASSIONATE! She made sure any questions I had were answered. She treated him with so much respect and dignity. Even though he traveled thousands of miles in cars, he never liked riding in the car. I cannot imagine driving him to the vet for this process! How that would have made him feel. Because of Dr. Schmalz, he was able to be relaxed at home on his pile of favorite blankets! This meant the world to me; ensuring he could be as comfortable as possible. Thank you Dr. Schmalz!

> We were facing the agonizing experience pet owners face when our beloved Joey, a mixed breed rescue dog we had for over eight years. He was approximately 15 years old and his heart was giving out on him. I had searched in-home euthanasia on line and found CodaPet. Dr. Lori Schmalz came to our home to help us end Joey's suffering. Dr. Schmalz was calm, caring, and compassionate. She checked Joey's heart, and agreed with our vet that it was time to have Joey peacefully put to sleep. Dr Schmalz made this most difficult decision we make as pet parents as calming and peaceful as possible. We would highly recommend CodaPet, and Dr. Lori Schmalz to everyone who need to help their pet transition peacefully, not only for the pet but also for the loving "parents" of the the pet!

> Our beloved Bernese Mountain Dog's health had been steadily declining for weeks. When we came to the gut-wrenching realization that his quality of life and health were so poor that it wasn't fair to him to let him suffer, we knew we had to intervene. When our previous pup reached this point several years earlier, we took her to our vet to be euthanized. It was absolutely awful seeing her for the last time on a vet's sterile, stainless steel table. We didn't want a repeat of that, so we contacted Dr. Lori. Dr. Lori has a beautiful, calming demeanor and reassured us that we were making the right decision. She came to our home so our pup could die peacefully and comfortably, surrounded by family. Having him die at home made this awful experience manageable, and she eased his passing in the most humane way. Our last sight of our pup was seeing him lovingly bundled in soft blankets in the back of her vehicle. He deserved to die with dignity and Dr. Lori provided that. I can't recommend Dr. Lori enough for a pet's end-of-life care.

> We were so thankful that Dr. Schmalz was able to come to our home on a Sunday (the same day we contacted her) to provide an in-home pet euthanasia for our sweet, beloved cat who had started to suffer dramatically the night before. Although putting a pet down is always incredibly difficult to decide upon and go through, we were so grateful that Dr. Schmalz could do this in our home where our cat was most comfortable and at peace in his final moments, where we felt more able to grieve openly, and where our other pets could be close by and better process the loss. Having now been through pet euthanasia procedures in both clinical and at-home settings, I will always choose in-home pet euthanasia going forward. Dr. Schmalz was so kind, compassionate, and respectful and really made this process as peaceful as we could ask for. Thank you so much for this amazing service.

After researching home euthanasia services I decided on CodaPet. I was able to schedule the date and time on line which was simple but anything but easy. Dr Lori arrived at the appointed time and was very understanding and respectful. She answered all of our questions and honored all of our wishes.

She was so warm, caring, and understanding of what emotions our whole family was going through. She helped us as we were struggling with that question that I’m sure many people experience. Are we making the right decision and is it the right time? She gave us so much reassurance. She was also so loving towards our sweet Max, who didn’t understand what was going on. It felt like she had known him a long time. She was gentle and yet professional and helped him pass peacefully. She gave us all as much time as we needed afterwards and cared for him like he was her own dog. Can’t say enough of how appreciative we are towards Dr. Lori.

> Dr Lori made this such a peaceful experience and has so much respect for the process. I am so grateful that my sweet boy got to leave this world in the easiest way possible and felt no pain. She gave us as much time as we wanted and allowed our other pup to say goodbye and take as much time as she needed also. I am so grateful.

> Dr Lori was wonderful. Kind and caring during one of our saddest days. She listened and was patient. She made our sweet Ella's passing so sweet and pain free. She listened to all the stories of Queen Ella and seemed to agree that she was the most incredible dog to ever exist!! She is an incredible human and we are so glad we chose her.

> After over 16 wonderful years with my beloved shih tzu, Pumpkin, the time came to say goodbye. It was one of the hardest decisions I’ve ever had to make, and an incredibly emotional time. Dr. Lori and Codapet helped make this heartbreaking process as gentle and compassionate as possible. Dr. Lori was incredibly kind and supportive throughout, treating both Pumpkin and me with deep care and respect. She ensured Pumpkin’s passing was peaceful and comfortable, and for that, I am truly grateful. Even now, thinking about it brings tears to my eyes. Thank you, Dr. Lori, for your compassion and for helping my sweet girl leave this world with dignity. I’m still waiting to bring her home, but I know in my heart that this was the kindest way she could have gone. Your kindness and comfort meant the world to me. My baby is now at peace, and I can grieve knowing she was surrounded by love and gentleness in her final moments. That kind of peace is truly priceless. Thank you again.

> Dr. Lori came to our house yesterday to help us say goodbye to our kitty. She seemed to have all the time in the world for us. She had the skills to handle our feisty cat and stayed very calm and kind. She recommended that we let our dog come and see the cat before she took her away, so he would understand why she was gone. She asked my daughter, who is 17, if she wanted the cat on her lap for the last part, and my daughter was thankful for that. Thank you, Dr. Lori.

> We lost 2 of the best boys ever yesterday. They were together and at home when Lori came to ease them out of their suffering. She was so kind and thoughtful towards them and our family. What was a gut wrenching day was made substantially more tolerable by her kindness and professional care.
