# A Pet’s Final Days: Recognizing Signs of Natural Death and How to Offer Comfort

[Dr. Karen Whala](/experts/dr-karen-whala)

February 04, 2025

Recognizing the signs of a pet's natural death can be crucial for providing comfort in their final days. Changes in breathing, temperature, responsiveness, and behavior can indicate a pet is near passing. Offering pain relief, warmth, and a quiet space are essential for ensuring a peaceful transition.

Most of us wish for a peaceful, gentle end for our beloved pets, one where they pass quietly in their sleep. However, this Hollywood vision is rare; fewer than 20% of pets experience a peaceful, natural passing. Depending on their health, a pet’s natural death may not be as serene as we’d hope, making it important to know what to look for and how to offer comfort.

Below, we outline the signs that your pet may have only a few days left, along with ways you can help them find peace and relief during their final journey. If you observe two or three of these signs, your pet may be close to passing within a few days; if you see more than four, this likelihood increases significantly.

## **7 Signs Your Pet May Be Close to Passing within 3 days**

  1. **Changes in Breathing Patterns:** Your pet’s breathing may become irregular, alternating between shallow breaths, deep rapid breathing, or long pauses. You might hear a “rattling” sound due to fluid buildup in their lungs or throat, as they are no longer able to clear it on their own. Gasping or open-mouth breathing is common and can be distressing to witness.
  2. **Difficulty Breathing and Signs of Distress:** If your pet’s breathing appears labored, with gasping or heavy panting, they may be in distress. You might notice their eyes wide open, their neck extended, or that they prefer lying on their chest rather than their side. This often indicates a struggle and may signal an approaching end.
  3. **Changes in Temperature:** Paws and ears may feel cooler to the touch due to circulatory collapse or a drop in blood pressure. These changes may result from heart failure, blood loss, or internal bleeding, indicating a failing heart or loss of blood flow.
  4. **Profound Sleepiness and Minimal Responsiveness:** As they draw closer to the end, pets may become profoundly drowsy, unresponsive to familiar voices, or emotionally withdrawn. This deep fatigue often indicates that the body is shutting down.
  5. **Urinary and/or Bowel Incontinence:** While incontinence alone doesn’t indicate imminent passing, if a pet loses awareness or doesn’t try to avoid soiling themselves, this can signal a decline in bodily functions.
  6. **Seeking Isolation:** If your pet seeks out odd, secluded places—under a shrub, behind furniture, or in muddy spots—they may be looking for a quiet place to be alone. This behavior is common in many animals nearing the end of life.
  7. **Unusual Posture and Laying Preferences:** If your pet consistently lies on their chest, avoids lying on their side, or stretches out with their head and neck extended, it can be a sign of discomfort or respiratory distress. Stiffness in their front limbs or inability to find a comfortable position may also occur.



## **How to Comfort Your Pet in Their Final Moments**

It’s essential to understand that a natural passing is not always peaceful. If your pet struggles with breathing, this can create a sensation similar to suffocation, which is deeply distressing. If you observe difficulty breathing, it may be best to consider humane euthanasia to prevent unnecessary suffering.

If you decide to proceed with a natural death, here are ways to help ensure their comfort:

  1. **Pain Relief:** Speak to your vet about appropriate pain relief to minimize any discomfort even if you don’t believe your pet is in pain. Best to treat for possible pain than not treat and add to your pet’s discomfort during their last days. Pain relief can also include supportive care such as medications for nausea and vomiting or dizziness.
  2. **Support for Breathing:** If your pet cannot comfortably breathe, it is best to discuss humane euthanasia as an option to prevent further distress or feelings of suffocation.
  3. **Provide Warmth and Comfort:** Keep your pet warm with soft bedding and gentle support to help ease any physical discomfort. 
  4. **Lubricate Their Eyes:** If your pet isn’t blinking, gently lubricate their eyes with a vet-recommended solution to prevent dryness.
  5. **Cleanliness and Hygiene:** Gently wipe them down to keep them clean without adding to their discomfort. Avoid bathing, especially if they dislike it, and consider using a diaper or piddle pad to maintain cleanliness.
  6. **Minimize Movement:** Move your pet only when necessary for their comfort or if they need assistance. If they’re in pain, they’ll likely find the position most comfortable for them and their condition.
  7. **Respect Their Privacy and Need for Quiet:** If your pet seeks isolation, allow them to stay where they feel most at ease. Allowing them the quiet space they desire is a natural part of the dying process for many pets.
  8. **Consult Your Vet for Palliative Medications & Hospice guidance: **Medications for nausea, pain, or anxiety can make the process more comfortable. Consult your veterinarian about any palliative options.



## **A Final Note**

Deciding to let a pet pass naturally or seeking help through euthanasia is profoundly personal and difficult. Knowing the signs of an approaching end can help you make informed decisions with your pet’s comfort in mind. The greatest gift we can give them in these last moments is the gift of a painless and peaceful transition from life to death, either by easing their transition naturally or ensuring a compassionate end through euthanasia.
