Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I knew I always wanted to be a veterinarian since a young age. I grew up overseas and started volunteering at local shelters and clinics in Malaysia at 7 years old. I was drawn to the mystery and science of it all, as well as the intense bond to help animals do all kind. Growing up, my brother and I both got a puppy. Unfortunately his puppy wasn’t thriving and started to go downhill pretty quickly. We took him to the local vet and I was able to watch them put him to sleep. I was 10 years old at the time, and watching our puppy who was struggling to survive have a since of calm and peacefully pass away, was what drove me even more into this profession. I realized that it was the last true gift we could give a pet, no more suffering.

## What pet parents are saying

> Dr. Salerian was so very sweet and empathetic. She makes you feel like a friend visiting, listening, and not rushing things. I had to make the difficult decision to end the pain and suffering of my 2 year old sweetheart cat, Mac. I really feel it’s harder emotionally and mentally having to make the choice rather then your fur babies passing away on their own , but Dr. Meagan definitely put me at ease. I wish I could write more to convey my thoughts better but of course I’m crying over missing my beautiful boy. So, as a pet owner from everything from dogs, birds, pigs, etc. I have personally referred Codapet and Dr Meagan to 4 different veterinary clinics, friends, and family in Southeast Louisiana!

> Dr. Meghan provided compassionate and comforting care during a very difficult time. Her willingness to explain the process, accommodate our schedule, and give us the space and time we needed to say goodbye speaks volumes about her dedication to both animals and their owners. She made a sad day more tolerable and facilitated a peaceful passing for our boxer Lexi. Being able to say our goodbyes in the comfort of our home made a difference in such a challenging moment. I know our Lexi was more at ease being with her family in the home she’s known since coming home as a puppy. Should we ever find ourselves having to make the same tough decision, we would choose Dr. Meghan again & again for her exceptional care and support during such a sensitive time.

> Dr . Salerian was amazing with my beautiful Napoleon. She was so calm and soothing to Napoleon during this most difficult time for me and my family members. We were outside in the back yard where Napoleon loved to chase the squirrels and the ducks. Napoleon loved his back yard so the setting was perfect. Dr Salerian was just so calm with Napoleon and gave us plenty of time to say our goodbyes to my beautiful dog Napoleon. Thank you Dr . Salerian for everything that you did for my Napoleon. You are definitely the best at what you do. I will never forget how you took care of my baby. Love you. 🐾🐾🐾
