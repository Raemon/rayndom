About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

As a veterinarian, my most meaningful experiences are those of guiding families through the process of saying goodbye to a beloved pet. My role is to provide compassionate support that recognizes the unique needs of each family- whether it be an objective conversation regarding quality of life, helping parents guide children through pet loss, or simply providing reassurance that the right decision is being made. Having a trusted guide throughout this complex process is essential.

> As hard as something like this is to go through, it is at least reassuring that you have a partner who understands the pain and loss that is associated with saying goodbye to one of your closest friends.

> Our cat Ella, took a turn for the worst and went downhill quickly suffering from irritable bowel disease. Choosing in-home pet euthanasia was equal parts the worst decision we had to make and the best decision we could make for Ella. Dr. Bonnie Goldthwaite was able to come to our home the same day and provided so much comfort during an obviously distressing time. Ella was calm in my arms while the injections were done and we sat with her for some time afterwards. It's been nearly a week and while we're still sad that part of our family is gone, we're so grateful to Dr. Goldthwaite for helping us at such a difficult time.

> Dr. Bonnie Goldthwaite took care of my service dog, Armani with professionalism and tenderness. She did not hurry the process and was attentive and loving during the procedure. She carefully explained the procedure and made sure Armani was relaxed and not in pain. I will always be grateful for her kindness.

> It took two painful shots in our cat's leg before he would lie down and be still. He was very scared after the first one. Then it took two shots to administer the euthanasia drugs. The second one was in his heart. He didn't seem to feel it at the time, and Ms. Goldthwaite was reassuring and surprised by his resilience, but overall it was exactly the opposite of what I had hoped for. We didn't want him to be scared like he would have been at the vet. Instead, he was scared at home. It was very hard to take.

> I contacted CodaPet for in home pet euthanasia for my cat. My cat had lymphoma and though he had been doing well he suddenly 'crashed' overnight and was very much in distress. Dr. Bonnie Goldthwaite responded to my same-day request, and was professional, knowledgeable, kind, and caring through the whole process. My cat is/was very afraid of strangers, and Dr. Goldthwaite called ahead and we discussed how to best handle the situation; I appreciated this so much, and it worked out perfectly. This was the first time I've used an at-home vet service, and I will do so if the situation comes up again. I highly recommend Dr. Goldthwaite if you have the opportunity.

> I made a last-minute appointment when my 14-year-old cat 'crashed' due to cancer. He had been doing well, but in the space of a day just suddenly went downhill and was obviously in his last hours. My vet had recommended a couple in home pet euthanasia services, since my cat is very fearful of strangers and taking him to a vet or hospital would have been extremely traumatic. I contacted Codapet and was able to schedule Dr. Bonnie Goldthwaite for the same day. Dr. Goldthwaite called ahead to review the process, listened to all my concerns, and helped work out a plan to mitigate the stranger-fear. She was prompt, knowledgeable, and kind at a terrible time. She explained the process before we started, and kept me informed through every step. The icing on the cake was the sweet wicker basket and homemade blankets she wrapped my sweetheart in to take him away. I will definitely recommend this service, and Dr. Goldthwaite, to anyone who finds themselves in this situation. It's awful to go through, and having a goodhearted guide makes a huge difference.

> In home pet euthanasia for our kitty was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do, but it was also the kindest way for her. Dr. Bonnie helped make it bearable by her kindness, interest in our story that brought us to this point, and help with understanding cat behavior. This last part was especially helpful to me since processing our kitty's recent behavior with Dr. Bonnie helped solidify my sense that my kitty was suffering and needed help.
