# Dr. Karen Whala

Co-Founder, Codapet | Founder, Peaceful Passing

Dr. Karen Whala founded Peaceful Passing in 2018 after receiving advanced training in the ‘art’ of in-home euthanasia through the Companion Animal Euthanasia Training Academy and is certified Fear Free and has received AAHA Accredited End-of-Life Certification. Dr. Karen believes she has found her purpose and loves learning about how to offer a better experience for pets and pet owners as well as networking with veterinarians who also share a love of this growing field. She annually attends and volunteers at the International Association for Animal Hospice and Palliative Care (IAAHPC) conference which helps end-of-life veterinarians that are dedicated to advancing the field of end-of-life animal care. After experiencing the clear benefit as a veterinarian in offering in-home euthanasia to grateful pet owners Dr. Karen’s passion for helping veterinarians offer this service led her to co-found CodaPet – A Peaceful Passing At Home, in order to expand nationally. Dr. Karen graduated from the University of California, Davis with both her Bachelor of Science in Animal Science and Management degree in 1998 and her Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine degree in 2006. She began her career practicing veterinary medicine as an ambulatory mixed animal practitioner working with both large animals, small animals and small exotics. She later began working at a full service small animal AAHA certified clinic for 5 years alongside veterinary specialists such as dentists, surgeons and behaviorists. In 2012, after losing her beloved dog Skeeter unexpectedly, she left private practice and decided to work in public health as a USDA veterinarian. Dr. Karen also has a secondary professional interest in veterinary public health and has a Masters in Public Health from the University of Iowa School of Public Health and is Board Certified in Veterinary Preventive Medicine. In her spare time, she loves international travel, backpacking, volunteering at her local church and grocery shopping. After assisting thousands of families navigate the difficult decisions involving euthanasia, she feels blessed to have this opportunity to increase awareness of IHE as an option for pet owners as well as give this gift of economic empowerment, time flexibility and professional fulfillment to fellow veterinarians.
