## What pet parents are saying

> Our family highly recommends CodaPet's services and Dr. Wolfingbarger. Our senior dog, Larry, always got nervous going to the vet, so we were thankful for the in-home service, provided compassionately by Dr. Wolf. She explained each step and the experience was peaceful, delivered with care and dignity.

> Dr. Wolfingbarger was exceptionally competent and deeply empathetic. I knew she was the right choice when my other dog went up to her. He rarely trusts strangers. We believe he knew Alexandra was at our home to help our suffering female German Shepherd. I highly recommend this vet.

> Thank you Dr. Wolfingbarger for doing the work you do. It offered my pup Boo Boo peace and comfort at the end. She never really enjoyed going to the vet since walking/standing was tough, so being at home was best.

> It took me a few days to write this because the pain of having to make the hardest decision I have ever made has just been difficult to deal with but I know I did what was best for my sweet Bella. My cat, my love, my soulmate, was aging and her health was declining and even though I did all the things I could do to make her life easier, it just wasn't enough. It is something I knew I had to do and have put it off many times but when I made the decision, I chose Coda Pet to relieve her pain at home. I cannot say enough kind words about Dr. Wolfingbarger. She came to home and was respectful and kind and very empathetic to my situation. She watched me literally fall apart and she kept encouraging me and telling me my baby was no longer in pain and at peace. Even though my heart is still breaking, I would not have wanted to experience this any where else than in the comfort of my home, of mine and my Bella's home. Dr. Wolfingbarger is a true blessing and I am beyond thankful for her service and commitment to our fur babies. Choosing in home pet euthanasia was the best decision I could have made for me and my Bella.

> We are so grateful for the compassionate care we received during one of the hardest moments of our lives. Dr. Alexandra was calm, kind, and deeply respectful. She softly explained the procedure, gave us all the time we needed to say goodbye, and answered every question with patience and understanding. She listened to our stories, looked at our photos, and treated our Elvis with dignity and tenderness. We would highly recommend this service to anyone facing the difficult decision to say goodbye to a cherished pet

> Dr. Wolfingbarger was kind and thoughtful during her time in our home. She explained everything thoroughly, gave time when we needed it, and provided excellent care to our dog,Sky, in her last hour with us. We are grateful Sky got to be surrounded by those she loved the most in her final moments, in the comfort of her own home. She provided transportation for the cremation, which took a lot of stress off of us at such a difficult time. My family and I are so grateful for her support!

> We couldn’t have asked for a kinder, gentler human to walk us through the hardest moment. Dr Wolfingbarger was quiet and professional and does not take the weight of her job lightly. Thank you for taking such good care of us and our old lady.

> We could not have found a better veterinarian to end our German Shepherd’s suffering than Dr. Alexandra Wolfingbarger. There are some people who radiate compassion as well as competence. Dr. Wolfingbarger is one of those. I had prayed that my female shepherd could go peacefully and as gently as possible, without pain or fear. I believe that prayer was answered. Dr. Wolfingbarger is a fine veterinarian who does this very difficult and delicate work of ending an animal’s life with great skill, patience, and deep empathy. My other dog, who typically distrusts strangers, came over to Alexandra. I think he sensed that she had come to help. And she did. We watched our Kyra slip away peacefully. We are grateful.

> Dr. Alexandra Wolfingbarger was kind, caring, and just all around a warm presence to have during this difficult time. I'm glad we were able to send Boo off in a comfortable setting at home as she was always stressed with vet visits. Thank you Dr. Wolfingbarger for allowing a peaceful transition during a really difficult time in both Boo's life and mine.
