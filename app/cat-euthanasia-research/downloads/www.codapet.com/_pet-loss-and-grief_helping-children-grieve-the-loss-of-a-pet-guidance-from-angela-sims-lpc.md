Pet Loss

Losing a pet can be confusing and overwhelming for children. Licensed Professional Counselor Angela Sims, LPC, provides guidance for helping kids process grief through honest communication, age-appropriate support, and meaningful coping strategies. Families in Dallas can combine therapeutic support with compassionate pet care to navigate this difficult time.

Losing a beloved pet is one of the most challenging experiences a family can face. For children, this loss can feel confusing, overwhelming, and sometimes frightening—especially if it’s their first encounter with death. Pets often hold a unique place in a child’s life, serving as friends, companions, and sources of unconditional love. When a pet dies, children may struggle to understand what has happened and how to process their emotions.

Angela Sims, a Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC) in Dallas, Texas, works closely with families navigating grief. Drawing on her expertise in supporting children and adults through loss, she emphasizes the importance of open communication, emotional validation, and guided coping strategies to help children work through their grief in a healthy way.

## **Why Children Grieve Differently**

Grief is a natural response to loss, but children experience it differently than adults. They may express sadness, anger, guilt, or confusion in ways that are unexpected or inconsistent. Some children cry openly, while others withdraw or become irritable. Regression—such as changes in sleep, appetite, or previously mastered behaviors—is common.

Angela Sims notes that these expressions are normal and reflect the child’s developmental stage and emotional understanding. Recognizing these signs early allows parents and caregivers to respond with empathy, guidance, and reassurance.

## **The Role of Parents in Supporting Grieving Children**

Parents often face the challenge of managing their own grief while helping their child navigate theirs. Angela recommends taking a moment to reflect on your own feelings before discussing a pet’s death with children. Grounding techniques such as deep breathing, journaling, or talking with a supportive friend can help parents approach the conversation calmly and confidently.

Equally important is modeling healthy grief. Children look to adults for cues on how to respond to loss. Expressing your own emotions openly—saying things like, “I’m sad because I miss Buddy too”—teaches children that grief is natural and acceptable. Sharing feelings creates a safe space where children feel comfortable expressing their own emotions.

## **Age-Appropriate Approaches to Pet Loss**

Children’s understanding of death changes with age, and tailoring conversations to their developmental level is crucial.

### **Young Children (Toddlers to Age 5)**

Young children may engage in “magical thinking,” believing their thoughts or actions caused the pet’s death. This can lead to guilt or self-blame. Angela recommends using simple, honest language: “Bella died, which means her body stopped working. She doesn’t feel pain anymore.” Reassuring children that they are not responsible for the loss helps reduce anxiety and guilt. Repetition is normal; children may ask the same questions multiple times as they process the concept of death.

### **School-Aged Children (6–12)**

At this stage, children begin to understand that death is permanent but may still have worries about their own safety or the wellbeing of other family members. Engaging children in memorial activities—like creating artwork, compiling a photo album, or selecting a special keepsake—can help them express grief and feel involved. Angela emphasizes the importance of allowing children to share memories and express emotions in ways that are meaningful to them.

### **Teenagers (13–18)**

Teenagers usually grasp the concept of death intellectually, but emotions can remain intense and complex. They may isolate themselves or feel pressure to hide their grief. Angela encourages parents to respect a teen’s need for privacy while providing support, such as encouraging journaling, conversations with trusted friends, or continued participation in hobbies that bring joy. Keeping lines of communication open while respecting boundaries is key to fostering healthy coping.

## **Honest and Compassionate Communication**

Honesty is essential when discussing a pet’s death with children. Euphemisms like “went to sleep” can lead to confusion or fear. Clear statements like “Buddy died” provide understanding and prevent misconceptions. Children may ask questions about the pet returning, what death means, or even their own mortality. Answering consistently and compassionately, while reinforcing family values or beliefs, helps children navigate these questions safely.

Angela also highlights that maintaining routines can provide stability during chaotic emotions. Predictable schedules for school, bedtime, and daily activities give children a sense of security while they grieve.

## **Encouraging Healthy Coping Strategies**

Supporting children in developing healthy coping mechanisms is vital. Families can explore a range of activities that allow children to process grief in constructive ways:

  * Writing a goodbye letter to the pet
  * Creating a memory box with toys, collars, or photos
  * Lighting a candle or holding a small family memorial
  * Sharing favorite stories or memories aloud
  * Engaging in physical activities like walking, biking, or dancing
  * Journaling or writing stories about the pet’s life



These practices provide emotional release and teach children that grief can be expressed and honored in meaningful ways.

## **When to Seek Additional Support**

Grief is unique for every child, but sometimes additional help is necessary. Signs that professional support may be beneficial include prolonged sadness, sleep disturbances, social withdrawal, fixation on death, heightened anxiety, or thoughts of self-harm. In these cases, working with a counselor like Angela Sims can provide guidance, support, and tools for children and families to navigate grief safely.

Angela uses evidence-based approaches, including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), and EMDR, tailored to each child’s needs. Therapy can help children understand and manage their emotions, develop coping strategies, and maintain resilience.

## **Local Resources for Families in Dallas**

For families in Dallas, Codapet offers compassionate, in-home end-of-life care for pets. They provide at-home euthanasia, cremation, and keepsake services. This approach allows pets to pass peacefully in a familiar environment, and families can say goodbye on their own terms.

Angela emphasizes that having access to supportive services like Codapet helps families navigate both the emotional and practical aspects of pet loss. Combining therapeutic support with compassionate veterinary care ensures children receive consistent guidance and reassurance during this difficult time.

## **Honoring Memories and Building Resilience**

While the death of a pet is painful, it can also be an opportunity for families to strengthen bonds and teach important life lessons. Sharing stories, creating memorial spaces, or volunteering in the pet’s memory can help children understand that love and memory endure beyond death. Angela Sims encourages families to embrace rituals of remembrance that honor the pet and support healthy grieving.

By providing guidance, support, and opportunities for children to express grief, parents can help them develop resilience, empathy, and emotional intelligence. Though the journey is never easy, children who experience thoughtful support during loss often emerge with a deeper understanding of life, love, and compassion.

## **Conclusion**

The loss of a pet is a deeply emotional experience, especially for children encountering death for the first time. Angela Sims, LPC, in Dallas, TX, emphasizes the importance of honesty, compassion, and structured support. By modeling healthy grief, maintaining routines, encouraging meaningful coping strategies, and seeking professional help when needed, families can help children navigate this challenging time.

For Dallas families facing pet loss, combining professional counseling with compassionate veterinary care ensures children have the support they need to grieve, remember, and heal.
