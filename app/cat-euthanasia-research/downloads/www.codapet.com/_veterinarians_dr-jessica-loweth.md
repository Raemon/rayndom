Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I've known I wanted to be a veterinarian since I was only three years old, sadly after my own cat was hit by a car. I learned then that only a vet could have helped my kitty, which started a lifelong journey dedicated to saving animals, and a special passion for providing a peaceful passing surrounded by loved ones. Providing in-home euthanasia affords me the ability to share the greatest last gift we can give our pets in the comfort of their own surroundings; it is absolutely my greatest privilege as a veterinarian to support the pets and their families through this transition.

> Dr. Jessica was very patient with us and informative also while she got ready. Saydee was relaxed with her at home. She gave us time to love her, comfort her...then cry my eyes out . I'm still in a daze; so lost. Did the best for her-even at the end Waiting for her ashes to be returned, then Saydee Marie will be home again Thanks again Dr. Jessica for making it as painless as possible.

> Dr Loweth was wonderful. Our boys wanted to be there for Powder but were scared. Dr Loweth talked about what to expect and how Powder would respond. She was kind and respectful when the boys lost their composure. For Powder, he was able to slip away peacefully at home in one of his many favorite nap spots, for us we could ugly cry as long as we needed to without fear of judgement. It was a good experience. We will use her again when it is time for our other fur babies to go and be with Powder.

> I wish I was not writing this review but, with a broken heart, I am. I'm hopeful it helps other pet parents as they navigate the unbearable pain of making the decision to end their fur baby's suffering; last Friday that was me. I asked my vet about in-home euthanasia and they recommended CodaPet. I called and spoke with kindest young lady who was able to answer my questions and get us a same day appointment with Dr Loweth. Dr Loweth was knowledgeable, compassionate, patient, and understanding. As difficult as the situation was, it was definitely much better for us and our fur baby being at home and thanks to Dr Loweth; I would definitely recommend her to anyone.

> Dr Loweth was kind enough to come the day we asked her because our dog was suffering. She was so kind and walked us through the steps to provide the best possible experience possible. We are so grateful for this service. We were recommended by our vet as well as another friend in the AG world. We will certainly recommend this company and Dr Loweth to others.

> Jessica is such a compassionate, knowledgeable, professional and caring person. She informed and explained to me every step that would be performed in helping my beloved 15 year old dog “Chase” cross the rainbow bridge peacefully. As most of us pet owners eventually have to make in ending and letting go of our precious and loyal friends, Jessica gave me such comfort in accepting this dreaded decision. If and when you have to come to this decision I would highly recommend her in helping you through this painful time. God bless you Jessica!

> Dr. Loweth was wonderful. We had to put our 15 year-old girl down on Mother’s Day. It was very difficult but the experience was everything we could have asked for. Our dog was at home, surrounded by my husband and kids, lounging in the yard, eating quiche as she passed. Dr. Loweth was kind, compassionate, and very focused on our dog’s comfort. We would 100% recommend her.
