Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I was always drawn to animals as a kid. I was the kid at the birthday party in the corner petting the dog or cat. I loved all animals and tried to bring them all home. As an adult and veterinarian I love watching and helping to foster the human/animal bond. Seeing how bonded dogs and cats are to their owners is remarkable. I think being able to provide end of life care in a familiar environment where the pet is relaxed and surrounded by those that love them is one of the most kind and caring things we can do for our pets.

## What pet parents are saying

> Dr. Stewart could not have been more compassionate, professional, patient, kind, and gracious during the final moments of our sweet kitty, Callie’s, life. Dr. Stewart throughly explained the entire process and took the time to interact with us and give us time and space to grieve throughout. I’m grateful for her skill as a vet and her compassion as a person, and could not recommend her more highly to anyone having to make this difficult decision.

> Dr. Stewart truly put at at ease. She was extremely caring and spent the time to get to know us and our baby. She walked us through the process and it was a very peaceful experience. We debated on taking him to the vet's office but ultimately decided it was worth the expense to have him be comfortable and for us all to be in a peaceful place for his passing. I'm very happy we took the home route and would highly recommend Dr. Stewart! Thank you for what you do and for being so caring and compassionate!

> Our 15 year old beautiful kitty had been managing with cancer and tumors for 4 years with medication to keep it subdued, and when it entered her throat, we knew it was time. I sadly googled “in home euthanasia” late at night, and CodaPet had availability the next day. Dr Stewart was immediately communicative via text the next morning, expressing concerns in case I needed her earlier. Dr Stewart was like an old friend, understanding and warm and when it was over, she hugged me and my husband which I’ve never experienced and still tear up, thinking about it. When the sad time comes for our other aging kitties, she’s who we’ll be contacting. We are so lucky to have found her.

> Dr. Anna Stewart was extremely compassionate and understanding with the in-home pet euthanasia we unfortunately had to have for our Golden Retriever. I'm glad such a service exists to have the euthanasia done in home versus at a veterinarian clinic. If we are ever in the position to have to do this again, we will be contacting Dr. Stewart. We couldn't have asked for a more caring and compassionate veterinarian for this very sad and upsetting time for us.

> Dr Stewart was very kind and patient during her visit. She let us take our time to say goodbye and I cannot thank her enough for allowing us to slowly walk our Rusty boy across the rainbow bridge. I can tell she not only cares for animals at her practice site, but humans as well after my experience. Thank you
