Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

At 16, I started working at an animal rescue and quickly realized that my love of animals was truly a calling, but it wasn’t until later that year when I began as an assistant at the local veterinary practice that I knew where I needed to be. I never looked back! My goal is to make sure that every animal knows they are loved and cherished, and that is especially important in their twilight years. Every pet should have a warm lap, a sunny spot, and a comfortable setting in their final moments, surrounded by love and family, and I am so honored to be able to facilitate that in Hampton Roads.

## What pet parents are saying

> Dr Erin Struble was wonderful. She was very kind and treated our Apollo with respect and compassion. She was also very supportive to us during this difficult time, giving us the time we needed to say goodbye. Doing this at home was so much better than stressing him out by taking him to the vet and he seemed so much more comfortable in his favorite spot in our home. Our hearts are broken with his loss but at peace knowing we made the best decision for him. 💔🐾

> Probably one of the most painful decisions we had to make was to let our cat Mocha go and we wanted to do an at home procedure. Dr. Struble with CodaPet was very thoughtful and caring with every step of the procedure allowing us time to grieve while patiently answering all of our concerns. She showed sincere empathy for our loss and treated Mocha with the greatest respect and care. At the end while saying our goodbyes, she gave us both a big hug in knowing how she felt for our loss meant a great deal to me. She later followed up to see how we were coping, which I'm very grateful for. We will never truly be over this loss and little Mocha will always be in our hearts but it helps tremendously when you have a compassionate veterinarian like Dr. Struble to assist in relieving the suffering of dying pet.

> We were beyond blessed to have Dr. Erin Struble help our precious Mika transition peacefully across the rainbow bridge. I’ve had painful experiences in the past with saying goodbye to pets, and I was anxious about going through it again. Dr. Struble changed that for me. She walked us through every step with patience and clarity, making sure we understood and felt supported. She never rushed us, giving both Mika and us the time we needed. Most importantly, she ensured Mika felt no pain and left this world in the gentlest, most peaceful way imaginable. Dr. Struble’s kindness, compassion, and professionalism went beyond what I could have hoped for. She not only gave Mika dignity in her final moments but also helped heal some of the trauma I carried from previous goodbyes. That is a gift I’ll never forget. Mika crossed over so calmly, surrounded by love, and I can never thank Dr. Struble enough for the comfort she gave our family. She is truly an angel in this work, and I will recommend her to anyone who finds themselves facing this difficult time.

> Dr Struble was Elysian vet for over 10 years and when we found out her time with us was coming to an end I asked about home care and she stepped up and did it herself at home. She showed us compassion and grace while we said our goodbyes. She took so much care of Elysian remains. I’m forever grateful to her for giving my family those few precious moments to say goodbye.

We are grateful that she was there to assist Ginger and Snickers and she was there for us.

She truly cares For anyone that must go through this experience I would highly recommend Dr Struble

> It’s such a hard decision to make when your best friend has reached the point when he is suffering more than simply struggling. Dr. Struble is extremely compassionate and patient. She made sure my old boy was comfortable and that we could have the time we needed to say goodbye. She explained the process in a kind and quiet way, completely respectful of our feelings in such a solemn moment. Thank you, Dr Struble for helping us make sure Zeus had a peaceful journey over the rainbow bridge.

In fact she had to repeat saying things more than once since family members arrived at different times. She was also very patient and empathetic to our needs. She made letting go of our Shiver bearable. Thanks for your support thru this trying time.

> Dr Struble provides an invaluable service to both out pets and to us their parents. My elderly large dog was in pain from advanced old age and arthiritis. She was able to stay in her familiar home and routine, and passed away peacefully in her favorite place, with our little cat Jack faithfully at her side the entire time. Erin is a patient and compassionate doctor. She took her time and allowed the process to proceed at its natural pace and when I was ready. I have 3 other elderly pets and hope their journey allows them to have the same stress free, comforting transition when the time comes.

> I do not have appropriate words to express my gratitude and appreciation for Dr. Struble and this precious service. We had to make this impossible decision very quickly, and I am so thankful that Dr. Struble was able to get to us within just a few short hours of scheduling. I am so thankful we didn't have to watch our precious Frankie suffer any longer, and that we didn't have to take him from his safety and comfort to do this. Dr. Struble was so patient and compassionate. She explained everything so well and gave us all the time we needed. She offered help and she even filled the role of therapist for me as I was breaking down and doubting my decision. Dr. Struble and CodaPet made one of the worst moments of our lives a little bit more bearable and we will be forever grateful.

She seems truly passionate about her job and treated me and my Annabell with respect and dignity throughout the entire process. I will highly recommend her to anyone in the area going through this difficult decision. The fact that I could have it done at home, versus having to put my girl through all that extra stress, means the world to me. I'm awaiting to get bell bell back , but I'm confident that she's in good hands until I have her back in mine. Thank you, Dr Erin Struble. From the bottom of my heart

> Dr.Erin Struble was an amazing partner in this transition of life. She took the time to listen to all of our stories as we gave Little Dog an Oreo cupcake, just before drifting off to sleep. Dr.Struble was well paced, moved when we we ready, and paid us and Little Dog the highest of all respects for this passing. My sweet girl passed in my arms on her favorite bed from her living room with her family surrounding her. It was beautiful and fitting for my life long companion of 16 years. I wouldn't have had it any other way. My urn was so lovely as well; way nicer than the ones I have had in the past. Dr.Struble was amazing. I couldn't recommend CodaPet enough for at home euthanasia. Thank you 🌈🐾
