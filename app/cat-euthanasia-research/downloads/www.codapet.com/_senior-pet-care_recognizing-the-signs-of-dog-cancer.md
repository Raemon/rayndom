# Recognizing the Signs of Dog Cancer

[Dr. Karen Whala](/experts/dr-karen-whala)

June 20, 2024

Dog cancer involves uncontrolled cell growth, with common types including melanoma, lymphoma, and osteosarcoma. Watch for lumps, sores, weight changes, and behavioral shifts. Regular vet check-ups, a healthy lifestyle, and early detection are crucial. Treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Ensure comfort and manage pain with proper care and nutrition.

## **Understanding Dog Cancer**

Cancer in dogs is a disease characterized by the uncontrolled growth of cells which is similar to cancer in people. These rapidly dividing cells form masses or lumps known as tumors. Some tumors are benign, meaning they do not spread to other parts of the body and generally pose a less serious health threat. However, some tumors are malignant and can multiply quickly, spreading to various organs and causing serious health problems. At CodaPet, we understand that a cancer diagnosis can be overwhelming for pet owners. Our team is here to provide information, support, and compassionate end-of-life care if needed.

## **Common Types of Dog Cancer**

As a pet owner, grasping the nature of the cancer affecting your dog is a vital step in providing the care and support they need. Canine cancers vary widely, but let's discuss the most frequently encountered types, along with breeds that might be at higher risk, and the telling signs to watch out for.

**Melanoma** and **mast cell tumors** are among the most prevalent forms of skin cancer in dogs, often appearing as suspicious lumps or sores on the skin. **Lymphoma** , a cancer of the lymph nodes, commonly causes swelling in areas like the neck, behind the knees, or under the jaw. Likewise, **osteosarcoma** , primarily a bone cancer, can be more common in larger breeds such as Rottweilers, Scottish Deerhounds, and the aforementioned Dobermans and Great Danes, often presenting as lameness or swelling. **Hemangiosarcoma** , which affects blood vessels and the spleen, can be particularly aggressive and frequent in breeds like German Shepherds and Golden Retrievers.

The signs of these diseases can be subtle and easily overlooked. Besides the obvious growths and sores, symptoms such as lethargy, persistent cough, difficulty breathing, and changes in bowel habits can indicate the presence of cancer. CodaPet believes in the power of knowledge. Awareness of your dog's normal behavior and physical condition is paramount, as it can lead to early detection, which in turn can have a profound impact on treatment success.

## **General Statistics About Dog Cancer**

With over 50% of dogs over the age of 10 being diagnosed with some form of cancer, the prevalence of this disease in our canine companions is notably high. Certain breeds are more predisposed to cancer than others, and genetics can play a significant role in a dog's cancer risk. Additionally, lifestyle factors can influence the susceptibility to this condition, including but not limited to exposure to environmental toxins, a dog's diet, weight, and exercise habits. As veterinary care advances and dogs live longer lives, the incidence of diseases such as cancer naturally increases—making age a critical factor. The most affected age group is senior dogs, typically those above the age of seven, though it can vary by breed and size.

Cancer's spectrum in dogs is broad, encompassing various types which can affect nearly any tissue or organ. Understanding the risk factors, signs, and possible preventive measures is essential for dog owners.

## **Why Dogs Get Cancer**

The causes of cancer in dogs are multifaceted and can include genetic predispositions, environmental factors, and lifestyle habits. Certain breeds may be genetically predisposed to specific types of cancer. Environmental factors, such as exposure to secondhand smoke or certain chemicals, can also contribute to cancer risk. Diet and exercise play a crucial role in overall health and can impact a dog's risk of developing cancer.

## **Physical Changes in Your Dog**

Physical changes in your canine companion may be subtle and easy to overlook, but they could also be signs of a serious health issue such as cancer. It's essential to stay vigilant and aware of any alterations in your dog's appearance or behavior. Here's what to keep an eye out for:

  * **New lumps or bumps** : Not all lumps are cancerous, but any new growths should be checked by a vet.
  * **Persistent sores** : Sores that don't heal could be indicative of skin cancer and require immediate attention.
  * **Unexplained weight loss or gain** : This could signal a metabolic change often associated with cancer.
  * **Appetite changes** : A persistent increase or decrease in appetite can be a sign of various health issues, including cancer.
  * **Abnormal swelling** : Swelling in any part of the body can be a sign of cancer and should be evaluated.



To perform a physical examination at home, follow these steps:

  1. Start with a visual inspection of your dog, noting any new or unusual markings, sores, or bald patches.
  2. Then, gently run your hands over your dog's body, including behind the ears, under the limbs, and along the belly to feel for any lumps or swollen areas.
  3. Observe your dog's behavior for any signs of discomfort or pain during the examination.



While not every change will be a cause for alarm, if you do notice any of the above signs, schedule a visit with your veterinarian promptly. Early detection and professional evaluation can make a significant difference in your pet's prognosis.

## **Behavioral Changes in Your Dog**

When a dog is suffering from cancer, they may exhibit various behavioral changes that serve as indicators of their ailment. Typical behavioral transformations to be vigilant for include a decline in appetite, an increase in lethargy, unexpected displays of aggression, or alterations in their bathroom routines. Distinguishing between your dog's usual behavior and potential signs of illness is essential. By having a comprehensive understanding of your dog's typical behavior, you'll be more equipped to spot anything out of the ordinary.

For example, a dog that is typically full of energy but suddenly prefers to rest could be exhibiting a warning sign. Observing any abnormal behaviors in your furry companion should prompt a visit to the veterinarian.

## **Understanding When Symptoms are Serious**

Recognizing the seriousness of your dog's symptoms is a critical part of responsible pet ownership. While certain signs may seem minor, such as a small lump that grows slowly, there are others—such as rapid weight loss, persistent vomiting, or changes in behavior—that warrant immediate attention from your vet. The role of regular veterinary check-ups cannot be understated; they are key in the early detection of cancer and other health concerns.

If you find yourself worried that your dog may have cancer, take action by scheduling a consultation with your veterinarian. Early intervention can make a significant difference in your pet’s prognosis. At CodaPet, we provide a supportive environment, ensuring you have access to expert advice and empathetic care as you make decisions about your dog's health.

## **Common Symptoms of Different Types of Dog Cancer**

Cancer in dogs, just like in humans, can vary greatly depending on its type, location, and stage. Skin tumors, often a telltale sign of skin cancer, might appear as new lumps or bumps on the skin, while lymphoma could cause swelling of the lymph nodes which you might feel under your dog's jaw, in front of shoulders, or behind knees. An abdominal tumor, such as cancer of the spleen, might lead to a swollen belly, weight loss, or a sudden collapse if the tumor ruptures.

With the advancement of the disease, symptoms can become more pronounced and may include persistent coughing, difficulty breathing, vomiting, diarrhea, or noticeable weight loss. Different breeds may also have variances in symptoms due to their unique genetic makeups and tendencies towards specific cancers. We encourage early detection and treatment to offer your beloved pet the best quality of life.

## **The Cancer Diagnosis Process**

### When to Visit the Vet

Observing your dog for changes in behavior or physical appearance is key in identifying potential health issues. Being proactive with regular vet visits can lead to early detection of diseases like cancer, which may improve treatment outcomes.

#### Tip #1: Monitor Behavioral Changes

Watch for any shifts in your dog's energy levels, mood, or interactions. Changes can often be subtle, so paying close attention is important.

#### Tip #2: Look for Physical Differences

Keep an eye out for unexplained weight loss, lumps, bumps, or any new abnormalities on your dog's body. Early detection of these signs can be crucial.

#### Tip #3: Maintain Regular Vet Appointments

Even if your dog seems healthy, routine check-ups can catch issues before they become serious. Early detection is often key to successful treatment.

If you notice any worrisome signs, it's crucial to schedule a visit with your veterinarian. Should cancer be a concern, your vet will perform a detailed examination and may suggest diagnostic tests such as blood work, imaging, or biopsies.

### What to Expect During Your Vet Visit

When you visit the vet with concerns about your pet possibly having cancer, you can anticipate a thorough examination. Your vet will likely begin by asking detailed questions about your pet's health history and recent changes in behavior or health. Providing a clear and accurate medical history of your pet is vital, as it can significantly impact the diagnosis process.

The vet may suggest conducting a series of tests to confidently diagnose the presence of cancer. These tests could include blood work, imaging like x-rays or ultrasounds, or more invasive procedures such as biopsies.

### Understanding the Cancer Diagnostic Tests

When your beloved pet is undergoing testing for cancer, knowledge is your ally. Various tools and techniques are employed to paint a complete picture of your pet's health. Here are some common diagnostic tests used to detect cancer in dogs:

  * **Blood Tests** : These tests assess general health and can indicate the presence of cancer by revealing abnormal levels of certain cells or proteins.
  * **X-Rays** : Often the first imaging test performed, X-rays can show changes in the size or shape of organs and detect abnormal growths.
  * **Ultrasounds** : This imaging technique uses sound waves to create detailed pictures of the inside of the body, which can help localize tumors and guide biopsies.
  * **Biopsies** : By removing and examining a small sample of tissue, biopsies provide a definitive diagnosis, determining the type of cancer and its stage.



### Interpreting the Test Results

Once the diagnostic tests have been conducted, understanding the information they provide is the next crucial step. Your veterinarian will be integral in deciphering the test results and will guide you through what they mean for your pet's health. They will discuss any potential treatment options, offering recommendations tailored to your pet’s unique situation. In the event of a cancer diagnosis, further investigations may be necessary to establish the cancer's stage, which can directly impact the treatment plan. Consultations with oncology specialists might also be advised, and a course of action will need to be determined.

## **Treatment Options for Dog Cancer**

### Overview of Treatment Options

There are several treatment options available for dogs with cancer, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. The choice of treatment often depends on factors such as the type and stage of cancer, the overall health of the dog, and the potential side effects of the treatment. Your vet plays a key role in discussing these options, providing expert advice, and making recommendations based on your pet's individual situation. Your veterinary team will work closely with you to understand your concerns, discuss all available treatment options, and help you make the best decision for your pet's health and quality of life.

### Surgery: Pros and Cons

Surgery can be a viable treatment option for certain types of cancer in dogs, particularly when the cancer is localized and hasn't metastasized. Opting for surgery may provide significant benefits, such as the removal of the tumor and possibly a complete cure. This treatment path strives to extend the quality and duration of your beloved pet's life.

The potential benefits of surgical intervention include targeted removal of cancerous tissue, which may offer a straightforward solution for cancers that have not yet spread. Moreover, surgery sometimes results in a definitive cure, alleviating the concern of ongoing treatment.

However, as with any invasive procedure, there are inherent risks to consider. Surgical risks for dogs include complications arising from anesthesia, the possibility of post-operative infections, and the chance of recurrence. It's essential to weigh these factors against the potential benefits.

Recovery from surgery is a critical period that requires patience and attentive care. Your pet might need help with routine activities and adherence to a post-operative care plan to aid in a smooth and comfortable recovery.

Your veterinary team should involve you in the decision-making process and help you have a clear understanding of what to expect during and after the procedure to ensure that your pet's comfort and welfare remain paramount.

### Chemotherapy: Pros and Cons

Chemotherapy is often utilized in the battle against canine cancer, applying specially designed drugs to combat and eradicate cancer cells. This treatment can be particularly effective in reducing the size of tumors and decelerating the disease's advancement, potentially offering your dog an improved quality of life and possibly extending their time with you.

Yet, while chemotherapy holds this promise, it also carries the potential for side effects. It can induce nausea, trigger vomiting, and cause a general sense of lethargy, which are critical to observe and manage. In providing care for your dog during chemotherapy, it is essential to maintain open lines of communication with your vet to promptly address any arising issues.

### Radiation Therapy: Pros and Cons

Radiation therapy, which uses high-energy rays to destroy cancer cells, may be an option for some types of cancer in dogs. This treatment can be effective in shrinking tumors and relieving pain and other symptoms. The potential benefits of radiation therapy include improved quality of life and, in some cases, increased lifespan. However, like all treatments, radiation therapy also has potential risks and side effects, which can include skin irritation and fatigue. Caring for your dog during and after radiation therapy is crucial, and your vet will provide specific instructions based on your dog's condition.

## **Caring for a Dog with Cancer**

### Creating a Comfortable Environment

When your beloved dog is facing cancer, their comfort becomes a top priority. To create a nurturing atmosphere, consider setting up a serene nook where they can enjoy uninterrupted rest. Soft, supportive bedding will ease their body, while keeping food and water close at hand caters to their needs without causing undue strain.

Maintaining a sense of normalcy through a consistent routine is vital—it helps mitigate stress and provides your dog with a sense of security. Pay attention to subtle changes in your dog's behavior or mobility, adapting their living space to match their evolving needs. Elevated feeders, ramps, and gentle grooming are simple yet impactful modifications that support their quality of life.

### Managing Pain and Discomfort

Managing pain and discomfort is a crucial aspect of caring for a dog with cancer. Signs that your dog may be in pain include changes in behavior, decreased appetite, difficulty moving, and increased aggression or agitation. There are many medications and therapies available to help manage pain in dogs with cancer, including anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and complementary therapies like acupuncture. Your vet plays a crucial role in assessing your dog's pain and determining the most appropriate management strategies. At CodaPet, we are committed to ensuring your pet's comfort and well-being. We will work with you to develop a comprehensive pain management plan tailored to your pet's needs.

### Nutrition for Dogs with Cancer

Proper nutrition is crucial for dogs with cancer. A balanced, nutrient-rich diet can help support your dog's immune system and overall health. Dietary adjustments, such as increasing protein intake or adding certain supplements, may be beneficial for dogs with cancer.

However, it's important to note that changes in appetite or dietary needs are common in dogs with cancer, and managing these changes can be a challenge. Your vet can provide guidance on the best dietary strategies for your pet's specific condition.

### Mental Health: Keeping Your Dog Happy

Cancer can have a significant impact on a dog's mental health. Like people, dogs with cancer may experience changes in mood, increased anxiety, or signs of depression. It's important to make an effort to enhance your dog's mood and mental well-being during this challenging time. This can involve maintaining a regular routine, providing plenty of mental stimulation through play and enrichment activities, and spending quality time with your pet. Regular exercise, when possible, can also contribute to improved mood and overall mental health.

## **Dog Cancer Prevention and Early Cancer Detection**

### Regular Vet Check-ups

Regular vet check-ups are a crucial part of early cancer detection in dogs. During a routine check-up, your vet will perform a thorough physical examination, which may include feeling your dog's body for any lumps or abnormalities, checking their coat and skin condition, and examining their eyes, ears, and mouth. Your vet may also perform blood tests or other diagnostic tests. Generally, dogs should have a vet check-up at least once a year, but more frequent visits may be recommended for older dogs or dogs with health conditions.

### Healthy Lifestyle and Diet

A healthy lifestyle and diet can play a role in preventing cancer in dogs. This includes providing a balanced, nutrient-rich diet and ensuring your pet gets regular exercise. Maintaining a healthy weight is also crucial, as obesity can increase the risk of certain types of cancer. It's important to avoid feeding your dog processed foods or foods high in sugar and fat. Instead, focus on providing a diet rich in lean proteins, whole grains, and fresh fruits and vegetables. Regular exercise, such as daily walks or play sessions, can help keep your pet fit and healthy.

### Awareness of Your Dog’s Normal Behavior

Understanding your dog's normal behavior is an essential part of early cancer detection. Changes in behavior can often be an early sign of illness, including cancer. This could include changes in appetite, activity level, bathroom habits, or mood. Regularly observing your dog and noting any changes in their behavior can help you detect potential health issues early. If you notice any significant changes in your dog's behavior, it's important to consult your vet who can help support you in monitoring your pet's health and behavior, providing resources and advice to help you ensure your pet's well-being.

### Early Cancer Detection Techniques

You are your pet’s best early cancer detection technique which is crucial for improving treatment outcomes and prognosis. At home, pet owners play a pivotal role in monitoring their dogs through regular examinations. This involves attentively palpating the dog's body for any new or unusual lumps and observing for changes in coat condition or behavior that could indicate a health concern.

Secondarily is your veterinarian and regular veterinarian check-ups are equally essential in early cancer detection efforts. These appointments allow for comprehensive evaluations, leveraging clinical expertise and advanced diagnostic tools that may include blood tests, X-rays, or ultrasound to uncover signs of cancer at a stage where it's often more treatable.

The dual importance of home monitoring and professional veterinary care, can help you understand what to look for during home examinations and when to seek a vet's expertise. Together, we all can work towards early detection and intervention to ensure your furry companion maintains the best possible health.
