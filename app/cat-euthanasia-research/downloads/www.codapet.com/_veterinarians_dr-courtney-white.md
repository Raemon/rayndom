Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

My father instilled in me his love of animals from a young age. I was privileged to be able to allow my 15 year old Golden Retriever, Annie, a peaceful passing at home, in the spot she chose. I want to be able to provide that same peace and comfort for other beloved pets and their owners.

> Dr Courtney White was sweet and helpful and caring. She explained everything and took the time we needed. It was such a blessing to have her in this difficult time and having an at home visit was truly a relief as I just could not take my cat out of the home never to return.

> I truly believe people are placed in your life for a reason. This time, we were given an angel to help us through one of the most difficult moments—letting go of our girl Chi after 15 wonderful years. The entire process exceeded our expectations. Dr. Courtney was incredibly compassionate and caring, and helped us say goodbye with peace, love and dignity. Dr. Courtney we thank you !!!🐾

> Dr. White came over on the weekend and quite at the last minute when our sweet Clementine went downhill very suddenly and our regular vet was closed. Dr White was incredibly respectful and so, so caring as she helped our girl cross the rainbow bridge. Dr. White and Coda Pet made a horrible situation bearable and will forever be grateful for the care she gave to us and to our wonderful Clementine.

> Dr. Courtney White came out to our office on a Monday evening to put our precious shop cat down. We all loved our Mayer but he was 14 and had recently had surgery to repair a broken hip and just wasn't recovering well from the surgery. We didn't want him to suffer and new it was time to say goodbye. Dr. White was so kind and caring and made the whole process so much easier on Mayer and on us. We highly recommend using Dr. White and CodaPet if you find yourself in a situation where you need to say goodbye to your beloved pet. It was so wonderful to allow our special guy to pass in the place he is comfortable, without having to go for a scary ride in the car, and for his people to be able to surround him in those final moments in our comfortable place, too. Thank you so much, Dr. White! -Kristy & Payton, A&H

> Dr. White was so kind and gentle with our 11 year old English Mastiff. Our dog was scared and disliked the vet offices. We loved our dog so much but it was time due to multiple safety issues with her heart condition and her collapsing. The Doctor made it peaceful. My dog was comfortable with her. The 3 step process made it painless. Our whole family was there to support and say goodbye. We thank CodaPet and Dr. White very much. We are sad to see her go but we know we did the right thing.

> Highly recommend!! Courtney was compassionate, and spent a lot of time on the floor with my wife and I holding and petting our dog. She explained the whole process, and how everything was going to go. I will definitely use her in the future if she’s still in business. Thanks again Courtney for making such a difficult time/decision for us that much easier. I’m glad to see Bella crossed the rainbow bridge while in the comfort of her own dog bed, in front of the lit fireplace. She was extremely content and under zero stress. I wouldn’t have done it any other way.

> Codapet was exactly what we needed for our dog Buddy. I got references from my vet and checked them all out, but Codapet was what we decided with. I have not had in home euthanasia so I felt I was going in blind. Codapet had a very easy website to navigate, (because I couldn’t talk to anyone without crying) and I eventually spoke with a customer service rep after scheduling, and they were very understanding and patient. Then, the local doctor, Dr. White made sure to contact me beforehand and ask any questions about the appointment. Then, she was very informative and patient with us during the appointment. We were not rushed, and everything was at our pace as we said goodbye to our very good boy. She talked us through every step. Dr. White is a compassionate medical professional and truly understands what we were going through. I can’t recommend her enough, she’s absolutely amazing!

> Dr. White made it possible for us to say goodbye to our baby boy Radar where he was happiest, in his own backyard. The sun was shining on him as he gently moved on to wait for us. Saying goodbye has been more difficult than we ever imagined, but because of Dr. White’s compassionate care we remember only peace and love, up until the very end.

> Chloe was the perfect dog (for me). To lose her is heartbreaking. Without ever meeting Dr Courtney White, I felt an immediate connection. She was very intuitive, helping us navigate a very personal and difficult decision. Chloe had become extremely anxious and confused lately, my biggest concern was that she not experience more of that. Dr. Courtney saw to it! My sweet little dag died very peas fully in my arms.

> Coming to terms with the end of your pet's life can bring lots of emotions and distress. Dr. Courtney White was an incredibly calming presence and walked us through step by step how the procedure would go, what to expect and allowed us to ask questions. She was also super patient and respectful while we were saying our last goodbyes to my dog Petey. She allowed us space and time to mourn before and after and took great care of my dog in transport. She left us with a healing stone as well which was quite a touching gesture. She was very professional, had clear communications, and offered lots of flexible options for receiving my dog's ashes back. I cannot thank her enough for giving me the ability to say goodbye to my life long pet in the comfort of our home.

> When we knew it was time to say goodbye to our beloved Stella, we wanted her final moments to be filled with love, comfort, and peace. Thanks to CodaPet and Dr. Courtney White, we were able to give her exactly that. On a beautiful summer evening in our backyard, surrounded by our entire family, we said goodbye to Stella. Dr. White arrived with a calming presence and gently walked us through each step of the process. Her kindness and professionalism were deeply comforting during such a painful time. Though our hearts were breaking, Stella’s passing was peaceful and serene; accompanied by the sounds of our voices, birds singing, and neighbors kids playing nearby. After Stella passed, Dr. White gave us as much time as we needed with her, and when we were ready, she gently took our girl into her care. A few days later, Dr. White personally returned Stella’s ashes to our home, bringing a sense of closure and deep gratitude. We are forever thankful for Dr. White’s compassion, calm demeanor, and the respectful way she guided us through one of the hardest moments of our lives. Saying goodbye is never easy, but with Dr. White, Stella’s passing was as beautiful as her life.

> This was the most peaceful experience we could have asked for both for our pup and our family. Dr. White was WONDERFUL. She ensured our pup was comfortable and not afraid. She gave our family all the time we needed to get ready and to say goodbye. She explained the process to us and answered all of our questions to help us cope with our decision and she was so incredibly compassionate before and after. She even hand delivered our pups ashes to our home for us afterwards. She made this very difficult process peaceful and put us at ease. We are truly, truly grateful ❤️
