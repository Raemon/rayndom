Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

Growing up as early as about 13 years old I loved animals and wanted to work with them to some capacity as part of my career. Once starting college I obtained a job as a veterinary technician assistant and the rest is history. I never saw myself offering In Home Euthanasia as a career within this profession, although a big part of my job on a day to day basis is performing this procedure. It was only after being able to perform this on my own pet in my own home that I was awakened with the huge difference it made and the comfort it offered both myself, my family and my passing pet. After experiencing this I wanted to ensure others in my area had an option like this as this service is not offered in the area I live. I am happy to do so and look forward to allowing other pet parents to benefit from the service.

> Dr. Williams is an amazing and compassionate care provider. Although I don’t want to have to use this service again in the future, as a senior pet owner I know the inevitable will happen and I will definitely request Dr. Williams again. Thank you for taking such good care of me and my family during such a sad time.

> KOA had lived nearly 17 years and had started declining. We had a scheduled time to for an in-home service to let him pass peacefully at home. Koa took a turn for the worst near 11pm days before our scheduled appointment. I text the number provided hoping by morning I might speak to someone. DR Josh Williams replied back within seconds letting us know he could come now. It was the best experience , it was calm and peaceful. We are so very pleased.

> Nothing prepares you for the loss of a pet. When the time came we were very sad and we felt the weight of what was to come. I wasn’t quite prepared for Josh or anyone for that matter to come in with higher energy than what we were feeling. He continued to speak and inform us of what to expect & his tone and manner reassured and comforted us. He told us she wasn’t going to feel any pain. He could tell how much we loved her. (This was her health status: This was the fourth time that she had become too weak to walk on her own and she had stopped eating solid food & stopped drinking water). If I had to do it again, I would choose Josh. He was respectful of her little body which meant everything to me. He made a very painful decision bearable. He’s a very sweet man. I’m very grateful for him and people like him that make a difficult process easier. Thank you for being positive in such a hard time. Thank you, Josh, for your positive attitude and your love for animals.

> Dr. Williams is kind and amazing. It was an honor to have him help our dog make it to the rainbow bridge. He was patient, kind, kept us informed of what exactly was happening, and gave us room to be with our dog exactly as we needed to be with him. We never felt rushed. I honestly can't say enough about Dr. Williams. He is in my phone forevermore because he will be the one sending any further family members home, rather than taking them someplace where they're afraid. Dude got to die surrounded by love, and to that I cannot thank Dr. Williams enough.

> Dr. Josh is a blessing to anyone that faces the very difficult decision to let their pet go. Home euthanasia was the perfect option for my girl Maddie. She was extremely fearful of strangers and Dr. Josh was sensitive to that and gave me the option to give Maddie her sleeping medication before he came into the home as not to cause her any stress. Dr. Josh was supportive and empathetic allowing Maddie and I to spend our goodbye time in a loving and caring environment. Dr. Josh was a gift I will always cherish and an important part of Maddies life story. When it is time, and you are considering home euthanasia, please don't hesitate with your decision to invite Dr. Josh into your home to assist in your goodbye journey. I shall remain forever grateful.

With his help, a completely soul crushing and heart breaking decision was made just a little more manageable. I highly recommend utilizing this service when you feel that your furry loved one’s time to cross the rainbow bridge is coming close.

> I'd be pretty hard-pressed to say what hasn't already been said about Dr. Josh Williams' compassionate and professional care. I do, though, want to echo those words with the greatest amount of respect and appreciation. Every bit of it is true. In the early afternoon light of a sun-filled day, my sweet boy Max was put to rest in our backyard. One of his favorite places to be. There was so much grace in those moments. No drama, no struggle . . . just peace. I am forever grateful ~

> My experience was a mixed bag of emotions. My Labrador Kiwi was the most amazing, loyal, intelligent, affectionate, playful, beautiful chocolate puppy. She took pieces of my heart and soul with her and I will forever miss her. I am grateful to have had an option to assist her transition in such a peaceful way. She was able to be out on the lawn on her favorite bed, surrounded by her favorite toys, eating bacon with the sun in her face. Love you, miss you Kiwi❤️

> I only did a consult with Dr. Josh Williams. As of today, my pet is still alive so somehow your paperwork hasn't caught up. I will be calling Dr. Josh, when the time comes to euthanize her. But my review of my consult is that, Dr. Josh, is an excellent vet. He's very caring, professional, and was wonderful with my dog. He has the perfect personality for this job that he does. I wish all vets were like him. I thought I wanted a female, home-visit vet, as my dog likes females better than males, but Dr. Josh, proved me wrong. He was so gentle with my little rescue dog, Bella. I have already recommended him to a couple of my friends.

> Dr. Williams is truly an angel on earth. During one of the hardest moments of our lives, he helped us say goodbye to our beloved Koffy.with a level of compassion and kindness that is impossible to put into words. He took the time to explain the entire process gently and clearly, making sure we understood every step and felt supported throughout. His empathy, patience, and compassion were extraordinary. From the moment he arrived, he treated Koffy with so much love, tenderness, and respect, as if she were his own. In such a painful moment, Dr. Williams brought us comfort and peace. His professionalism, warmth, and genuine care made an unbearable situation a little easier to endure. We will be forever grateful to him for giving our sweet girl a peaceful and dignified goodbye. Thank you, Dr. Williams, from the bottom of our hearts. We will never forget your kindness.

> My heart is filled with gratitude for this service. Everyone I spoke with was so kind and Dr. Josh Williams went above and beyond in his willingness to communicate with respect and clear genuine love for animals and their people. Few jobs could rival the emotional challenge of that where one steps in to help create a safe and peaceful end of life and I am so grateful to Josh for being capable and willing to do so. My dog, Shelby, passed peacefully in my arms at home. Josh was both professional and engaged with our experience. He held space for our grieving process and his work was done with so much compassion for Shelby and for us. I think it was easier for the other dogs so they could be a part of the grieving process rather than confused about why their friend left and didn’t come back. The gift of keeping Shelby comfortable at home to help her transition is one that will forever be in my heart and I am eternally grateful. Thank you so very much, Dr. Williams and your team. 🙏🏽

> I was initially hesitant to go with a national company that provides in-home pet euthanasia because I feared the experience would be impersonal. Our experience was anything but that. Dr. Josh Williams was so incredibly caring and compassionate. He helped us understand Leilah’s condition and provided information that helped us in making this difficult decision. He was kind, gentle and patient with my husband and me as we deliberated, and he was equally gentle with our girl Leilah, who left us quietly and peacefully in our arms. Our other dog was able to witness Leilah’s departure, which was much better than Leilah simply disappearing from our home to the vet. Losing Leilah has been hard but I can’t think of a better way to ease her passage. I hope we’ll have our other dog for many more years, but when the time comes, I will definitely be reaching out to Josh again

> Saying goodbye to a beloved fur baby is one of the hardest things we can go through, and losing Papa Chico felt like losing a piece of my heart. He was more than just a dog—he was family. When it was time to help him cross over the rainbow bridge, I knew I wanted his final moments to be peaceful, comfortable, and filled with love. Dr. Josh provided exactly that and more. His compassion, professionalism, and gentle presence brought such comfort during one of the most emotional days of my life. He treated Papa Chico with the utmost respect and tenderness, allowing him to pass in the familiarity of his own home, surrounded by love. I couldn’t have asked for a better experience under such difficult circumstances. Dr. Josh’s calm energy and empathy made all the difference. I will forever be grateful for how beautifully he helped guide Papa Chico’s final moments. Thank you, Dr. Josh, for helping my sweet boy transition peacefully. Your work is a gift.

> I had been dreading the day I’d have to say goodbye to my sweet girl for a while, between being worried that a vet wouldn’t believe me when I said she was ready and just knowing what the rushed process of having this done in a vet clinic is like. I could not be more grateful to have found Dr. Josh. He was a huge answer to prayer. As others have said, he is very gentle and kind and doesn’t bring an inappropriately high energy to the situation. He let us take our time, he throughly walked us through everything that would happen, and most importantly to me, he reassured us that we were making the right decision for our girl. He even got down on the floor to talk to my grieving toddler and explain that our girl was ready and answered his questions. Losing my girl was so incredibly painful, but Dr. Josh provided us with the best experience we could have had. We got to be in her favorite room in the house by an open window so she could breathe the warm, fresh air while lying on her softest bed in my arms as she fell asleep. No rush, no noise of other pets/people around us, and no having to walk to a front desk afterward to pay the bill while barely holding it together. Dr. Josh’s care for every pet he meets is obvious, and I would highly recommend him and his services to anybody who is needing to help their beloved fur babies cross over to the rainbow bridge!

> I really appreciated Josh’s sensitivity, professionalism, and overall kindness in assisting with my dog, Zilly’s at home euthanasia. As my long time companion rested in the grass, we loved her with our words, petting, and compassion. As time passed she peacefully passed away. Josh never rushed us and encus to take our time. He helped us carry her and place her in the grave in the garden. He helped my dog, Zilly, and me through a very difficult transition. This has really helped me to move through the grieving process in a healthy way. I have so much peace of mind that Zilly was able to die in a respectful, peaceful, and loving way . It was my last gift to her. I so appreciate Josh and his ability to provide support for me and my dog at a time that I felt at a loss and out of sorts.
