For Dr. Angela Schmillen, offering in-home pet euthanasia is all about honoring the special bond between families and their furry friends in the most compassionate way possible. After nearly two decades serving as an Army veterinarian, Dr. Schmillen now brings her calm demeanor and deep empathy to help pets in the Richmond area pass peacefully at home, surrounded by love and comfort.

Her path to this meaningful work is influenced by both personal experiences and her professional background. From caring for military working dogs around the world to saying farewell to her own pets, Dr. Schmillen truly understands the importance of providing comfort and familiarity during those tough goodbyes.

## **A Lifelong Commitment to Supporting Military Animals and Their Families**

Growing up in Florida, Dr. Schmillen realized early on that veterinary medicine was her true calling. Her love for animal care led her to the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine, where she earned her DVM in 2005. She then joined the U.S. Army Veterinary Corps, dedicating the next 19 years to caring for military animals, supporting service members and their pets, and working in food safety and public health. Along the way, she also earned a Master of Public Health and became board-certified by the American College of Veterinary Preventive Medicine (ACVPM).

Yet, no matter how far her career took her—from military bases to public health initiatives—her passion for hands-on care never faded. Now, as she nears retirement from military service, Dr. Schmillen is returning to her roots in direct animal care, this time focusing on providing end-of-life services for cherished companion animals.

## **A Personal Perspective on Peaceful Endings**

“Deciding to euthanize a cherished pet is never a simple choice,” shares Dr. Schmillen. “Yet, it’s often one of the most compassionate decisions we can make for them.” She’s been through this journey both in a clinical environment and in the warmth of her own home with her pets, and the contrast was striking.

“The kindness and support from veterinarians in both scenarios has always been remarkable, but I found that being at home offered a sense of comfort and familiarity for both myself and my pets that just can’t be matched elsewhere,” she explains. “I feel privileged to provide a similar experience for other families, helping to ensure their pets’ transition from this life is as peaceful as possible.”

Driven by a desire to offer this compassionate choice to others, Dr. Schmillen sought advanced training through the Companion Animal Euthanasia Training Academy (CAETA), earning her title as a Certified Peaceful Euthanasia Veterinarian (CPEV). Now, she serves families throughout Richmond, Chesterfield, Mechanicsville, Midlothian, Glen Allen, and the surrounding areas.
