## What pet parents are saying

> Dr. Loughmiller made the trip to us on the same day we made our request for in home services. She explained everything that she was going to do and what to expect. She was gentle, understanding, and kind during our grieving process. Thank you so much for easing our beloved Dexter's passing, at home, and surrounded by those that loved him.

> Dr. Loughmiller was very accommodating to meet our needs at the last minute for our beloved Titan. She kept in touch with her arrival time and was extremely understanding and very kind upon arriving so late at night. Saying goodbye to your pet is the most difficult thing to do but the level of care never wavered. From her gentle approach to the dignified and formal way that Titan was carried out of the house - placed gently on a stretcher with a sheet laid upon him so delicately - will always be a comforting way to remember making the most difficult decision of my life and saying goodbye to my best friend.

> Despite the difficult circumstances of having to say goodbye to our Lucy girl, we had a good experience of having Dr. Loughmiller come to our home to help with Lucy's passing. Dr. Loughmiller thoroughly explained the process of euthanasia and gave us all the time we needed to say our goodbyes prior to and post Lucy's passing. It was comforting to be able to have Lucy pass at home in a familiar, peaceful environment. We would recommend calling Dr. Loughmiller if you are looking for at home euthanasia services for you beloved pet.

> I highly recommend in home euthanasia or Dr Loughmiller highly enough, for someone who truly loves their pet and knows that death is coming in advance. Dr Loughmiller came over and was so loving and kind and gentle with my cat, and it made the whole situation so much easier to deal with mentally. It was very personal and easier, to just stay at home and have death meet us here, rather than load my cat in a crate and take him to my vet's office. My cat hates car rides and the vet's office, it gives him huge anxiety, as he's been doing it often for years because of his conditions. But he was so relaxed and peaceful with Dr Loughmiller at home. Which is exactly what he deserved. She is a lovely human and you could tell doing it made her emotional too, which I appreciated. Everything was scheduled and paid for online and she very politely left quickly and quietly right after so I could fully melt down in privacy. I can't reccomend her or this service enough. It made for a very very peaceful and loving end for my soulmate cat, Nemmy.

> Dr. Alexandra came out to our house to help us through a really tough decision we had to make which was to let our Lilly girl of 13 years go in peace. I can’t say enough about how grateful we are to have had Dr. Alexandra be the one who came out. She was so kind and explained everything and our Lilly girl didn’t feel anything she just went to sleep. A few weeks later I got a package in the mail from Dr. Alexandra and it had a poem called the rainbow bridge and a beautiful sun-catcher with Lillys name on it. She is a very caring person and we are so pleased she was there to help us through that difficult time.

> Dr. Alexandria was extremely prompt and on time. She was so kind and understanding, and gave us time to process each step. I was so thankful for her detailed explanation of the process so I knew my baby girl wouldn’t suffer. She was very gentle with Carmel and let her sniff her. I did not feel rushed during any part of the process! Overall I would do it all again in a heart beat. I will be using Dr. Loughmiller’s services in the future for my other geriatric dog. If you are needing this service do not hesitate! The care was amazing. The comfort for your pet to be able to pass in their own safe space was priceless.

> Putting a pet down is never any easy decision to make. Our 14 year old lab mix, Sam, had been on a steady decline since spring of 2024. We thought we were going to have to say goodbye in May, but with treatment of his symptoms he bounced back relatively well. However, Sam's mobility was becoming more and more limited, to the point that we would have to help him up from lying down. Sam had the unfortunate luck of contracting mange in his old age as well. After defeating the mites, it took a toll on him. My wife and I do not have children and our dogs are our kids. Sam is the youngest, but has had the roughest life. We decided the time had come for Sam to pass-on with what dignity he could. We were going to take him into the vet, but thought about the aftermath of us in a public place, getting Sam in a bag/box, then having to unwrap him at home. We opted to use an in home pet euthanasia. CodaPet was the recommended service by our Vet. We had prepared a bed outside (perfect weather), fed Sam some pizza, and loved on him until Dr. Loughmiller arrived right on time. Dr. Loughmiller was professional and concise. She answered any questions we had about the procedure and was timely the process. Her follow-up after the procedure was appreciated as well. She sent us a mailer that included a daangle decoration with a stamped metal dog paw, rainbow crystals, clear crystals, and Sam's name on a tag. Along with the Rainbow Bridge poem. It was appreciated and he hung the decoration about our kitchen sink. We will, unfortunately, be using CodaPet again in the not so distant future, since we have two other elderly dogs. Thanks for what you provide.

> When our dog Riley started to decline quickly, we knew we didn’t want him to be in pain for long. We knew that taking him to the vet would fill some of his last moments with fear and anxiety. We chose to have an in-home euthanasia that way he would be surrounded with familiarity and feel at ease the whole time. It was fast and painless for him, and for me and my husband. We were able to say goodbye and grieve in an easy way.

> As our dog’s age and dementia advanced and the inevitability of having to let her go set in, we struggled particularly with the thought of her life ending with the anxiety of the vet’s office. CodaPet and Dr. Loughmiller made it possible for us to say this difficult goodbye here in our home. Dr. Loughmiller provided our beloved 16-year old Schnoodle with a peaceful and gentle passing here in our home with us, lying in her favorite poofy bed by the fire. We are so grateful for the kind and compassionate care that Dr. Loughmiller provided, and how she honored our grief in this tender moment. Thank you for making this difficult goodbye as gentle and kind as it could possibly be, and for allowing us to show our love and gratitude to our sweet fluff girl in her final moments with us.
