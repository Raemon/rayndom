Pet Health

Degenerative Myelopathy is a progressive spinal cord disease that affects many older dogs, leading to weakness, loss of coordination, and eventually paralysis. While there’s no cure, supportive care, mobility aids, and compassionate planning can make a meaningful difference in your pet’s quality of life. Understanding the signs and knowing when to consider in-home euthanasia can help families make the most loving choices for their companions. 

## **Key Takeaways**

  * Degenerative Myelopathy (DM) is a progressive spinal cord disease in older dogs that causes weakness, loss of coordination, and eventually paralysis.
  * A mutation in the SOD-1 gene is the main cause, but other factors may contribute.
  * While there’s no cure, supportive care and mobility aids can help pets enjoy a good quality of life for longer.
  * Most dogs eventually lose mobility, so quality-of-life discussions and end-of-life planning are important.



## **What Is Degenerative Myelopathy?**

Degenerative Myelopathy, often shortened to DM, is a disease that slowly affects the spinal cord in older dogs. It usually begins with weakness in the back legs, causing dogs to stumble or struggle to get up. Over time, it progresses to the point where standing and walking become impossible. Sadly, in the later stages, incontinence is also common. While this condition is serious, early awareness and supportive care can make a difference in how long your dog remains comfortable.

## **What Causes Degenerative Myelopathy?**

The biggest factor behind DM is a mutation in the SOD-1 gene, which is responsible for protecting the body’s cells from damage. When this gene doesn’t function properly, harmful molecules known as free radicals build up and gradually damage the spinal cord. This damage doesn’t happen overnight—it develops slowly, often going unnoticed until symptoms begin to appear. While genetics are the primary driver, some veterinarians believe that outside influences such as environment or lifestyle may also play a role. In most cases, though, it comes down to whether a dog has inherited the mutation, which is why genetic testing can be such a valuable tool for families.

## **Recognizing the Symptoms**

The first signs of DM often show up in the back legs. A dog may drag a paw, lose balance easily, or have trouble rising from a lying position. As the disease advances, coordination worsens, muscles weaken, and incontinence may appear. Eventually, dogs lose the ability to walk altogether.

## **Breeds More Likely to Be Affected**

Although any dog can develop DM, it’s most often seen in older pets, typically around eight years of age or older. Breeds with a higher risk include German Shepherds, Boxers, Siberian Huskies, Chesapeake Bay Retrievers, Golden Retrievers, Bernese Mountain Dogs, Pembroke Welsh Corgis, Rhodesian Ridgebacks, and Standard Poodles.

## **How Veterinarians Diagnose DM**

There isn’t a single test that confirms DM. Instead, veterinarians use a combination of a dog’s breed, medical history, neurological exam, and imaging tests to rule out other conditions. X-rays, MRIs, or spinal fluid analysis may be used to exclude issues like disc disease, arthritis, or spinal tumors. Genetic testing adds another layer of insight by showing whether a dog carries one or two copies of the SOD-1 mutation, which can help assess their risk.

## **Treatment and Support**

Although there’s no cure, there are ways to support a dog living with DM. Managing other health problems, such as arthritis, can reduce pain and improve mobility. Physical therapy and hydrotherapy are especially valuable for slowing muscle loss and keeping a pet active longer. Many families also turn to practical tools—like slings, pet ramps, rugs for traction, or wheelchairs—to help their dogs stay mobile and continue enjoying daily life.

## **Quality of Life and Prognosis**

The progression of DM is difficult, and most dogs lose the ability to walk within a year of showing signs. Incontinence and full-time care needs often follow, which can be especially challenging for families with larger dogs. Because of this, quality-of-life conversations become very important. While saying goodbye is never easy, planning ahead ensures that a dog’s final months are filled with comfort, dignity, and love.

## **When to Consider In-Home Euthanasia**

As Degenerative Myelopathy advances, there often comes a time when mobility is gone, incontinence becomes unmanageable, and daily life feels more like a struggle than a joy. This is when many families begin to ask themselves one of the hardest questions: how do I know when it’s time to say goodbye? While every dog is different, veterinarians often recommend focusing on quality of life. If your pet can no longer enjoy the activities they once loved or cannot move without significant assistance, it may be time to consider humane options.

For many families, in-home euthanasia offers a peaceful alternative. Instead of a stressful trip to the clinic, a veterinarian can come to your home, where your pet feels most comfortable and safe. CodaPet helps connect families with compassionate veterinarians who specialize in at-home care, giving pets a chance to pass surrounded by familiar sights, sounds, and loved ones. This option can provide both pets and their people with comfort and closure during one of life’s most difficult moments.

## **Conclusion**

Degenerative Myelopathy is a journey no pet parent wishes to take, but awareness and preparation can make a meaningful difference. From managing symptoms with physical therapy and mobility aids to ensuring comfort with supportive care, there are ways to give your dog more good days. Still, it’s important to acknowledge the realities of the disease and plan for the future.

When mobility and independence are gone, in-home euthanasia can be a gentle and loving way to say goodbye. With the support of services like CodaPet, families don’t have to face this decision alone—they can turn to trusted professionals who bring compassion directly into the home. In the end, the greatest gift you can give a beloved companion is a life filled with love, followed by a peaceful passing when the time is right. By approaching DM with understanding and empathy, you can ensure your dog’s final chapter is written with dignity and care.
