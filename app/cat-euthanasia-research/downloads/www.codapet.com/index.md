> I can’t say enough good things about Dr Kristi Thompson’s kindness and compassion both before, during, and after this process. 10/10 would recommend. She thoroughly and professionally explained the process. She listened carefully to the long list of ailments our senior dog was experiencing. She then examined our dog and explained what was potentially treatable, and what the prognosis was. This allowed us the chance to make a fully informed decision before proceeding. I appreciated that, especially since it was a lethal one for a very loved family member. We never felt rushed or pressured one way or the other. I just wish there were people doctors who were as attentive, kind, compassionate, and laid out the various options to their patients.

A few weeks later we had to put our handsome Shrek down after learning he had a large mass on his spleen. It was very unexpected but Dr. Gonnering was so compassionate and made us feel better about our decision. We are so grateful to have had Dr. Gonnering during this difficult time.

> This was definitely the way to give your baby wings. My dog was very afraid of the vet office, and i did not want him to be on his last day on earth. Dr Anna was on time, very loving, caring and made us all feel at ease with going forward. She even brought a treat for him, and my very usually picky dog ate it! She was amazing, and I would definitely call on her again. Thank you, Dr Anna. The Hallfrisch's.

> Mac was my first pet- my kitty cat of 18 years. I consider myself very fortunate to have had him as a buddy for so long. So when he showed signs of his time being up, I knew from a friend -in home pet euthanasia- was a peaceful goodbye. Dr. John Murray was beyond thoughtful and professional with amazing bedside manner. Mac had a wonderful last day at home and I held him in my arms as we said goodbye. It was beyond hard, but I also wouldn’t have it any other way looking back. Mac hated his car carrier, the car, a vet office is so cold. We were in our beautiful, sunny room, comfortable and well, I’d want to go the same way! Thank you again for being so wonderful to our sweet baby.

> There are no words that fully capture the gratitude I feel for Dr. Daniela Lutri. During the most heartbreaking moment of my life, she showed up with an incredible amount of compassion, patience, and gentleness. She treated my sweet Harley with such dignity and respect, and she treated me with kindness when I was completely broken. Dr. Lutri took the time to explain everything, never rushed a single step, and made sure Harley was comfortable, peaceful, and surrounded by love. The calm presence she brought into my home made an unbearable situation feel just a little more humane and a little less terrifying. Saying goodbye to a soul dog is devastating, but knowing Harley passed quietly, pain-free, and in my arms is something I will forever be grateful for. Dr. Lutri gave us the gift of a peaceful goodbye, and that is something I will carry with me for the rest of my life. I cannot recommend her enough to anyone facing this impossible decision. She truly does this work from the heart.

> Dr. Katie was amazing! She handled everything so professionally yet personally too. Ruger will be so missed by many (as she can attest to, she said it was the biggest crowd she'd had, there were 9 of us) and I will never take my pets to a cold impersonal clinic to pass if I can help it. Having your pet pass at home where they're comfortable and familiar was such a blessing!

> When our French bulldog Roxen was diagnosed with Stage 5 IVDD and could no longer walk with in a matter of two days and was in extreme pain even with the meds our vet had given us to the point where I could not even move him without him yelping in agony, we had to make the difficult decision to put him down in a short time frame. It was not an easy decision and was even harder being over the weekend with our normal vet not being very helpful to us in our opinion. So after doing research and looking around at places that could do it, my mom told me of a friend of hers that had gotten an in home euthanasia. At the time I had never heard of it and I had never had to be the one to put a family pet down, so I looked around at a couple of different places on the internet after a google search. Most websites made it more difficult to schedule a time for a vet to come and visit, but with codapet.com it was actually very user friendly. So on Sunday morning after having a rough night with our beloved roxen, I set the initial appointment up for the first available for my area which was on Tuesday. Within moments I received emails and texts confirming the appointment. Dr. Schmillen reached out to me after reading our story of what had been happening to our boy Roxen and said that she could come sooner if we needed. At the time we were still thinking about going to an emergency vet place we had never been where we were going to have to move Roxen who yelped in pain whenever I tried to move him, so when she said she could come sooner I asked if she could come the same day and she said yes. She came within a few hours and was very respectful and understanding about what was going on and explained the whole process to our family. Her coming to the house on such short notice really shows how much she cares for pets and their families that have to go through this difficult time. She helped make this hard decision for us a little easier and words cannot express how grateful we are for her and the service they provide. Being able to be in your home and having your beloved pet be surrounded by all of their loved ones including our other dog Jax was a blessing. The whole process took a couple of hours and it was much easier for him to be laid to rest in his favorite bed surrounded by us instead of being on a cold table in a strange place with only a few of us being with him. I will suggest this process to everyone I know and I will only do it this way if I ever have to do it again (although I am hoping I never have to again). Dr. Angela was very kind to the whole family and took her time. She helped us and our young daughter (12) understand everything that was going on and made the whole process a little easier. I cannot say enough how grateful we are for her and the service they provide.

> Dr Sarah was incredibly compassionate and tender with our 20+ year old cat, Meadow. This was our second time with at-home pet euthanasia. The experience was very peaceful for Meadow; she was home and on her favorite couch blanket in her final moments, surrounded by love and care. Dr Sarah took the time to ask about Meadow's story, how long we had her, and really connect with us before helping us say goodbye. We'll call CodaPet when our next senior is ready to cross the rainbow bridge.

> It's the service you never want but when it comes I was so thankful for Dr. Todd. She was so compassionate and patient with us. Our sweet cat was able to cross the rainbow bridge in the comfort of his home without the stress of being moved to a vets office in his final hours. She even brought his ashes back to us. I can't thank her enough for this. We also had to move his appointment up and she was quick to move to his needs. I hope I don't need their services for a long time for my other fur babies but I will use her again in the very, very distant future.

> Putting my beloved Avery down was the hardest day of my life. While there is no easy way to do that, Dr. Noe made the experience so much better. From the moment she came to my house, her calm presence put everyone at ease, including my dog. She was professional, yet spoke as if she had known Avery for years. She gave us as much time as we needed to say goodbye to our baby without feeling rushed. After Avery passed, Dr. Noe gave a heartfelt speech and hugged us all. I couldn't imagine having to euthanize in any other way.

> The form for the service was very easy to complete. I appreciated this since making this decision was very difficult and I was fraught with emotion. I wanted my beloved cat Buddy to have a pain free transition at our home. He was 18 years. His decline was rapid; he became extremely ill in the span of a week with advanced kidney disease. Dr. Lutri was so gentle and loving to Buddy. She explained every step of the process and asked me before each step if I was ready to move to the next. Dr. Lutri was gracious, kind, and compassionate. She has the most peaceful, calm, loving presence and a profound caring for the pets she serves and their pet guardians. She comforted me greatly as she took care of my magnificent boy. She genuinely understood the magical connection I had with Buddy and treated him so tenderly when she put his sweet body into a beautiful bed to transport him the the crematorium. I felt like Dr. Lutri was an angel sent to me in my dire time of need and loss. She was exceptional in every way. She is a talented doctor overflowing with empathy and understanding who is beautiful inside and out.

> I’m truly grateful for CodaPet’s service in helping us schedule a qualified veterinarian on the same day. After assessing my cat’s quickly declining quality of life, being able to arrange a timely appointment was a bittersweet relief that ensured we didn’t prolong his suffering. Dr. April Le Blanc arrived on time and immediately put us at ease. She took the time to understand our cat’s condition, introduced herself to him gently, and answered all our questions with compassion. With over 30 years of veterinary experience—and as a parent to many of her own pets—her empathy and expertise were evident in every step of the process. Although saying goodbye to my dear cat was heart-wrenching, I’m grateful that his passing was peaceful and that I could be right beside him, doing everything I could to keep him at ease. Having the service done at home allowed our other cat to be present, which we hope helps her understand his passing. Dr. Le Blanc gave us all the time we needed afterward and offered heartfelt comfort during an incredibly difficult moment. I’m deeply thankful for her kindness and professionalism. I highly recommend Dr. April Le Blanc and CodaPet for anyone needing compassionate end of life care for their pet. She also followed up with grief-support resources, which I truly appreciate.

> Faced the difficult decision to euthanize our beloved 18 year old Papillon and used Codapet to do it in our home as our dog hated to go to the vet. Dr. Katie Todd arrived and explained in detail the process, gave us plenty of time to say our goodbyes, and made the process as easy as possible. She was very reassuring to my children that we had made the right decision and explained all the options for taking care of the remains and provided us with keepsakes to ease the family’s pain. Thank you so much Dr.Todd in doing what has to be one of the world’s toughest jobs!

My Luna never takes to new people, or people other than me actually, but Dr. Rob made her comfortable before her journey. Made me comfortable, too. Not easy in either case! But, handled with ease by Dr. Rob. The journey itself was handled with great care and compassion. No pain. Just a gentle sleep and a final good bye. I could not ask for a better experience on such a day. Thank you, from both Luna and I, Dr, Rob.
