Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I have loved animals from the time I can remember and pursuing veterinary medicine meant that I got to spend every day with the animals I love and helping them from all avenues. In my many years as a veterinarian, I deeply understand the challenges of treating critically ill patients and the nuances of end-of-life care. I am honored to help pets pass away peacefully in the comfort of their home and with their loving family at their side.

> On 07/29/2025, our 14-year-old Goldendoodle, Teddy, passed away peacefully. Dr. Gardhouse was very compassionate. When she arrived, she started to rub Teddy's paw. The thing is that Teddy never liked his paws rubbed, but in this case, it soothed him. Dr. Gardhouse explained the procedure well and answered our questions. She gave us plenty of time to say our goodbyes, and nothing was rushed. We will miss him dearly, but Dr. Gardhouse made the process so much better. We are so glad we did it at home. Also, compared to other services, the price for the service was way more reasonable. I highly recommend using CodaPet. John D.

> We used Coda-pet for our in home euthanasia for our beautiful 16 year old golden doodle. We were sent an angel, Dr Sara Gardhouse. She arrived on time and was extremely compassionate, explained the process and gave us time alone as we all said goodbye to Bella. I highly recommend Coda-pet and Dr Sara.

> Our dear very elderly Zoe ( dog) passed away. We did not want to see her go, although she was a grump we loved her. Our other dog was there, and I held Zoe's head in my lap. She just slipped away. I am grateful that my husband and I could hold her. She did not panic, have anxiety . Thank you Dr. Gardhouse. Jennifer and Tom Fox

> Dr. Sara recently helped us say goodbye to our sweet girl cat. It was such a hard time for us and she was very mindful of that. We are grateful to have done this at home and the service she provides is beyond appreciated. The compassion and empathy she shows means a lot. The Cremation company used was great and respectful. She was home within 8 days. We highly recommend this company and Dr.Sara."

> Dr Guardhouse was very compassionate during our appointment. Choosing to put our dog down at home was absolutely the best decision for us and our pet. Dr Gardhouse took her time to explain the process and make sure we were ready to move to the next step. Our dog's final minutes surrounded by family and getting plenty of love was the perfect way to say goodbye to our beloved pet.

> I highly recommend CodaPet for in-home euthanasia for your furry family member. Sara arrived right on time and gave us all of the time we needed to love on our dog Poppi. Sara was very careful with Poppi during the process and wrapped her in a blanket very lovingly to take her for cremation. While we miss our Poppi girl, we are truly happy with this entire experience. There was a lot less stress on both us and Poppi as she was very comfortable at home. I know no one wants to say goodbye to their fur kid, but this was a very peaceful way to be able to say goodbye without all of the stress of a car ride and then in the vet's office. Thank you, CodaPet for providing this service and thank you Sara for your wonderful care on our fur kid's final day with us.

> Dr. Gardhouse was very kind and compassionate throughout the entire process. Nothing could have made the day easier, but Dr. Gardhouse gave us all the time that we needed and to say our goodbyes and walked us through every step. We felt relieved knowing our Uno passed surrounded at home with a big belly full of salmon, surrounded by her loved ones and without pain.

> Dr. Sara went above and beyond for us when we chose humane in-home euthanasia for our beloved almost 13 year old dog we had to 11 wonderful years. He was extremely stressed out when he was at the dog hospital/vets office so we decided to bring him home and let him go peacefully in his favorite spot in the yard. He was loved and comfortable as much as he could be during the experience. Thank you Dr. Sara ❤️

> I had to make the painful decision of putting my dog, Luna, down, and wanted to do it at home. Not only was the price fair, but Dr. Gardhouse was amazing. She came earlier than the scheduled arrival time, had a very calm and caring demeanor, and answered all questions. She worked at my pace and enjoyed watching us give my girl a last meal of chicken nuggets, popcorn, and chocolate chips cookies. This decision was not easy, but Dr. Gardhouse was the perfect provider to use. She took great care of my girl and even sent a follow up card in the mail sending her regards. Could not recommend her enough, there’s a special place for humans like her that do this work?

> Sara came to our house to help us send our 17yo girl Poppi to the bridge. She was very kind, compassionate, and did everything she could to make sure we were comfortable with the process. We could tell that she really cared about us and Poppi, even though she had just met her. Sara made sure Poppi was comfortable and then made sure we were ready to let her go to the bridge. While this will always be the worst day for any pet parent, Sara made this day a lot easier with her kindness and care toward Poppi and us. Thank you for making this day just a bit easier. We do appreciate everything you did. Cat Raley

> Dr. Sara was awesome! She came a day earlier than scheduled, knowing my kittie was not doing well. Having my kittie put down at home was less stressful on our cat and us than taking her to the vet. Dr. Sara was also able to handle the cremation services afterwards. The cost was the same or less than what we would have paid at our vet. I would highly recommend having your pet euthanized at home. Thanks again, Dr. Sara!

> A very wonderful caring , warm and compassionate Dr Sara Gardhouse was the right person in my life to take care of my needs when it came to the final day of Rex’s life here on earth. She was accommodating to where I wanted. Rex euthanized . That to me was the greatest gift of all. Even though it rained all day, we went forward, so Rex wouldn’t suffer anymore. She answered questions I had after the procedure, when I was overwhelmed with heartbreak and grief, stating she was there for me if I needed. Dr. Sara Gardhouse, I can’t say enough how grateful I had her by our side, it was comforting. I would recommend her to anyone that needs in-home or out of home euthanasia. You’re in the best care with this great doctor.. thank you Leia Hanson
