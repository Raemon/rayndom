Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

As a veterinarian, I often feel that I am of most service to families at the end of their pet's life. I know how challenging caring for an aging or unwell pet can be, and I know how hard it is to say goodbye. The ability to grant animals a peaceful and stress-free death is a privilege. For my own pets, I prefer euthanasia at home when circumstances allow. I offer in-home euthanasia so I can give other pets in my community the same care that I give my own. My goals for euthanasia are to ensure a calm, stress-free death for pets and to be a nonjudgmental, compassionate partner for families facing this decision. We all want the best for our pets. When the best choice is euthanasia, I am honored to help.

> The Vet was on time. She was very considerate, professional and compassionate. The process went smoothly and painlessly. My wife and I were pretty emotional and she managed to navigate the process with out any added stress. If you're considering this, I highly recommend this service. My little dog fell asleep in my lap and was snoring her happy sleep snore. And then she drifted away. Way better than in a strange exam room on a cold steel table.
