Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I feel that the human-animal bond is a very unique and precious one - we view our pets as family and we want them to know they were loved always, especially in those last moments. I think this service, which allows pets to be in the comfort of their home, surrounded by family who are able to say goodbye at their own pace, is an extremely valuable service to be able to provide. I feel passionate about being able to provide a peaceful and dignified transition. I think this is a final kindness we can provide our pets who have always loved us unconditionally.

> Dr. Batey came to our house to let our 16 year old Yorkie pass. She was so gentle and very professional. Dr. Batey makes this trying time so much easier than in the Vet’s office. Our little Katie was comfortable and not scared which meant so much to us.

> I’m going to tell you the truth up front: any euthanasia is an excruciating decision. It’s one that pet parents never want to have to make. However, sometimes it becomes the only humane, reasonable option when our beloved pets are in pain or have no quality of life remaining. Additionally, at-home euthanasia gives you and your pet a sense of calm that neither of you will be able to find in any office anywhere. In their final moments, your beloved pets aren’t scared about an unfamiliar office, or unfamiliar smells or faces, but are comforted and surrounded by things and people they know and love. I’ve known Dr. Batey for years and can tell you, without any doubt, that there is no other person on Earth that I’d allow to care for my dogs and to help them in their transition beyond the sunset. Dr. Batey explained the process to us clearly, she was patient with us and she was completely accepting of any suggestions we had to make our beloved Govy’s transition easier not only for him, but for us as well. We will never be able to truly repay her expertise and kindness, but hope that when you have to make this heartbreaking decision, you let Dr. Batey help you and your loved one the way she helped us.

> Dr. Bates was wonderful to us and our dog during her final moments. She was extremely professional, very communicative about the process, and incredibly kind. I felt my pup was in great hands and she was completely comfortable when she passed. She gave us space to grieve and was additionally super sweet to our other animals.

> Dr. Batey came to us twice, once for a quality of life assessment. She adjusted the medications to a palliative approach and we were able to spend 3 more good months with our sweet girl. Maura was just a different creature at the vet than she was at home, and Dr. Batey was able to see a different side of her. Today Dr. Batey came again, and helped us let her go with patience, authenticity, kindness and understanding. She explained everything to us and allowed us to say goodbye in the most peaceful way possible. After 17 years of devotion, it was the best choice for us.

> In one of the hardest moments of our lives Dr Batey brought us so much comfort. I could tell she genuinely cares about animals and was so patient and kind. I really can’t say enough to express my gratitude. We never felt rushed or as if this was just a business transaction. It was the best outcome we could have hoped for at such a sad time.
