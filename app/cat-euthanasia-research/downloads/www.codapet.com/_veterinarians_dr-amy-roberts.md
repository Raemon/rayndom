Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I was raised on a family farm near Trenton, Missouri. My parents raised livestock and taught me the business of farming. I was in both 4-H and FFA and did chores on the farm. At the county fair I showed the family’s livestock. During my childhood, my family pets were a Siamese cat named Cindy and a Dalmatian named Lady. Always learning, I have studied acupuncture and herbal medicine at the Chi Institute in Riddick, Florida. I believe clients should have choices including holistic services. My goal is to provide the very best conventional medicine and a full menu of complementary services for her patients.

## What pet parents are saying

> Dr. Roberts was so caring and wonderful! It was such a difficult time and she was so understanding. She also explained that my love had probably been sick for a while since he had a large mass. It made me feel better about the decision. I couldn’t have asked for a more caring doctor to care for my love-Rico!

> Our beloved Frida just turned 20 years old this year. We knew she had several health problems, and that the time would come when we would have to say goodbye. Frida hated going to the vet, and got very stressed in the car. For this reason, we desperately wanted her to die peacefully at home. We had hoped that one day she would simply go to sleep and not wake up. But instead, she began to have a flare up with a chronic illness that made her incredibly sick and in pain. Last Wednesday, after hours and with our normal vet on medical leave (unavailable) we made a call for help to Coda Pet - at home pet euthanasia. Dr. Amy Roberts left right away. She was so kind and patient. Frida was so dehydrated, weak, and almost non-responsive already, but Dr. Roberts understood that we did not want her to hurt any longer. She didn't rush us, and even allowed our other pets time to say goodbye to their furbling. We will forever be grateful for the willingness to come quickly, and at night, to help our Frida cross over at peace, in our laps, by the fireplace, in our home. No amount of time is ever enough to be with our beloved babies, but at least we got to help her cross peacefully at home and with the help of a caring and patient vet. Thank you, CodaPet, and thank you Dr. Roberts.

> My Luca was just 4 years old and very ill. Going to the Vet’s office was stressful for him because of the exams he received while there. So when I found at home euthanasia, I knew that was the way to go. Let alone my other 2 dogs could say goodbye instead of wondering where he went. The experience was soothing and stress free. Thank you CodaPet for coming up with this service and thank you to Dr. Amy Roberts for being so kind and understanding. Sincerely, Mona

> Dr. Roberts was very kind and compassionate. She explained the whole process so there were no surprises. I really appreciated how she gave me and my family several moments to be with my dog as he was ready for his appointment and after. It was with great grace that she took him away after he passed, wrapping him gently in a blanket on a medical stretcher. It was a touching last moment with him instead of something sterilized, medical, conventional, and uncompassionate. I am also grateful she was able to do it in-home to relieve his stress of going to the vet. Dr. Roberts made a heartbreaking moment a little gentler.

> Dr. Roberts was very knowledgeable about greyhounds and as dedicated greyhound rescuers, that was important to us. It was a nice added plus. She was very kind, had no issues with our other 2 greyhounds. She took her time, made sure we were comfortable with our 15 year old Kenny's passing when the time came. She gave us time alone with him after his passing. It was also important for our other greyhounds to be able to say goodbye too.

> Having to let go of our beautiful 15 year old Scout, threw both my husband and I into a pit of despair. But, Doctor Amy made this very challenging situation a very beautiful experience for us. She was very gentle with us and made us feel comfortable and safe. She took her time, and gave us options. She was conversational, and even shared little tidbit about herself. She guided us through every step of the process, and even gave us a very thoughtful keepsake of our Scout's paw print. We were a mess of tears and sobs, but she did not even bat an eye and encouraged us to fully express ourselves as we said goodbye to our girl. Scout passed away peacefully, and quietly as we held her laying on a soft blanket that we placed beneath a flowering Poplar tree, right here in our home, Rosemary Lane. I 1000 percent recommend this service. It is worth every single penny..

> Dr. Amy Roberts could not have been more kind and compassionate, both to me and to my beloved cat Trace. He was a former feral, always very scared of vet visits. I was happy to learn about CodaPet, so I could offer Trace this one last act of kindness, to not frighten him with another trip. He passed peacefully on the sofa where he spent most of his final month, while being snuggled and petted by me. It was the best possible outcome. I will be using CodaPet in the future for my other cats and highly recommend them to others.

We didn't think Tillie was going to make it to the appointment time, but after sharing that with Dr. Roberts, she was able to move her schedule around a bit and come almost an hour sooner. We're SO thankful that Tillie was able to die peacefully at home surrounded by those who loved her the most but minus the stress and anxiety, that both human and pet feel, when making these sort of trips to a vet's office. Thank you so much Dr. Roberts, Tillie was such a loving soul, it's only fitting that we were able to repay her that love & comfort at the end of her life. She will be missed.

> Annie was so special to me, like a child. She was with me over 14 years. There was no way I could have taken her into a vet's office and had her 'put down'. Annie deserved so much more. We chose in-home pet euthanasia and would never do it any other way. Annie was eating treats out of my hand and didn't notice the sedation she was given. She became groggy and we helped her lay into her bed. Dr. Roberts asked us when we were ready, and sat in her car after, giving us time with Annie. Dr. Roberts text as soon as I made the appointment and followed up after. This was one of the most difficult decisions I've ever had to make, and I felt validated, reassured, and most importantly Annie was in her own home. She wasn't afraid in an office. She was surrounded by love and in her comfort zone. She had dignity and grace.

> Dr. Amy Roberts was wonderful! Compassionate and so patient. Lacy is a 14yr 8 month old Lab, her back legs just gave out on Wednesday, I fixed a sling to help her outside and around the yard. Her spirit was still willing, while her legs were not. Broke my heart. On July 12, 2025, Dr Roberts came, talked with us and Lacy, we were on a blanket outside, Dr. Amy said feed her anything she wanted. Lacy dined on chocolate and hotdogs and when we were ready, the sedative was given, couple minutes later, Lacy was asleep, we talked to her caressed her and when we were ready, the final step was completed. In home euthanasia is the only way to help your pet cross over. Lacy was at home, not stressed and happily eating. This was worth it weight in gold. Thank you Dr. Amy Roberts!

While it was a very difficult decision, she made me understand that I was making the right choice in relieving my pet’s pain from cancer in the most peaceful way I could have possibly imagined. After Dr. Amy introduced herself to me and my Rottweiler, Ember, she never once made me feel rushed the entire time she was here. After giving Ember treats, Dr. Amy began the procedure of sedating her, and the waited patiently until I was ready to complete the process. After the process was complete, Dr. Amy excused herself and waited outside for me to say my last goodbyes. Again, which I cannot stress enough, in a manner of which I never felt rushed. I honestly don’t know how long I took, but knowing I had as much time as necessary provided a tremendous comfort to me. When I was done, Dr. Amy loaded Ember up on a stretcher and covered her with a soft blanket for transport. The entire time, I felt my baby girl was in good hands and being taken care of in this difficult moment. I can easily see why everyone has given perfect reviews.

> As hard as it is to say goodbye to a pet, Dr. Amy Robert’s really made it as smooth of a process as possible. Not having to take my sick dog to the vet & getting to say goodbye & spend our last moments in our own home really made the process easier & more comforting. She was very sweet & understanding & I would fully recommend.

> Fantastic. Very friendly and gentle about the situation. My family copes with humor and she adjusted very quickly even as we were switching from humor to crying. This was a 17 year old cat and the whole family was going through a lot of emotions all at once.

> Matt was not able to be there so as grandparents Bill and I were there for our St on in this time of need. The Doctor talked us through every step. Thing time was hard as a grandma but even harder because it was on my 68th birthday that we had to put down our granddaughter but she is not in pain anymore. Thank you Dr Amy for the wonderful job.

> Dr. Roberts was fantastic. She genuinely showed care and love for our Ben, was extremely cognizant of our time and need for being with him as much as possible. She made it a much better experience than it may have been at a vet or otherwise. Highly recommend her services for you and your pet.

> Dr Amy was so compassionate. The circumstances for utilizing a service like Coda Pet or in home euthanasia are never ideal. However, she was professional. Very communicative, gentle, and caring.
