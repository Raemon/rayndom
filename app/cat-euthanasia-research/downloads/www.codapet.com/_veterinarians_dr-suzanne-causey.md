Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

Veterinary medicine has been a passion since my teenage years after I experienced the traumatic loss of one of my own pets. Our pets play incredibly important roles in our lives and the human-animal bond is often as strong as our bonds with other loved ones. The loss of a pet can be very difficult. I have always been gifted to be with people who are suffering and I believe this unique skillset of medical and soft skills provides me with the ability to serve clients who desire in-home euthanasia services.
