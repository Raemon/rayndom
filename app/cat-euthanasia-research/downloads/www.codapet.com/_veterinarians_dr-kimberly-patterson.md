Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I became a veterinarian because it combined my passion for animals, the human-animal bond, and science and medicine. I have explored multiple types of practice during my career, and I feel I can make a meaningful difference for people and their pets by offering in-home euthanasia. My goal is to make an emotionally difficult time more peaceful for our pets and for the families that love them.

> There aren't words to describe about how wonderful Dr. Patterson was in helping my sweet girl cross over the Rainbow Bridge. She spoke so gently and kindly as she explained the procedure and what to expect. She showed Molly so much love. I'm so grateful that my girl was able to pass so peacefully at home, and with such an empathetic human. Thank you so much.

> While it is never easy to say goodbye to a beloved pet, Dr. Patterson made the process a bit easier. Our 15 year old lab, Lucy, always got sick during car rides and was nervous at the vet, so having Dr. Patterson come to our home was the best option for us. This way, even though she wasn't feeling well, Lucy was excited to see a visitor at home, rather than the stress of the vets office in her final moments. Dr. Patterson explained each part of the process, so we knew what to expect. She was very compassionate and we appreciated how caring she was with our family and Lucy.

> The peace and comfort that in home pet euthanasia gives really goes beyond words. The grief will be the same. But knowing you are there to comfort them during their final moments is priceless. Dr. Kim was very compassionate and explained exactly what was happening. I miss my Shay, who was my companion for almost 17yrs. Thank you, Dr Kim. Dana & Shay July 29, 2025

> After 14 and a half wonderful years with my dog Angel, sadly the time came to have her euthanized. I did a brief search online, and was very fortunate to have found Dr. Kim Patterson. Angel had an amazing, happy, love filled life! She was my buddy and we went everywhere together. Our journey in life has come to a close, and I am very thankful to have had Dr. Kim help make the final moments come to a peaceful ending. I just picked up Angel's urn yesterday. I am so happy to have her back home now where she belongs right by the living room coffee table in her favorite spot. The house is different now........but I am at peace. Thank you Dr. Kim for your professionalism from start to finish, and thank you for your compassion from the first time I met you at the front door, to the last time we gently lifted Angel into your vehicle.

> Dr. Patterson was extremely compassionate, kind, and professional. Making the decision to euthanize a pet is never easy. Being able to hold my pet at home where he felt safe and loved while making a peaceful transition was the last gift I was able to give my boy. Dr. Patterson was so gentle and treated my Leroy, throughout the entire process with nothing but dignity. I would highly recommend these services and wouldn’t hesitate to use CodaPet and Dr. Patterson again should the need arise.
