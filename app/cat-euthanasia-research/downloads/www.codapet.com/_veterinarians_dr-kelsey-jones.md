Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

People often believe performing humane euthanasia for pets is the hardest part of a veterinarian’s job; it is difficult but it is not the hardest thing we do. I find comfort in the process because it provides a compassionate, safe and kind option to alleviate pet suffering. It allows us as their caregivers to shepherd them over the rainbow bridge with the dignity and respect they deserve. Providing this service at home allows pets to pass peacefully surrounded by their favorite people, toys, and smells and allows their loved ones (including furry siblings) space to grieve in private.

## What pet parents are saying

> Dr. Kelsey Jones is an angle. We had to suddenly make a decision on a Saturday morning to put our 18 year old baby down due to worsening health issues. I was able to get an appointment in the later afternoon. Dr. Jones called a little before to speak with me and see if I had any questions. She arrived on time and spent time talking with me about my pet and life. Dr. Jones throughly explained everything step by step as she went and at my speed. She is so caring, empathic, and compassionate. I can’t recommend her enough.
