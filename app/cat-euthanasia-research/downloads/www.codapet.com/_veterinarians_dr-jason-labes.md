Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

Veterinary school was a later-life choice for me, springing from a desire to be more deeply involved with the medical care of the cats at the rescue group I volunteered with. I have worked in small animal and mixed animal general practice, emergency medicine, and been the medical director of an emergency hospital. Recently, I started my own mobile/house call practice to get back to a closer connection with my patients and their families. Just before I left for veterinary school, a friend came to my house to euthanase my family's 14 year old dog. It was such a kind and meaningful gesture, and I decided that once I had graduated from school, I would pass on that kindness and always offer IHE services to others who wanted them.

## What pet parents are saying

> Dr.Labes was excellent in a difficult situation. He was very understanding and talked us through what was going to happen and as it happened. He was respectful of our pet and his remains, and facilitated the return of the ashes so it was easy for collect them. He made the awful experience a little easier.
