Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

Working with companion animals and providing them care has always been my motivation to be a veterinarian. Providing humane and compassionate end of life care is an important component of both veterinary medicine and the human-animal bond. In my personal past experience with my own pets and in speaking to others, being able to say goodbye to a beloved companion in the comfort of your own home makes a difficult time just a little less stressful. I believe it is important to be able to provide this service to both pets and their people in this time of need.

## What pet parents are saying

> Recently had to say goodbye to my best friend, the spectacularly beautiful Josie. Dr. Christina came to my home and helped give Josie a quiet passing. I was able to hold Josie in my arms and have the least amount of stress for her.I appreciate Dr. Christina’s gentle manner and her kindness, and the respectful way she handled the entire encounter including how broken up I was to lose my buddy. We opted for cremation, and that too was handled with so much respect and care. I truly appreciate the compassionate care of this in-home euthanasia.

> My experience with in-home pet euthanasia, and Dr. Christina Meiners, was a very professional and peaceful experience. I had a 2 week period where I vacillated on the exact date… And Christina was 100% there for me, even though we had never met. She was an utmost professional, yet kind and caring. The time was right to send my Dallas kitty off… And I so appreciated her empathy. I might not have read the small print… But fortunately, before she came over, I realized I was going to be by myself with her… And had a friend come over, which was key to my emotional process of letting go… Just a caveat to those who might need someone else besides Christina by their side. Thank you for everything you do!

> Dr. Meiners was just wonderful. She came to our home to put our kitty, Socks, to sleep. He had stopped eating, and stopped urinating. He was very sick. We had adopted him 5 months earlier, he had been in a shelter for 2 years prior. He was 10 years old. He had been described as skittish, but he had gotten more towards feral at the shelter. We were never able to pet him, but he was very sweet and was making progress, albeit slowly. We could not take him to the vet as we could not touch him. Dr. Meiners was exceedingly kind and patient and was able to do what had to be done. It was a sad day, we loved our little Socks kitty. Dr. Meiners was just exactly the right person in a delicate situation. We were lucky to have her here that day. Linda and John Kensey
