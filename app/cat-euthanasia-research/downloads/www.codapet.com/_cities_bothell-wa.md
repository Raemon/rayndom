Dr. Kemper was so kind and gentle with our family as we let our beloved dog go. She listened to our stories about her and gave us all the time we needed to say goodbye. We are so grateful that she brought peace to such a painful day.

Dr. Martin was wonderful. Kind, thoughtful, informative, and skilled at the task of painlessly helping my best friend, Sunny the cat, move on to her next life. He also listened patiently. I am really grateful for Dr. Martin's excellent, compassionate care.

After a wonderful and too short 16 years, our darling little dog Lola let us know it was time for her to go. We chose home euthanasia in order to give her as peaceful a passing as possible. Dr Carol showered us with compassion and kindness. She arrived promptly on schedule, was professional yet unhurried, and very attentive to our needs. It's been almost 3 weeks since Lola left us and I'm only just now able to write this review. The package we received in picking up her ashes exceeded our expectation in its attention to detail. Giving us that last paw print on a plaque, which we didn't think about in the moment of grief, was so perfect. The loss of Lola has been so painful. However, because Dr Carol thought of everything that we couldn't in that moment, we are comforted in knowing that Lola went surrounded in love and care. Dr Carol is amazing. She cares about your animals AND you.

I made a last-minute appointment when my 14-year-old cat 'crashed' due to cancer. He had been doing well, but in the space of a day just suddenly went downhill and was obviously in his last hours. My vet had recommended a couple in home pet euthanasia services, since my cat is very fearful of strangers and taking him to a vet or hospital would have been extremely traumatic. I contacted Codapet and was able to schedule Dr. Bonnie Goldthwaite for the same day. Dr. Goldthwaite called ahead to review the process, listened to all my concerns, and helped work out a plan to mitigate the stranger-fear. She was prompt, knowledgeable, and kind at a terrible time. She explained the process before we started, and kept me informed through every step. The icing on the cake was the sweet wicker basket and homemade blankets she wrapped my sweetheart in to take him away. I will definitely recommend this service, and Dr. Goldthwaite, to anyone who finds themselves in this situation. It's awful to go through, and having a goodhearted guide makes a huge difference.

### Cancellation policy or pet passing

We charge cancellation fee of $100 if an appointment is cancelled less than 4 hours before the start time. If your pet passes away before your appointment you would not be charged a cancellation fee.

[Personalize Quote](/schedule-appointment "Personalize Quote")

## Other Consideration

### Large Animals

If you have a larger pet, your vet may need the help of one friend or family member. Talk to your vet about options and limitations when they reach out to you prior to your appointment, and they will inform you of any extra cost for your situation. 

### How do I get my pet’s ashes

Options for your pets return home and memorabilia depend on your local provider. Your vet coordinate the return of your pet’s ashes and let you know if there are additional fees for urn delivery. 

### Special factors affecting price

Extra time or medications needed can affect the total price. Other factors can be if it is decided that it’s not time to euthanize your pet after the vet has arrive. In that case, only the travel fee, platform fee, and a quality of life consult would apply. 

## FAQs

### What’s included in the total cost?

The total cost includes the in-home pet euthanasia service fee, any travel fee (if any apply), and a platform fee. Additionally, depending on your choice, fees may apply for cremation services or keepsakes.

### Will the vet take my pet with them after the appointment?

During your appointment, your vet will confirm your aftercare selection with you. If you choose to arrange cremation services, your vet will oversee your pet’s transportation to a local facility for cremation. If your preferred cremation option includes the return of your pet’s ashes to you, your vet will discuss the process to reunite you with your pet's ashes and the anticipated time frame during your appointment

### Will the vet examine my pet once they get to my home?

Yes, upon arrival the veterinarian will assess your pet. This can look different than an “nose to tail” examination in a clinic setting and will focus more on the pet’s history and quality of life.

### What if I am not sure it is time?

It is not uncommon to have doubts about whether the time is right. If you’ve taken the Quality of Life Questionnaire and are still unsure, we recommend consulting with your family veterinarian before scheduling an appointment.  
  
Rest assured, if you book an appointment, your in-home euthanasia veterinarian will let you know if they do not believe that euthanasia is appropriate at this time.

### How long will the procedure take?

You can expect your veterinarian to be in your home from 20-60 minutes, depending on how much of that time you need or want throughout the process.

### What is an home pet euthanasia, and how does it work?

An home pet euthanasia allows your pet to pass away peacefully in the comfort of your home surrounded by love. A compassionate veterinarian will provide end-of-life care for your pet starting with an initial end-of-life exam followed by sedation to ensure your pet is comfortable. Your vet will always move at your pace so you have the time you need to say your goodbyes. Once you are ready, your vet will administer medication to help them gently and painlessly say goodbye surrounded by comfort and love.

### How do I tell if my pet is suffering?

Signs your pet may be suffering include chronic pain, difficulty breathing, loss of appetite, inability to stand or walk, or a loss of interest in daily activities. These symptoms could indicate a decline in their quality of life. You know your pet better than anyone, but speaking to a veterinarian can help you assess whether euthanasia is the most compassionate option. If you feel you need more help, you can read our guide on ‘[How will I know it’s time](https://www.codapet.com/how-will-i-know-when-its-time)’, take a [quality of life assessment](https://www.codapet.com/quality-of-life-scale), or call customer care at 833-263-2738.

### What should I do if my pet is declining fast?

If your pet's health is declining rapidly, it’s crucial to take the following steps:

  * **Consult Your Veterinarian:** Schedule an appointment to discuss your observations and any scoring from a quality-of-life scale. This information can help guide the conversation about your pet's condition and options moving forward. Your vet may suggest palliative care, hospice, or, if necessary, euthanasia.  

  * **Ensure Comfort:** Create a quiet, cozy space with soft bedding and easy access to food, water, and a litter box (if applicable).  

  * **Minimize Stress:** Keep routines simple and familiar, and limit loud noises or disruptions.  

  * **Offer Gentle Care:** Provide a soothing touch through gentle petting and offer favorite treats if they can still eat.  

  * **Consider At-Home Euthanasia:** If appropriate, discuss the option of at-home euthanasia with your vet for a peaceful and familiar passing.  

  * **Reach Out for Support:** It's okay to lean on loved ones, pet-loss support groups, or counselors to help navigate this difficult time.



If you're noticing signs of declining health, we encourage you to use our [quality of life scale ](https://www.codapet.com/quality-of-life-scale)assessment to evaluate your pet's condition before your vet visit.

### What is the difference between in home pet euthanasia and euthanasia at a vet clinic?

The key difference is the setting. At home euthanasia allows your pet to pass peacefully in the comfort of their familiar surroundings, reducing stress and anxiety. This option especially benefits pets who may feel scared or uncomfortable traveling to a clinic. It also offers your family a private, intimate experience during this emotional time. While some urgent situations don’t allow for time to schedule in-home euthanasia, many pet owners in Bothell choose in-home services for the peaceful atmosphere and compassionate care their pets receive right where they feel safest. You can [find flexible availability](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment) for our local vets here, or look for [same-day euthanasia](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request) appointments.

### Will my pet experience any pain during euthanasia?

No, pet euthanasia at home is designed to be completely painless. After an initial end-of-life assessment, your veterinarian will first administer a sedative to ensure your pet is relaxed and comfortable. The euthanasia medication then gently stops the heart without causing pain. The process is peaceful and allows your pet to pass without distress.

### Is there a service provider for in home pet euthanasia near me?

We have [a network of compassionate veterinarians](https://www.codapet.com/cities) serving many cities across the US who provide pet euthanasia at home for your beloved dog, cat, or other pets. You can [find a local vet near you](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment) in the next 7 days or call 833-263-2738 to get help from our customer care team.

### Do you provide 24-hour pet euthanasia services?

While we do not offer 24-hour pet euthanasia services, we do provide after-hours and emergency care in greater Bothell. You can request [same-day and urgent appointments](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request) to ensure your pet receives the compassionate care they need during critical moments.

### Is there an additional fee for after-hours or emergency services?

Yes, there is typically an additional fee for after-hours or emergency appointments. You can view the estimate when you request a [same-day or urgent appointment](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request).

### How much does in home euthanasia cost for pets in my area?

The cost of in home pet euthanasia can vary in Bothell and the surrounding areas. Once you have picked your provider, the cost will usually depend on your pet’s size and any additional services you may choose, such as cremation, keepsakes, or other services. Our services start with a base fee of $360 for in home euthanasia. If your vet is traveling further than their local area, there is a travel fee applied based on how far you are from them. At CodaPet, we believe in giving you complete transparency and control over what you are choosing for your pet’s end-of-life care. This is why you can view a detailed price estimate before you complete reserving a time with your local vet. You can view [flexible availability and detailed pricing](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment) or request a [same-day appointment](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request) if this is more urgent. If you have any further questions, you can view our [FAQs](https://www.codapet.com/faqs) or reach us (833) 263 - 2738.

### Is the cost of euthanasia the same for both dogs and cats?

Most providers in Bothell charge a flat fee for euthanasia, although some providers do charge based on the size of your pet, so small dogs and cats can be the same price; however, medium or large-size dogs (such as Bulldogs, Australian Shepherds, Labradors, or German Shepherds) will likely carry a higher price. At CodaPet, most vets charge a flat fee for both dogs and cats; however, if there is a large pet fee, it will be applied automatically for you to review in the price estimate when you reserve an appointment. You can view the detailed [pricing and availability here](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment) or call us at (833) 263 - 2738.

### What should I expect during an in home pet euthanasia appointment?

During an in home euthanasia appointment, your veterinarian will make an assessment of your pet’s health and quality of life to provide guidance to ensure your decision is informed. The veterinarian will administer an initial sedative or anesthetic to help your pet relax and become pain-free, ensuring they are comfortable and at ease. In the last stage, your veterinarian will first ensure your pet is fully sedated before gently administering anesthesia which will quickly slow down your pet’s respiratory system until the heart finally stops beating. In most cases, this process takes less than a minute. Your veterinarian will always move at your pace so the process is as comfortable as possible for your pet and your family.

### Can I choose a specific veterinarian for my pet’s euthanasia?

Yes, you can always choose the veterinarian you prefer, at the times they have available to reserve. You can see their [real-time availability](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment) or request a [same-day urgent appointment](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request) if no time suits your needs.

If you have any questions or specific needs, please don’t hesitate to reach out at (833) 263 - 2738.

### How far in advance do I need to make an appointment?

The notice for every veterinarian differs, however, most veterinarians require at least a **2-hour notice** from the time you need them to arrive at your home. This allows them time to prepare and ensure they can provide the highest level of care and compassion for your pet. It also accounts for their travel time, as your veterinarian may be traveling from many different locations around Bothell.

While you can request a [same-day and emergency services](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request), it's always best to contact us as early as possible to ensure availability and to give both you and your veterinarian time to prepare for this important moment.

### What should I expect in terms of my pet’s behavior during the pet euthanasia process?

During the euthanasia process, your pet will be gently guided to a state of peace and comfort. After a sedative is administered, you can expect them to become calm and relaxed, free from any pain or distress. When the final injection is given, your pet will slowly drift off into a deep sleep before passing away peacefully. Your compassionate veterinarian will ensure the process is as gentle and serene as possible, allowing you to be present with your beloved companion in their final moments of love and care.

### Can I be with my pet during the euthanasia process?

Yes, during the in home euthanasia process, you are encouraged to be with your pet throughout the entire process. Being there provides comfort and reassurance to your pet as they pass peacefully.

### How do I know when it’s time to consider euthanasia for my pet?

Every pet is different, and you know yours better than anyone, however, it may be time to consider euthanasia when you notice more ‘bad days than good’. It’s important to keep an eye on your pet’s quality of life and try to understand when it has declined, such as no longer enjoying activities or suffering from unmanageable pain. To help you understand their quality of life, you take a [Quality of Life Assessment](https://www.codapet.com/quality-of-life-scale), which helps you get a more clear picture of your pet’s well-being at this point in time.

Remember, if you are unsure, speaking with your primary care veterinarian can help better understand your pet’s quality of life. It’s important to speak with your primary care veterinarian if you haven’t yet to understand your pet’s health. If you do not have a primary care veterinarian, consider visiting an urgent care or emergency hospital in your area.

  


### How should I prepare my home for my pet’s euthanasia?

### How long does the euthanasia procedure typically take?

**In home euthanasia** procedures usually take about 10-15 minutes, however, the total time can vary depending on the pace you and your family prefer to move at and your pet’s comfort level. Your veterinarian will take the time necessary to ensure you feel you have enough time to be with your beloved pet while also ensuring your pet is calm and relaxed before proceeding. In some cases, this may take longer, especially if your pet is anxious or uncomfortable.

We understand that saying goodbye is a deeply emotional experience, and we encourage families to take as much time as they need during the process. Our goal is to create a peaceful and compassionate environment for both you and your pet.

### What should I do after the euthanasia procedure is completed?

After the euthanasia, you are welcome to spend as much time as you need with your pet to say goodbye. If you’ve chosen any cremation services to handle your pet’s body, your veterinarian will reconfirm your choices and gently transport your pet when you are ready. If you’ve chosen any keepsakes offered by the crematorium, like Claw Paw Prints, Ink nose prints, or other memorabilia, your veterinarian will reconfirm your choices before leaving your home. If you have any questions or want to change your mind about any of your choices, you can discuss your options with your veterinarian before they leave your home.

### What are my options for cremation?

After the i**n home euthanasia** procedure, your veterinarian will provide you with time to say goodbye to your pet. Once you're ready, they will re-confirm the preferred aftercare option that you choose when reserving your time with your veterinarian. In Bothell you can select two types of cremation services:

  * **Individual Cremation (Ashes Returned):** An individual cremation is a process where your pet will be cremated separated with physical barriers in the chamber. This ensures the separation with other pets in the chamber so you may reunite with your pet’s ashes. Your pet’s ashes will be returned to you in an urn of your choice. If you choose an additional urn then your pet’s ashes will be returned in the urn of your choice.  

  * **Communal Cremation (No Ashes Returned):** A communal cremation is a process where your pet is cremated in a chamber with other pets. Once the process is complete, the crematorium will respectfully scatter your pet’s remains among other pets. It’s important to note, you pet’s ashes will not be returned to you.



Some of our veterinarians offer an additional option known as **Private Cremation (Ashes Returned)**. In this option, only your pet is in the cremation chamber, ensuring that the recovered ashes are solely your pet's. These ashes can be returned in an urn of your choice, with additional urn options available. To see if private cremation is available with your provider, please refer to our [booking page](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment).

**Note** : If you choose to leave your pet's body with your veterinarian, rest assured it will be handled with the utmost care, respect, and dignity. Your veterinarian will coordinate all aftercare arrangements as requested, allowing you to focus on yourself and your family after this difficult goodbye.

### How do I get my pet’s ashes back?

Your veterinarian will coordinate the return of your pet’s ashes before they leave your home. Your options include having your pet’s remains delivered by your veterinarian (for an additional fee), shipping them to you (for an additional fee), or picking them up from your primary clinic or the crematorium.

### Are there any low-cost or no-cost pet euthanasia solutions?

Saying goodbye to a beloved pet is never easy, and we understand that cost can be a concern for many pet parents. While we specialize in premium in-home euthanasia services, we also want to acknowledge that cost may be a concern. If you're looking for low-cost or no-cost pet euthanasia options in Bothell, consider reaching out to the following:

  * **Local Animal Shelters & Humane Societies** – Many provide low-cost or donation-based euthanasia services, often with cremation options.  

    * **Seattle Animal Shelter  
** 2061 15th Avenue W, Seattle, WA 98

  * **Low-Cost Veterinary Clinics & Nonprofits** – Some vet clinics and nonprofits offer reduced-cost euthanasia, sometimes supported by grants or donations.  

    * **Greenwood Animal Hospital  
** 10000 Aurora Avenue N, Ste 8, Seattle, WA 98133

    * **Companion Pet Clinic of Seattle

(206) 257-0504  

  * **Animal Control Services** – In certain cases, local animal control agencies may offer euthanasia services for terminally ill or suffering pets at a lower cost.



**Note:** When considering a low-cost pet euthanasia option, it's important to call ahead to check availability, as some providers may require an appointment or have eligibility criteria, such as income-based assistance. Be sure to ask about additional costs, including cremation or aftercare services, which may not be included in the base price. Additionally, verify service details, as some options may have restrictions based on your pet’s size, health condition, or location.

While low-cost options are available, many pet parents choose in-home euthanasia to ensure a peaceful, stress-free farewell in the comfort of their home. If you're looking for a private, compassionate experience, we’re here to help.

### Who are the veterinarians providing at-home pet euthanasia services in Bothell?

If you're searching for at-home pet euthanasia in Bothell and the surrounding areas, you're in compassionate hands with our local veterinarian. Below, you can learn more about their professional journey and what inspired them to offer peaceful in-home euthanasia services.

**Dr. Stephanie Norman** has spent over three decades devoted to veterinary medicine, with the last 22 years serving the Seattle area. A Texas A&M graduate, she began caring for animals as early as kindergarten and has since worked with species ranging from beloved pets to marine mammals. Her career has included both local practice and international aid efforts, always driven by her deep compassion for animals and their families.

Now partnering with CodaPet, Dr. Norman offers in-home euthanasia services to help families say goodbye in a familiar, peaceful setting. With her wealth of experience and calming presence, she is honored to support pets and their people through this final, meaningful act of love.

**Dr. Carol Earls** is a compassionate and experienced veterinarian who brings both warmth and wisdom to her work. After earning her undergraduate degree from the University of Michigan in 1990, she began her career as a high school teacher. But it wasn’t long before she returned to her childhood dream of becoming a veterinarian—a dream evidenced by the meticulous medical records she once kept for her stuffed animals. With her three-year-old daughter by her side, Dr. Earls pursued her veterinary degree at The Ohio State University, graduating in 2000.

Over the past two decades, she has built lasting relationships with families while providing a wide range of veterinary care, from preventive medicine and dentistry to surgery and end-of-life support. Today, Dr. Earls focuses on in-home pet euthanasia, where she finds deep meaning in helping pets and their families during one of life’s most tender transitions. Her goal is to create a peaceful, loving experience free from the stress and anxiety of a clinical setting—ensuring that every pet’s final moments are as gentle and dignified as possible.

**Dr. Lane Martin** has spent most of his life in the Pacific Northwest, where his deep compassion for animals and dedication to veterinary medicine have made him a trusted presence in the Seattle area. He earned his undergraduate degree from the University of Washington in 2003, followed by his Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from Oregon State University in 2011.

After graduation, Dr. Martin returned home to begin a fulfilling 13-year career in small animal practice. Over time, he discovered that helping families through the end-of-life journey with their pets was the most meaningful part of his work. Dr. Martin brings empathy, patience, and respect to every visit, offering in-home euthanasia as a peaceful and personal way to say goodbye. For him, it is not only a service—it is a profound honor to support families in one of their most emotional and vulnerable moments.

**Dr. Bonnie Goldthwaite** brings a unique blend of empathy, experience, and down-to-earth care to every family she serves. Raised on a small farm in Wisconsin, her early bond with animals was forged among hay bales and barn chores—less glamorous than the mall outings her friends enjoyed, but far more meaningful to her. After earning a degree in English Literature from Boston University, she returned to her true calling, completing her DVM at the University of Minnesota in 2003.

Now a long-time resident of South Seattle, Dr. Goldthwaite has spent over 15 years supporting pets and their families in her community. She finds the deepest fulfillment in guiding families through the emotional process of saying goodbye. Whether she’s helping parents talk to children about loss, offering a compassionate perspective on quality-of-life decisions, or simply providing a calming presence, Dr. Goldthwaite ensures every goodbye is filled with love, dignity, and peace.

With nearly two decades of experience in veterinary medicine, **Dr. Kristin Kemper** is known throughout the Pacific Northwest for her gentle presence and clinical excellence. After earning her undergraduate degree from Western Washington University, she went on to graduate from Washington State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine in 2004. Over the years, she has developed a deep appreciation for the unique bond between pets and their families.

As her career evolved, Dr. Kemper found her most meaningful work in helping beloved pets pass peacefully, surrounded by the people who love them. Her longstanding dedication to in-home euthanasia allows her to offer not only medical care, but comfort, dignity, and support during one of life’s most emotional moments. She feels privileged to walk alongside families during this time, ensuring a compassionate and serene goodbye.

> Dr. Clark could not have been a more kind, compassionate and patient veterinarian. He’s also very experienced and made what I expected to be a traumatic experience (in home pet euthanasia) as peaceful as it could be and I will be forever grateful for that. I felt awful that I waited a day or two too long before making the decision, but having Dr. Clark be the one to help us was the right choice. We’ll now be taking our other dog to his practice for care.

> Using CodaPet was so easy; from searching for a vet near me to clear pricing. Once booked they remained in constant communication with me throughout the process, providing time updates, etc. Our family was matched with Dr.Kelsey Jones and I can not recommend her enough. She arrived promptly, listened to our concerns, examined our furbaby Ciddy and gave us ample time to grieve and make the final decision. At no moment did I feel pressured to rush. She gave us time to set up an area outside and spoke to us like a friend throughout the process, while treating all of us with respect and compassion. She even made a suggestion on how to allow our other dog to say goodbye (which I would never have thought of). It’s not an easy choice to let go of a beloved pet but i feel this was the best way to do it and highly recommend her services.

> We thank Dr Kemper from our hearts for coming to our house to release Pantera from end stage kidney disease. She was so compassionate and caring, told us exactly what to expect from each step. The procedure was fast and Pantera did not feel any pain. We still are in mourning, BUT we know we did the right thing for our sweet lil kitty and companion of 20 years. Thank you, Dr Kemper. You are a bright Light.

> Dr. Kemper is truly the most kind and compassionate Veterinarian I have ever met. She came to our home, met our beloved pet, helped us grieve, and provided our 22 year old kitty the most peaceful transition possible. It takes an incredible soul to do the work they do. And we are forever grateful. I couldn’t have asked for a better experience for a member of our family. She went above and beyond. Thank you Dr. Kemper, and please keep helping other families and their beloved pets as long as you can.

> It's such a hard and difficult decision to make, but I am so thankful that there are people who are willing to do this service. Our 13.5-year-old dog Layla was at the end of her battle with cancer and let us know it was time. After booking our appointment, she was having a rough night, and I was easily able to contact Dr. Kemper and change the time from the afternoon to the morning. She was very compassionate, explained all the steps and answered any questions. Layla passed very peacefully, and our cats were able to say goodbye as well.

> We had a sudden need for home pet euthanasia for our beloved little dog, Jellybean. None of our local vets offered the service timely, so we had to try an unknown. I found CodaPet online and there were appointments available. Dr. Gordon at CodaPet was wonderful. The whole process went smoothly. Communication was thorough. She was a little late, but kept us updated (because you can't rush these things). She said all the right things and comforted us in our decision. We are heartbroken, but at least this part will be a good memory. Our pup was at home, peaceful, and not stressed out by being at the vet. We pet him, cried, told stories, and he just fell asleep. People who provide this service are special people. We SO appreciated being home for his final day. We would not hesitate to recommend Dr. Gordon if you unfortunately need this service.

> Our cat had reached the untreatable senior age of 18, and it meant a lot to say goodbye from the comfort of his home instead of taking him to the vet, where his last experience would've been stressful and upsetting for him. Interacting with Dr. Jessica was exactly what I was looking for during such a tough experience. Prompt, respectful, professional, and gentle. We thank her and CodaPet for their service.

> Dr. Kemper was so kind, compassionate and gentle as we said goodbye to our Cookie. She explained the process completely and reassured us our pup was comfortable and pain free throughout. Cookie was able to peacefully cross over in her favorite spot in the front yard and we avoided the fear and trauma she would have experienced from a last trip to the vet. I can't speak highly enough of in-home euthanasia and Dr. Kemper specifically. I'll definitely choose this again the next time we have to say goodbye to a fur-baby.

> Dr. Orth was wonderful! She responded very quickly, which seemed like a miracle for us. She was very thorough and kind with our distressed older cat. She quickly assessed our cat Ronnie and agreed it was time. She explained what she would do and what would happen. She was very gentle and kind with our pet. She arrived totally prepared and acted to calm Ronnie and make the visit as comforting as possible. We can’t say enough good things about her professionalism and kindness to our pet and my husband and me. It’s very clear she loves animals. We would highly recommend her to help your cat in Sanger, CA area.

It was a personal & loving way to say goodbye.

> Jessica, with CodaPet, and Kristin, the vet, were both always emotionally supportive as we journeyed through our 4-footed family member's final uncertain days. When multiple cancer tumors are ravaging your pet's body, it's hard to know the best time to say goodbye, not wanting him to suffer yet allowing for as many of the remaining good days as possible. The right choice doesn't always feel good, but Kristin and Jessica helped make the transition as compassionate as possible. Forever thank you.

> Amazing. I went online in the morning at 6am and scheduled for 11am. They even have a link for more urgent response. Dr. Alex was incredibly compassionate and professional. I had never heard of this service before and my friend recommended it. Hands down this is the only way i will ever do this again. The gratitude i have for Dr. Alex and her service cannot be understated. I was very moved by the experience. My kitty had zero stress; i placed her on my lap while i sat on the bed. Dr. Alex was so gentle and kind. I cannot praise enough. Thank you so much.

It was such a hard decision to let our beloved family member Titan go, but Dr. Kristin made sure we knew it was the best decision we could make so Titan was not suffering any longer. He lived a long life, almost 14 years for a 100 pound lab/terrier mix. I don’t think I could’ve made a better decision then calling Dr. Kristin.

> After making the difficult decision to help our elderly bulldog cross the rainbow bridge, we found CodaPet online, offering in-home euthanasia. Our dog was a large breed and could hardly walk, and I couldn’t bear the thought of transporting her to a cold clinic for her final moments with us. Dr. Michelli arrived at our home and was so kind and gentle with our sweet girl; she explained to us how things would work and gave us time to answer any questions. We were so thankful to be able to say our final goodbyes to our fur baby in the privacy of our home and with her in the comfort of her own bed. Our hearts are broken by the loss, but I couldn’t have wished for a better way to have gone about this experience. Thank you, Dr. M and CodaPet. 🙏🏻🌈

> On Sunday we made the appointment for Friday. Monday/Tuesday we noticed Tinkerbelle's condition seemed to be declining and asked Dr. Kemper if she could come sooner. She found (made) time on Wednesday for an earlier appointment and we really appreciated that. We liked her friendly professional approach, explaining the process and options in the details of how and where to perform the euthanasia. We think she carefully relieved any pain that Tinkerbelle had and gently put her to sleep. We liked that she wrapped Tinkerbelle up in a basket with her head exposed for final viewing and goodbye. Seem that our other cat misses Tinkerbelle too. Thank you.
