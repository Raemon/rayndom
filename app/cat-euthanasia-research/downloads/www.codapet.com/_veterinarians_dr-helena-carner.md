Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I have always been extremely passionate about animals. I was fortunate to have a wonderful mentor while in middle school that showed me how great the connection between pets, owners and their veterinarian could be. I had a lot of animals growing up and have even more these days! I have always had a mobile practice and enjoyed providing veterinary services to animal owners at their home. In my experience it was always so much less stress on the animal owner and the pet themselves for the euthanasia process to be performed at home. It is something that I have done since the very beginning of my practice but now I would like to make those services available to even more people.

> This is the first time we ever had to go through this and put a pet down. It was a wonderful, comforting option having it done in our home with our fur baby in our arms. Dr. Carner was calm and explained everything to us and eased out hearts. So happy we used her during this tough time.

> This is a copy/paste of the message I sent to our primary vet. I stand by it still. "On Fri, Aug 2, 2024 at 6:33 AM Jan Berte <legacygraphics@gmail.com> wrote: Shortly before 7 o'clock last night our sweet little Carter breathed his last here at home being held by his mom and dad and knowing nothing but love. I can't thank you enough for pointing us at codapet during this awful time. The vet, Dr. Carner, is a consummate professional and was nothing but gentle and loving with our boy and completely sensitive to our crushed hearts. It was as calm and peaceful as we could have wished for. Thank you again for helping take care of us and our babies. jan "

> It was very peaceful to have Dr. Carner come to the house. My poor girl, Miya, stressed out to the point of her head vibrating, on her previous visit to the vet. I didn't want her to get stressed out before we said our goodbyes. Her ashes were delivered back home. What a peaceful memories of losing my fur baby.
