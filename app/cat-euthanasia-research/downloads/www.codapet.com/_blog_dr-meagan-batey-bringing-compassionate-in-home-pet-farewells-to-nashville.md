When it comes to providing gentle, at-home pet euthanasia and cremation services in Nashville and the surrounding suburbs, Dr. Meagan Batey is a trusted source of comfort. With nearly a decade of veterinary experience and a heartfelt dedication shaped by her lifelong bond with animals, Dr. Batey offers a loving, peaceful goodbye for pets and pet families.

Let’s meet the caring veterinarian who’s making end-of-life moments easier across Middle Tennessee.

## **Nashville’s Humane At‑Home Veterinarian**

Dr. Batey is more than experienced—she deeply understands the emotional hardship owners face. Whether guiding a family through the decision, performing a serene in-home euthanasia, or arranging aftercare, her gentle presence offers reassurance at every stage. With her calm demeanor and empathetic approach, she genuinely brings comfort to families during their most difficult times.

## **A Lifelong Calling Rooted in Compassion**

“Being a veterinarian is something I’ve always wanted to do,” Dr. Batey shares. Her passion began at age 14 when she started working in a clinic—seeing firsthand how vets give a voice to those who cannot speak for themselves—and never looked back.

Raised on a small farm near Murfreesboro, she earned both her Bachelor’s and DVM degrees from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (2010 & 2015), and later completed a small-animal internship at Oklahoma State University in 2016. Today, she brings not only professional skill but also a genuine understanding of the human–animal bond to her practice.

Dr. Batey is also Fear Free® certified, reflecting her special interest in behavior, senior-care, and internal medicine—priorities that enhance both everyday and end-of-life care.

## **Tailored Services with Transparent Pricing**

Serving Nashville, Murfreesboro, Smyrna, and nearby communities, Dr. Batey brings nine years of experience and heartfelt professionalism to every visit. She specializes in in‑home euthanasia for dogs and cats, providing a calm and private environment for families.

### **What Pet Parents Are Saying**

Families across the Nashville area consistently praise Dr. Meagan Batey for her deeply compassionate and calming presence during some of their hardest moments. One pet parent shared that she made the process of saying goodbye to their 16-year-old Yorkie “as easy as possible,” describing her as “gentle and compassionate from beginning to end.” Another family emphasized how “we never felt rushed,” expressing how her patience allowed them to process their grief in their own time.

Many of the clients note her ability to put both pets and people at ease, often highlighting how she “explained every step of the process” and “treated our dog as if he were her own.” They were especially moved by how she honored their pets’ lives with such tenderness. For families facing an emotional decision, Dr. Batey offers not only expert care but also a kind and empathetic heart that truly makes a difference.

### **Here’s what she offers:**

  * **At‑home euthanasia** – Starting at **$350** , including a gentle pre-sedation and the procedure itself
  * **Pet cremation** – From **$150 to $400** , covering transport and private or communal cremation arrangements
  * **Keepsakes** – Clay paw prints, personalized wooden urns, and other memorial options starting at **$50**
  * **Quality of life consultations** – Virtual or in-person, starting at **$250** , to help families evaluate their pet’s well-being. She also requires just a 2‑hour notice for scheduling, striking a balance between flexibility and respect for other families' time.
