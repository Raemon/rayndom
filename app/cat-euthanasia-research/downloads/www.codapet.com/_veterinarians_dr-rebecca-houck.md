Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I decided I wanted to become a veterinarian after watching one carefully and methodically remove two dozen porcupine quills from the face of my family's Labrador when I was 8 years old. Early in general practice, I concluded that one of the greatest gifts we can offer our patients is peace in their passing. As the years went on, I realized doing so in the comfort and familiarity of the pet's home is yet another gift we can provide. And thus the desire to provide in-home euthanasia arose.

## What pet parents are saying

> We were so thankful to have Dr. Houck come to our home and help us to say goodbye to our beloved Jake. She was very kind, compassionate and we knew that Jake was comfortable. Dr. Houck explained what was happening every step of the way and her calming presence made this so much easier to cope with. She even offered a hug at the end. Highly recommend this service!

> Our in-home pet euthanasia experience occurred with Dr. Rebecca Houck on 3/3/25. Dr. Houck was in-home with us for an hour. She was gentle, compassionate, helpful, answered any and all questions, and departed as I had requested. The contacts we made to set up her visit were equally responsive, prompt, and efficient. I absolutely recommend Dr Rebecca Houck of CodaPet. (This is a recommendation for a specific vet who contracts her services to a national organization. She was the only vet available through Coda in our area and I can only speak to her skills and demeanor. I have no sense of the quality of other CodaPet vets.)

> We were greatly blessed to have Dr. Houck help our dearly loved Buster. She was an answer to prayer and came earlier than scheduled, due to his increase of pain. She was professional and compassionate and so very gentle in her demeanor and with our Buster. Though we miss our sweet baby boy more than words can describe, we are so thankful for his most peaceful passing. Thank you, Dr. Houck, from the bottom of our hearts. Virgil & Lisa

> I can’t say enough good things about Dr. Houck or Coda Pets. Recently, I had to make the heartbreaking decision to say goodbye to my beloved dog, Reese. Dr. Houck showed such compassion, patience, and empathy throughout the process. She took the time to explain everything clearly and made sure Reese was comfortable and peaceful in her final moments. What touched me most was how genuinely they cared—not just for Reese, but for me as well. Their gentle kindness and respect turned one of the hardest days of my life into one filled with love and gratitude. I’ll always be thankful for the dignified and tender way they helped Reese cross the rainbow bridge.

> OMG!!! Rebecca was a rock star!!! While the event was tragic to us, she made the experience so much better than having to take our beloved dog to the vet, which made her afraid any way. Having her at the house was so much better for our dog, and us. Will definitely use her again and recommend everyone needing her services call her!!!!

> Dr.Houck provided a very comforting and caring atmosphere for our beloved pet, Tara. We had Tara for 16 years since she was 2 weeks old. It was a difficult decision but her dementia and the inability to do all the wonderful daily activities of a dog’s life was becoming more of a struggle , it was time to say goodbye. I was able to hold her in my arms and let her know she was a very good girl as she took her last breath. I want to thank Dr. Houck for allowing Tara to pass peacefully and in my arms.

> Dr. Houck was so kind and compassionate when she came to our home. It's a wonderful service to have to be able to let your pet remain comfortable in their own home. Dr. Houck brought the sweetest basket to transport Gibson to the crematorium. I cannot thank her enough for helping Gibson to have a peaceful passing and took his medical concerns into consideration. Thank you, Dr. Houck.

> Dr. Rebecca Houck is amazing. She is calm and compassionate and helped us say goodbye to our 16 year old baby girl at home. I am so grateful I did not have to take her to the vet, as she would become very anxious on trips to the vet. This is an incredible service. Thank you Dr. Houck.

> Dr. Houck was very compassionate and made this decision so much easier. She answered any questions I had and fully explained the procedure. I am so thankful that I found them and let my boy cross to the rainbow 🌈 bridge in his own home and so peacefully. I would totally recommend In home euthanasia. I hope I never have to use this service again but I am sure I will use Codapet in the future for in home services. I can't thank Dr. Houck and Codapet enough for making this painful decision so easy to understand and so much less stress on Baxter and me. Tina Lang

> Using at home pet euthanasia, was the best decision I made. To have a pet pass in a home that he had so many memories and where so much love given made the experience peaceful for not only him but myself. I will recommend Dr Rebecca and this way to anyone who ask. I encourage anyone to use this service to help it be private and special moment between an owner and a pet. Travis and I will always have that moment and it’s all thanks to Dr Rebecca and this service.

> I am so thankful for Dr. Rebecca Houck's compassion, kindness, empathy, care, and concern. She was so patient with us and let us spend as much time as we needed in saying good-bye to our 16 1/2 year old and 14 1/2 year old fur kids. She was so good in explaining all the process and how things would go as we sent them across the Rainbow Bridge. Our hearts were and are broken, but she made a very sad and difficult experience so much more bearable. I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Rebecca Houck if you are needing in home euthanasia. I can't imagine saying good bye to beloved fur family members any other way. Thank you so much Dr. Houck.

> Dr Haick is the most compassionate person i have ever met. We had put two ten year old dogs pass away exactly two months apart, Dr Houck was helpful with both. We chose in house euthanasia once in an unexpected, emergency scenario and the second time as the end of a 5 month journey with an agressive cancer. For both dogs and for us, she went to the ends of the earth for our family. A heart wrenching time was handled with the utmost care, compassion and Dr Houk provides endless time and understanding. We couldnt have asked for a better end to our ten wonderful years with our belived dogs. We miss them every day. This is the way to do it if possible- in our home, calm and full of love. Dr Houk is amazing.
