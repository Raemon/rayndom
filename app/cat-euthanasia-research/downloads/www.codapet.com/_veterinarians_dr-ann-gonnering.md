Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

Growing up in the Chicago suburbs and earning my degrees from the University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana, I have always been surrounded by a deep love for animals. My childhood was filled with poems and diagrams centered around them, making it clear that veterinary medicine was my calling. After spending some time practicing in New Zealand, I experienced the profound impact of in-home euthanasia for the first time. The peaceful and intimate nature of that process resonated with me, and I knew I wanted to bring that comfort to pet parents back in the U.S. In-home euthanasia allows me to provide a compassionate farewell in a familiar environment, ensuring pets and their families can navigate this difficult time together. My own experiences with my cats, especially Archie, a survivor of FIP, have deepened my understanding of the emotional journey families face during end-of-life decisions. Each of my cats has a story, from the rescue of Elgin, found almost frozen on the side of the road, to Jasper, who traveled with us from New Zealand. These experiences drive my commitment to offering gentle and respectful care when it matters most. I believe that every pet deserves a peaceful end surrounded by their loved ones, and I strive to provide that for each family I serve. My passion for animals compels me to ensure that this final journey is handled with the utmost care and compassion.

> Dr Ann Gonnering could not have been more sympathetic and gentle during this painful process. It meant the world to us that she was patient enough to help us find peace, in our decision to end the suffering of our turning 13 years old golden retriever. She was unbelievably knowledgeable about everything that was likely going on with him. Her information of treatments informed us of how little time it would buy (with much of it being recovery) and the high risks of a surgical procedure. Thank you CodaPet with all of our hearts for supporting us in this time of need. Words can't truly express how much it meant to have our pet leave our lives in such a relaxed, comforting and quick way.

> While being heart wrenchingly painful due to our pet's passing, our in home pet euthanasia experience was all we could ask for. Peaceful, dignified and gentle. Our vet explained everything, step by step. We had choices as to how involved we wanted to be. She was very empathetic to our situation and helped make our cats passing painless and honorable, just as we had wanted and wished for. I highly recommend this service to pet owners.

> Dr. Gonnering was amazing. She was knowledgeable and calm, willing to walk us through the experience and what to expect. She gave us the needed privacy prior to the procedure, and was the epitome of professionalism throughout the entire process. I will remain forever grateful for her easing the passing of my family member, and the grace she demonstrated throughout. I have already reached out to the emergency vet office to add her as an option for in-home services, as I only found Coda Pet through google. Her ability to come to our residence on short notice, on a Saturday afternoon allowed our family a final day together. I cannot give adequate praise to her and her services. She was perfect, and I’m so thankful she was there.

> We decided to use Coda’s in home pet euthanasia when my precious dog’s lymphoma became resistant to treatment and he deteriorated. I cannot say enough about how much better this terrible day was made by doing it at home. My dog had been back and forth to the vet so many times in his last weeks, the thought of one last visit to the animal hospital was miserable. The vet who came to us was compassionate, patient, and thoughtful. Our appointment was as peaceful as I can imagine.

> I am so thankful for Dr. Ann Gonnering. She was able to help our family through one of the hardest days as we lost our cat Sir. Dr. Gonnering was kind enough to meet us exactly where we were, which was laying in bed surrounding sir. She sat on our bed and explained the procedure in detail, allowed for questions, and was patient. She was very calm and reassuring and allowed us to move at the pace we felt comfortable with. Sir passed very peacefully and with dignity and I will never be able to say thank you enough for that. I can’t imagine ever having to go through this at a vets office. Dr. Ann Gonnering was very communicative and kind throughout the whole process. All of the details were coordinated by them which helped make the process easier. The crematorium they used was incredible - a very loving family that runs the business. THANK YOU!

> Dr. Gonnering was very kind, and took time to explain everything to our family prior to the procedure. She was great with our other two dogs, who were busy trying to get into her medical bag to look for treats. When the time came, she treated our Rose with tenderness and dignity. It was a difficult day, but being able to let our girl pass at home, in her favorite spot and with her favorite people, made it feel a little less overwhelming.

> Lily was our first family dog and I never knew how much love our little pup would give us and how deeply & quickly she became a family member. It was the hardest thing in the world to see her go but so peaceful to say our goodbyes at home with her. Dr Ann was so compassionate as she explained the process and answered all our questions. She has a soft spoken, caring & calming demeanor which I believe Lily picked up on. Lily hadn’t moved from the floor all day but when Dr Ann sat near her, she got up, wobbled over to her & sat between her legs for the remainder of her time with us. I believe she knew Dr Ann was there to help her. Dr Ann was so respectful of our time with Lily. I would HIGHLY recommend Dr Ann. She brought peace to our breaking hearts.

> Dr Gonnering was an Angel in disguise. She made this heartbreaking decision much easier for me because of her sincere compassion and knowledge. After performing a thorough examination, she assured me that it was time for my Tinkerbelle to cross over the rainbow bridge. And that I was making the right decision. Dr Gonnering treated my Tinker with such gentle care to keep her comfortable. I felt I could hold her forever, there was no rush. Whenever I was ready to let her go. She helped prepare Tink for our transfer to the crematory. I will never forget the comfort Dr Gonnering brought to myself and my family during this very difficult time. I will never ever forget her.

She allowed us all the time we needed to say good bye to our loved pet, told us everything that was happening. She gave us the impression that she had all the time in the world for us. I was so impressed with Dr. Gonnering that I tried to find out if she worked at a local vet office for the new puppy we got after this. Sadly we could not find her online. Figured if she was that kind in death, she would be even better in life.
