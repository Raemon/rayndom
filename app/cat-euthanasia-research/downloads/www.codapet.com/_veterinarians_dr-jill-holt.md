Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I became a veterinarian because of my love of animals and science. Like most children I loved my pets, but it wasn't until I got a job at a local veterinary clinic in high school that I decided veterinary medicine would be my career path. I decided to begin providing in-home euthansia because I see a need for providing this service in a setting that is both private and more comfortable for the pet and the pet's family.
