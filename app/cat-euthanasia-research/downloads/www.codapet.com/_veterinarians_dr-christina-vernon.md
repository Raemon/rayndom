About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I have always had a strong love for animals, combined with a fascination for science and problem solving I knew becoming a Veterinarian was my calling. After serving countless pets over the years, my professional interest has evolved into a desire to provide a source of help in the times most pets and their owners need it the most. I strive to provide the most compassionate, peaceful, and stress-free experience possible. Having seen way too many pets suffer or experience stress in their last moments, my goal is to help provide relief while ensuring your pet experiences the utmost love and comfort as they pass in the comfort of their own home.

> Dr. Vernon is a caring and compassionate vet. She did everything to make our last time with our beloved cat as gentle and loving as possible. She came to our home which was far better than having to transport him to an office. He was in pain but loved the treats she gave before she administered the injection. We appreciated the care from start to finish. We couldn't have chosen a better person for this important job.

> It was such a difficult decision to put my baby to sleep. I knew I wanted to do it at home and not at the vet clinic. The clinic had a flyer on Codapet which was very helpful. Dr. Christina Vernon was the one who came out. She was in touch with me before she came, she took all the time I needed while she was here. She was very compassionate and caring for myself and my baby which I really appreciated as I was very emotional. When needed again, I will definitely call Codapet and Dr. Vernon. She was wonderful.

> Saying goodbye to our Gigie was one of our hardest decisions we had to make. We did not want to see her go. She brought a lot of love to us and lived like a queen. We scheduled and cancelled several times with Dr. Christina and she was always very understanding and took the time to talk with us about the decision we had to make. During the time we said our goodbyes she was so kind and caring and Gigie was at ease that she was in her home surrounded by the people that loved her. It has taken us a few weeks to be able to write this but felt that it was important to let everyone know how much we appreciate Dr. Christina and feel blessed to have her during that difficult period.

She provided such kind, compassionate care for my beloved pet and ensured my own comfort while I had to say goodbye. I was given a paw print that will serve as a memorial to Kitty. I appreciated Dr Christina’s calm demeanor and respectful handling of the situation, including how Kitty was transported after crossing the rainbow bridge. I will always recommend Dr Christina when I can; I couldn’t have asked for a better experience during such a difficult time.

She walked us thru the process of how everything was going to happen. She took care of my Capone and felt very secure with her handling him after his passing. She sent texts a couple days later checking in on me and my family and how we were doing as well as received a card in the mail. She brought his ashes home about a week later. In this very hard and sad time, I appreciate all the warm heartfelt support she provided.

> Dr. Christina Vernon provided an extraordinary service during one of the most difficult moments of my life. When it was time to say goodbye to my beloved Toby, her compassion, professionalism, and gentle approach turned a heartbreaking experience into one of peace and dignity. From the initial contact to her follow-up care, every interaction with Dr. Christina Vernon demonstrated her genuine understanding of the bond between pets and their families. She took the time to explain every step with kindness, allowing me to focus on my final moments with Toby. The environment she created was calm and respectful, ensuring Toby felt safe and loved to the very end. Her communication after the service has been just as thoughtful—answering questions, providing information, and supporting me through this transition. This level of care, coupled with her willingness to help in every way, speaks volumes about her dedication to her patients and their families. I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Christina Vernon to anyone seeking compassionate in-home veterinary care. Her service is a gift during the most vulnerable times, and I will always be grateful for the care she gave Toby and the support she offered me.

> Christina was amazing to say the least. She began by sitting down with Tazz and offering her treats to break Tazz’s nervousness with a stranger in her room. Christiana not only comforted Tazz, but us as well with her caring demeanor. She spoke softly and spent time with us …no hurry . Afterwards she wrapped Tazz in a blanket and carried her to her suv which had a nice bed to put her in. About a week later Christina personally brought Tess’s ashes to us. She also followed up with a very nice card. I would highly recommend her services if you looking for a top notch professional to handle your loved ones final minutes…thank you from the bottom of our hearts 💕

> Dr. Vernon was very caring in this difficult time, she took her time to explain the process and gave us time to spend with Armani and her last few moments w us. She kept in touch days after and was very kind when I would text her questions or concerns I had but didn't think of the day of. Armani is missed everyday but knowing she's in a better place thanks to CodaPet & Dr. Christina makes it a little easier day by day. R.I.H. Armani ❤️

> Dr. Christina is a God send in the center of such a sad time in our lives. She was extremely caring, patient and double checked we were absolutely sure this is what we wanted to do. She was so sweet to my fur baby in all her last moments. I know this is never a decision anyone wants to make, but if having to for the sake of your sweet fur babies I absolutely recommend Dr. Christina. We got a beautiful urn back of our baby and a keepsake of her paw that brought tears to my eyes the second I saw it.

> Dr. Christina was amazing throughout the process. She was very compassionate knowing how sad our family to say goodbye to our 16 year old Mini Schnauzer, Pepper. She explained everything and provided us the best care we could have asked for. We had an in-home pet euthanasia before by another vet, but it did not provide the extra care as we felt we received this time. Thank you for your kindness during this sad time.

> It was beyond heartbreaking for me to say goodbye to my forever friend, Lola. Even before Dr. Christina Vernon arrived at my door, she was in touch, letting me know she was on her way (and on time), which was so comforting. She is not only an excellent vet, she also is a very compassionate, gentle-mannered professional. She took all the time we needed, explaining very step of the way, ensuring both Lola's and my comfort. Her good nature and empathy were beyond impressive. I highly recommend Dr. Christina Vernon.

> Makes me wonder if one of reasons losing a furry family member is so different from the loss of a human member is the way we communicate. With animals, it's heavily emotion whether words or actions and with humans, it's logic, emotion, words and action making it a little easier (?) to communicate...Needless to say, just coming to the decision no words can describe what it takes. The word "euthanasia" has a heavy connotation and weight so instead, peaceful release in a safe space. The love of my life had been with me 19 years and coming to the decision to provide his release, well, nothing can describe that in words. Dr. Christina was kind, showed my baby respect and attempted to offer some solace. I was able to release my baby, in my arms, thanks to Dr. Christina.

> Dr Christine was amazing. This was a very last minute decision to have Hank transition was incredibly heavy on my heart but her confirmation made my decision feel much better. Her kindness and compassion is so evident when you first meet her. She truly wears her heart on her sleeves and has the utmost respect and best interest for those involved. I love that my boy Hank gave her kisses and showed him her his favorite game before he peacefully passed away in my arms. She braved the cold morning of being outside with with us and I am so thankful that she walked into our lives. Thank you Codapet for making this mindful decision happen with communication and Grace.

> Dr Christina was such a compassionate doctor. She could clearly see our baby girl Lyla was suffering and felt the pain we were experiencing. She made every step of the journey possible for us to endure. The after care we received was by far more then words could describe. When she brought our baby back home as we crumbled in tears she comforted us. We were so overwhelmed as we shared where we took her for a final rest. A place near and dear to our heart. She now overlooks Napa Vallet in Penngrove where she runs free with the cows, turkeys, deer and llamas. Out Lyla will be missed but she made our decision for home end of life bearable. Thank you from the bottom of our souls.

Our little dog was right there the whole time and let her smell and lay with her sister. I truly felt she understood what was happening, because it seemed her grieving process only lasted a few days. The packaging of everything bringing our baby home to rest was beautiful as well. I would highly recommend her if you find yourself in this situation. Thank you so much Dr Vernon.

> Our fifteen-year-old Aussie had lost the use of his rear legs and was confused and struggling. And as much as we hoped he would be okay on a gut level we knew it was his time. We had called five or six vets and all of them were overbooked and seemingly indifferent to what we were going through. They all referred us to emergency vet clinics that stated they had no appointment system and they would get to us when they could. Our boy deserved better. Admittedly, I had never heard of in home pet euthanasia but anything seemed like a better option than sitting in a cold, sterile examination room. Our boy hated going to the vet and I didn't want his last moments to be filled with fear. Using CodaPet's website I made a same-day appointment for that afternoon. Dr. Christina Vernon did an outstanding job of comforting us in the most troubling of circumstances. She was on-time, kind, compassionate, gentle, and understood what we were going through. She explained the process in depth and didn't proceed until we were ready. He died peacefully laying in his favorite spot with my wife and I comforting him. He was the most loving dog I've ever known and it was soooo important that his final moments reflected how much he was loved. Dr. Christine allowed that to happen. He had a peaceful, loving death. Thank you!!!! I wholeheartedly encourage anyone struggling with the end to consider Dr. Christina and CodaPet. We chose cremation and received his ashes back in a beautiful box with a fantastic paw print.

> My family and I had to make the hardest decision of a lifetime, not just for one but two fur babies at the same time, Daisy (15) and Guiness (14). As much as we wanted them to live for a thousand years, their health was declining rapidly. Dr Christina Veron was our earth angel and was there every step of the way! She was very patient and supportive and explained every step of the process to help our fur babies cross over the rainbow bridge. She is one of the most caring veterinarians we have ever met. We can't Thank Dr. Christina enough for everything. Our family may feel a little empty but we are at peace. Thank you for all the love and support at this difficult time.

> Dr Christine came into our lives on the 8th of August of this year. Our little girl Missy had declining for quite some time and for her well being we decided it was time for her to cross over to be wilth her brother Tater. She was 3 1/2 lbs of teacup Maltipoo love and had live a good life of 18 1/2 years. The call was made the clinic to have someone come to the house and be with Missy and help her on the journey she was taking. Dr. Christine arrived on Friday and sat with us and talked about what was going to happen and the process. She picked up Missy too let her know who was here as Missy was both blind and deaf. Missy was very calm and showed no signes of stress or aggitatlion. Dr Christine was so loving and caring when she administered the drugs and we knew Missy felt this. I have never met a veterinarian with such a caring and loving demeanor when she is doing her job. There is a special place for her. Charles L Croghan & Sandra J Treece
