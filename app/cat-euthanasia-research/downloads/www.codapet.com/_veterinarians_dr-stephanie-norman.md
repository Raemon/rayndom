Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

My desire to be a veterinarian dates back to my kindergarten days when I took care of orphaned wildlife. That love for animals has been unwavering ever since. I have even volunteered my veterinary services in international and national aid efforts to improve the lives of animals, people and the communities in which they live. One of those services is providing support for pets and their parents during end-of-life decisions. With my extensive experience, genuine concern for animals and their parents, and an unwavering commitment to providing the best veterinary care, you can trust that beloved pets will receive the utmost compassion and expertise under my care. Through offering in-home euthanasia, I will help ease the transition for both pets and their parents.

> Dr. Stephanie Norman was so caring and supportive. She made us comfortable with the process of having our cat (Toto) euthanized. We had him cremated and she delivered his ashes to us. She was very concerned for our surviving cat (Marvel) because had lost his lifelong relationship with his brother (littermate). She also recommended we take Marvel in as soon as possible for a health check due to his age. We took Marvel in. It hadn't quite been a year since his last vet visit. We caught a thyroid tumor early and were able to treat it early. He is doing great! We will bring him in for a follow up visit soon. Thank you Dr. Norman for helping us through a difficult time and for helping Marvel to live his longest and healthiest life possible❤️

> Dr. Norman was knowledgeable, considerate, and kind. I appreciate her calm demeanor, and compassion, during a heartbreaking decision. Puppy Monster was my baby doll. I was blessed to have him 16 years, and I miss him so very much. I have battled wondering if I betrayed him, but Dr. Norman gave me the wisdom, and comfort, to be able to get through those moments. I am so grateful that she was the Dr. that came to care for my baby. Thank you for what you do Dr. Norman.

> CodaPet and Dr. Stephanie Norman were instrumental in making the peaceful passing of my sweet Sammie an experience I could manage. When Dr. Norman arrived, she allowed Sammie and me the space to get situated for what was to happen in a time that worked for us. Dr. Norman was kind, ever so gentle, inquisitive about my sweet baby boy, and made me feel at ease with this difficult decision. Sammie was carried across the rainbow bridge gently and with such care, and I couldn't have imagined a better experience. I plan to call CodaPet and Dr. Norman again when I have to say goodbye to Sammie's older brother, as I know the experience will be a gentle and gracious one.

> Dr Norman was so very gentle, patient, calm and accommodating during this very difficult passage for my beloved companion cat of 16+ years. There simply is no easy or painless way through these times when our pets look to us to be brave and strong for them. But Dr Norman made it the best it could be. I'm very thankful she was available for us and walked this thorny path with us. Thank you, Codapet Team.

> It's difficult to find the right words to review a mobile euthanasia service but, here we are.. This was not our first time losing a pet and it unfortunately won't be our last. However, it was our first time using a mobile vet and I'm never going back. It was so much less stressful for my dog and honestly for us as well. Dr Stephanie was respectful, caring, and calm. She talked with us through the hard moments and had the gentleness and compassion of a saint. Saying goodbye is so hard but it's easier for your pet when you can do it from the comfort of your own home.

> Dr. Stephanie Norman was chosen by us, and we are so grateful for the care she provided during an incredibly difficult time. Being deeply bonded to our dog made this decision heartbreaking, but after his Cushing’s disease failed to respond to treatment and his condition declined rapidly, we knew humane end-of-life care was the kindest choice. When we realized how poorly he was doing and requested an earlier appointment, Dr. Norman came a day sooner without hesitation. From the moment she arrived, it was clear we had made the right choice. She was calm, compassionate, and genuinely concerned for our dog, taking time to meet him, comfort him, and gently explain what to expect throughout the process. Our dog remained peaceful and calm, which brought us great comfort even as we grieved saying goodbye. As painful as this experience was, we cannot say enough good things about the care Dr. Norman provided, and we would wholeheartedly recommend her to anyone who finds themselves in need of this service.

> In home pet euthanasia, This being my first time with my own pet, I was very apprehensive about going to a traditional vet for this experience. As weird as it is to say given the circumstances, I could not have asked for more when working with Dr. Stephanie. Her ability to be compassionate, empathetic, yet still professional was amazing. She walked me through the whole process, while giving me as much time as I needed to process all that was about to happen. She was able to relieve all of the self doubt I had about coming to the decision in the first place. Having helped other family members go through this in a standard veterinary clinic, I couldn't more strongly recommend doing this at home, in the comfort and familiarity of your place. Dr. Stephanie thank you so much for making a horrible circumstance as calm, peaceful, and timely as possible.

> Dr. Stephanie Norman was truly a gift from God. Our sweet little 16 year old bichon, Frosty, was such a joy to our family, however, he got to the place that he was suffering and we made the difficult decision to put him down. Dr. Stephanie was so sincere in her compassion and care for the situation, even going on the floor under our daughter's desk where Frosty was lying in his bed to deliver the euthanasia. Our dog couldn't have been in better hands and we couldn't have had a more respectful transition for our pooch to his new life in Heaven. (She even lovingly brought a basket and pillows from Home Goods that she placed our dog in as she took him with her.) Thank you again for such a wonderful, peaceful way for our pooch to go home.

It was very obvious that this isn’t just a job to her, and that she genuinely cares about you and your pet. She was so kind, patient, empathetic and considerate.

> I genuinely can’t imagine having gone through this experience without Dr Norman’s support and demeanor. She was incredibly respectful and compassionate , let us have space for grief, and also spoke to us through it in a way that was both informative and empathetic in a way that made me feel less dread during the entire process than I would have otherwise. Dr Norman took a very painful and slightly traumatic situation and made it feel like a funeral, celebrating the cat’s life with respect and love, vs. a clinical procedure. And yet she also explained every step of the way where my pet was along in the process. I know for certain she was not in pain during it. Thank you very much

> With very heavy heart I made an appointment with CodaPet (the only ones who had an appointment for the next day), and after I made the appointment with Dr. Stephanie Norman, she contacted me directly to let me know she will do anything she can if my dog declines fast overnight (my girl had lung cancer), and need her to come the previous night. She was very punctual, and so compassionate. Truly a person you like the first time you see. Very sweet, attentive, and so delicate with my girl. She was so caring, and kept checking on my girl until she was gone. She let me say goodbye as long as I needed, then the wrapped her so gently like you wrap a baby and we carried her to her car. It was like my girl was not even gone. I do not have enough words to express my gratitude for the way she helped me and my baby.

Even though she was working, she said she would come as soon as she could and she did. This was the hardest thing I have ever had to do and her patience and care for our family and especially for our Brodie helped us through this traumatic experience. I can't thank her enough for her kindness. Also, Jessica, whom I talked to on the phone was caring and compassionate, as well. I hope I never have to do this again, but if I do, I would definitely call Dr. Norman. Thank you.

There was quick availability and it was all scheduled online, we weren't up to making phone calls and explaining our situation so this was a HUGE relief. Once we scheduled Dr. Norman reached out to us within minutes offering flexibility to her services. She was able to come sooner than scheduled when his health got worse. She talked us through all the steps and was such a calming presence. Thankful we were able to have this level of care during such a dark time.

I purposely did not invite support people to the appointment. I thought I would be alone. What I found in Dr. Norman was a compassionate and generous professional who seemed to intuitively sense what I needed, and when I needed it, without knowing me at all. I am forever grateful for her stewardship.

> My little demon of 16 years had stage 4 kidney disease and so I knew it was a matter of time. Unfortunately, that time came crashing down faster than I thought when I had to make a midnight run to the ER vet. The vet told me Nox should be in their hospital with his elevated kidney values, but understood (& agreed) when I talked about euthanasia. I made an appt with Dr. Stephanie Norman and had her come out yesterday. I was very emotional and anxious, but she put me at ease quickly, and walked through everything that would happen and why. She was both professional and very caring during the whole process. I could have ended things that Saturday at the ER vet, but wanted Nox to be at home feeling safe when it happened. As painful as the situation was at the time (& still is), I'm glad I went that route.

> Dr. Norman was absolutely wonderful. She was very professional and compassionate when my family needed it most and it was easy to tell that she truly cared not only for her patient but also my family. I found myself in Kenmore, WA after losing both my parents in 2023 trying to clean out their house and manage their estate. We traveled from Phoenix and brought all of our animals with us since we were going to be gone so long. Our 16 year old cat had been having kidney issues for about a year and finally it came time to help her move on to the next life. Dr. Norman came out to the house and explained the process and then took great care to ensure my family was comfortable with the decision and then proceeded to gently do what was needed to end Cassie’s pain. On top of the loss, we were set to drive back to Phoenix in less than a week and the thought of not taking Cassie home with us was not something we could bear. Dr. Norman called her contacts at the cremation facility and made a request to have the cremation and return of Cassie’s ashes expedited so we could bring her home with us to lay her to rest at our home. She delivered on her promise and we received her remains a few days before we had to leave. Cassie is now resting peacefully with her sister Nala, thanks to Dr. Norman going above and beyond to take care of everything for us and make sure that my family had the opportunity to start the grieving process and bring our beloved Cassie home with us. I can’t thank Dr. Norman enough for all she did to give my family peace in what has been a very hard year for us. Thank you again!
