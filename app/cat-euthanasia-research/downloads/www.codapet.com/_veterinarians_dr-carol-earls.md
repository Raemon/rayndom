Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I first taught high school when I graduated from undergraduate school, and quickly learned that being on stage every day in front of 120 teenagers was not my ideal scenario. After some soul searching, I realized being a Veterinarian was what I always wanted to do (my Mom later found 3 x 5 cards with medical records that I kept on all my stuffed animals as a child). With a 3 year old daughter in tow, I went back to Vet school and have never looked back. Of course, love for the animals is the primary focus, but I also love the connections that I have made with the animals' human families over the years. I have enjoyed all aspects of my working career- preventative medicine, surgery, dentistry, as well as euthanasia. But with the veterinary industry as busy as it is right now, the stress of in-clinic euthanasia for the pets as well as their families has become so overwhelming that I now want to focus on making our pets' final times as stress free as possible.

## What pet parents are saying

> We had to let go of our baby girl, Zoe, on February 5th. It was heartbreaking, but it was the right time. Dr Carol was so empathetic and understanding during our outpouring tears. We decided to have her ashes returned to us. I’ll never forget Dr. Carol putting our beloved Zoe in her front seat with such care and saying she puts the little ones there. 💜

> The process in itself was very easy... She called beforehand to verify timing. Showed up and consulted. Was compassionate, caring and understanding. Respectful and patient. For as hard of a time this was for the kids, she made it as easy as you can in this kind of time. I appreciated her respect very much so and would do it this way going forward. Thank you again.

> Dr. Earls was an absolute angel. Her patience and quiet presence and strength was exactly what I didn’t know I needed when losing my shadow dog Lexie. I can’t say enough good things about her and can’t imagine letting a pet go any other way.

> Dr. Earls was amazing. She had great communication with us. Was very compassionate and professional. This was my first time saying goodbye to a pet. And she was very patient and kind throughout. I can't imagine saying goodbye to a pet any other way. Thanks. Steve and Lisa.

> We had a same day need and I was a wreck. Dr. Earls was fabulous. She spoke softly and warmly which brought much comfort. She explained the process and reminded us there was no need to rush, giving us plenty of time to give our Lilly lots of love in her final moments. I'm so appreciative.

> After a wonderful and too short 16 years, our darling little dog Lola let us know it was time for her to go. We chose home euthanasia in order to give her as peaceful a passing as possible. Dr Carol showered us with compassion and kindness. She arrived promptly on schedule, was professional yet unhurried, and very attentive to our needs. It's been almost 3 weeks since Lola left us and I'm only just now able to write this review. The package we received in picking up her ashes exceeded our expectation in its attention to detail. Giving us that last paw print on a plaque, which we didn't think about in the moment of grief, was so perfect. The loss of Lola has been so painful. However, because Dr Carol thought of everything that we couldn't in that moment, we are comforted in knowing that Lola went surrounded in love and care. Dr Carol is amazing. She cares about your animals AND you.

> Dr. Carol Earls made a really hard day a little bit easier. I booked this in the middle of a very rough night, she called me the next morning and was available quickly, which unfortunately was exactly what we needed. She was kind, compassionate, and listened patiently when I was not being logical. I could tell she cared about both my family and my dog, Boot. She did not rush us and offered to give us time alone. She wrapped Boot in a cozy blanket and let her sit in the front seat at the end. Seeing how much she cared made it easier to watch them drive away. I am really grateful for her help on this day and would highly recommend.

> Dr. Carol Earls was angel sent to ease us into the next chapter of life. After a year long battle with cancer, it was time. Our 8 year old chocolate Labrador, Doug, was our world along with his litter mate Dublin. Dr Earls was so compassionate, patient, and understanding even helping us understand Dublins needs during the transition. She took any doubt we had away, and was the best decision we could have made for our boy, and ourselves. She even traveled out of regular distance to help us. Thank you codapet and Dr. Earls for being there for us, I truly couldn’t imagine a better way for him

> Dr Earls was amazing. Fast to respond and was a true blessing for us. She was so good with our Cosmo and really made him feel comfortable. From start to finish she concentrated on Cosmo and us to make sure we all were good. She later sent us a beautiful “thinking of you” card and then later brought over a beautiful urn with his ashes and even a clay paw print. There was also a certificate and date of cremation. If you have to go through this I would recommend Dr. Carol Earls 100%. She is a wonderful caring person.

> Dr Carol was so patient and handled Sunnie with great respect and thoughtfulness. I would very much recommend reaching out to her if anyone is thinking about doing in home vs going to clinic. I am so glad I found this way and found her to handle this time of sadness. Thank you so so much Carole Tinsley

> We had an appointment scheduled for an upcoming Friday and we knew Tuesday morning we couldn't wait. Dr. Carol Earls came same day and was so kind and peaceful and caring. She was patient, calmly explained the process to us, answered our questions, and made sure we felt comfortable and not rushed. It was the first time we've used in-home euthanasia services and I honestly wouldn't do it any other way in the future. It was a far more peaceful experience for not just us but our Lilly girl too.
