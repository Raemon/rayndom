Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I have a life long love of animals, and decided to apply to veterinary school after working as a veterinary assistant. After completion of mobile clinical rotations my senior year of veterinary school, I felt that in home practice is the most compassionate way to practice and the least stressful for our patients and pet parents.

## What pet parents are saying

> Dr. Jennifer Holman is exactly the kind of person you want assisting you with your loved ones transition. She is gentle, open, peaceful, and caring. She goes with the energy of your pet, your home, your family, and you. She cares for your pets dignity and earns your trust instantly. I miss my Penny girl dearly and terribly, but Dr. Holman provided the best passing one could dream of. She made me comfortable with the hardest decision I’ll ever make, and she took her time with me and Penny as we said our goodbyes. This is a very delicate time, and you need a delicate person like Jennifer. May Penny rest in peace, and may God send Jennifer to every home that needs her. A lovely soul to send off my sweet Penny’s soul.

> Dr. Jennifer Holman was excellent with our sweet baby Seiko. It is heartbreaking that we had to say goodbye to our girl but Dr. Holman made the experience easier on us. She was so gentle with Seiko and explained everything she was going to do.

> I had to have my baby, Charlie, assisted across the rainbow bridge. Dr. Holman was a calming presence throughout the process. She explained everything beforehand and as she was performing each step. This was my first in home experience and I'll never go the office route again. Charlie was relaxed and loved at home til his last breath.

> All of my pets died at home. However, my fur baby was in so much pain I made the decision to euthanize him. It was extremely difficult and emotional. Dr. Holman’s professional, compassionate, and caring demeanor was above and beyond expectations. She was simply amazing. Thanks to Dr. Holman for making my first experience with this a little more bearable!!
