> I am forever grateful that my beloved pet was able to be at home during their last moments, and I thank Dr. Daniella for that. However, the experience ended up being more upsetting than needed. One of the silver linings in such an unfortunate situation is that my pet was outwardly still functioning. I’ve had pets in the past who lost abilities such as walking beforehand, and it makes the end of their lives even more heartbreaking. I was relieved to not endure that this time around, but when it came time to begin the end of life procedure, I instinctively reached for my pet. The doctor told me not to, and for some reason I listened. Instead, she gave the first injection while my pet wasn’t close to me. It worked quickly, and as my baby began walking towards me, their legs gave out. They could no longer move, and their head began to lower to the ground. My love was essentially “gone” by this point. So their last moments were of losing their ability to walk, then nodding off on the hardwood floor. The doctor then said “you can hold them now.” Again, they were already gone mentally by then. The second injection caused their heart to stop quickly, in less than a minute. I don’t want to come across as ungrateful, and ultimately it was up to me to do what I saw fit, but it’s still painful to remember my pets last moments. I replay their last day, and am able to hold on until I see them lose their mobility and sink to the floor. I wish I could change my reaction to the doctor in that moment. Please let people hold their babies if that’s what they choose, especially when their pet spent endless hours happily in their arms while living.

> When it became clear that our baby girl Chloe was approaching the end of her life, it was important to our family to find a way to ease her passing with dignity & compassion. Dr. Ross was capable, professional, and comforting beyond our expectations and I am so glad we were lucky enough to find a veterinarian like her. I highly recommend her services for anyone who finds themselves in this difficult situation. <3

> Codapet and Dr. Ross made this difficult time manageable and peaceful. Dr. Ross was very accommodating since the minute we connected. She was professional and knowledgeable! Made us feel confident in our decision. I’m thankful that this part of our pet’s transition was peaceful and the most comfortable. She walks us through each step while letting us take our time. She even chatted with us about our cat’s Coda’s beautiful coat and little bit of her life. The entire process was dignified, calm and peaceful. We are forever grateful.

> Dr. Daniella Ross met us on one of the worst days of our lives with empathy, compassion, and kindness. We said goodbye to our cat of 15 years and she walked us through each step of the process-including what and how long until we would receive his ashes. Everything was done with care and a lot of thought-from where he was placed to how he left our home. She even provided additional medical insight that helped us fully appreciate that we were indeed making the right choice for our guy. She listened to our stories about him and let us say goodbye how and when we wanted. The additional thoughtful touches-like leaving us with a sample of his hair, the delivery of his ashes, and a sympathy card was above and beyond my expectations. I cannot recommend this company and Dr. Daniella enough. Angels do exist-and her name is Daniella. Thank you Dr. Ross.

> Dr Daniella Ross helped me through an incredibly difficult time with a calm, serene energy that put myself and my beloved companion of thirteen years at complete ease. He went to sleep gently in my arms, and she gave me the space to say goodbye and the support I needed, when I needed it. If angels walk amongst us, Dr Ross is one of them.

> Dr. Ross was kind and compassionate when it was time for us to let our beloved cat, Luna, go. She examined Luna and confirmed that she was very ill, which helped my son and husband accept what we needed to do for Luna. Dr. Ross explained each step before and as she performed it, and she never hurried. Luna's passing was simple and peaceful. We couldn't have asked for a better vet to help Luna at the end.

> Dr. Ross was incredible assisting us in allowing our dear pet Sarabella to pass on to the other world. She was incredibly kind and compassionate, and took her time explaining the process, and allowed us to cry and grieve as we had to say goodbye. I cannot thank Dr. Ross for such a beautiful home experience and for being so professional and yet deeply human, loving and kind.

> There are times when you need a guide to help you through a new and difficult situation. Dr. Ross is that person. She arrived precisely on time, explained everything clearly and made us comfortable through the process. Afterwards she reached out to make sure we were doing okay. We would highly recommend Dr. Ross.

> Its been a little over a month since my boy passed. Dr. Daniella Ross assisted me in seeing him through. I couldn't have picked a better person. She was kind, and patient and respectful. I am not sure what I expected because Rocky was my first pet ever and I didnt know the process, but Dr. Ross walked me through it and made what would have been a difficult moment a little easier for me. Even how she transported him to the crematorium... in a cute basket, cozied in a little blanket. What surprised me in the best way, was that she sent me a sympathy card about a week later with a paw print she took of him... something I hadn't even thought of doing in the stressful last moments I had with him. Thank you Dr. Ross. Your kindness was godsend.

I have never received so much reassurance, transparency, and care from a vet and I trusted Dr. Ross to make his transition as peaceful as possible, which she did beyond my expectations. Thank you Dr. Ross for being who you are.

> It took me so long to even think about writing this review, let alone actually setting about doing it. It was the hardest decision I've had to make, one that has been fraught with 'what if's' and just wanting it to not have been true in the first place. Daniella, Dr. Ross, didn't make this experience somehow easier, there's no such thing, and she did help to just 'ease' things for me. She explained everything she was doing and what was happening at each step; it was agonizing and yet comforting to know what was happening to my best friend at her end. The kindness, the compassion in just letting me cry on her shoulder, the basket she brought along with the little blankie she used to wrap up my Momo; they all helped knowing she was so cared for by this stranger that helped her move on to the next place. I will always be grateful to Daniella and will call on her strength and kindness to help me again when the time comes.

> Dr. Daniella Ross helped us say goodbye to our boy Whiskey with an in home pet euthanasia on Saturday Sept 20th. My husband and I have never had to do the euthanasia route before so it was all very new to us. Dr Daniella Ross had the most calming voice and presence that truly kept us all at peace. She made sure we understood the whole process and even worked around us so we never had to leave our boy's side. She gave us as much time as we needed, and even gave Whiskey a silly little haircut so we could keep some of his fur. We are forever grateful. It was the hardest night of my entire life, but Dr Ross made it a bitter sweet beautiful goodbye.

> Thank you to Dr. Ross. Daniella was so empathetic and loving. She gave us all the time we needed with our little furry soul. It is perhaps one of the most difficult decisions ever to be made. It has been 2 weeks since Henry has passed over the rainbow bridge. We have been beside ourselves with grief but knowing he left this physical plane surrounded by love in the comfort of his home - I would not change it for anything. We miss him so much, but Daniella was able to help us through the moment. Highly recommend.
