Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

Early on, I had a tremendous fascination with animals of all kinds, I found comfort and compassion from them in times of need as a child and on into adulthood. In elementary school, I would be the first to take care of the class pet. There were many: anoles (lizards), hamsters, and guinea pigs to name a few. Science classes intrigued me and were where I excelled. My anatomy class in high school sealed the deal. Ultimately, I wanted to care for animals and challenge myself to solve medical problems. Over time, it progressed to caring for not only the animal but also for their human owners. I have always offered at-home euthanasia services, having performed them for my own personal pets, and I realized the more peaceful experience for all involved. The last several years I've provided oncology (cancer) services to clients and their pets. With this comes the knowledge that even with treatment, most cancers will be terminal, and providing in-home end-of-life service to the numerous pets I treated in this capacity reinforced firsthand how beneficial in-home euthanasia is to the pet and their family when it comes time, allowing for the most gentle and tranquil passing.

## What pet parents are saying

> I found CodaPet and Dr. Jenny Krueger when searching for in home pet euthanasia services for my 13 year old pup. Her health declined very rapidly and our regular vet did not have any available appointments. I was very lucky to come across Dr. Krueger's page that morning and get an appointment the same day in the afternoon. This was my first time having to go through this and she did her best to comfort us by asking stories about Izzy and letting us know what to expect with each step. We were able to make our girl comfortable in her favorite place in the house where she got a plate of canned cheese and hershey's kisses. She helped me get paw and nose prints with a kit I had bought earlier that week and she let us spend all the time we needed to say goodbye. Thank you again for taking care of Izzy and helping her rest peacefully surrounded by her family.

> Dr. Jenny Krueger works with compassion, care, and patience. She is there both for the pet (in my case a very beloved Corgi) and the human. Having needed to euthanize pets both at the vet and at home, being able to do this at home makes a terrible experience so much calmer. Setting everything up through the CodaPet interface was very easy and the fact that the portal gives you options about what kind of follow up you do or do not want was very respectful. I could not recommend Dr. Krueger more highly; her gentle care at such a wrenching time helped to confirm that we were making absolutely the right choice.

> There are no words to explain what Dr. Jenny Krueger did for us yesterday. Yesterday we sadly had to put down our 13 year old Flat Coated Retriever Louie. With our dog being 100+ lbs and having trouble standing due to hip dysplasia, we didnt know how we could ever get him to a vet. After coming across CodaPet, we are so grateful we got to do this process in Louies home where he was comfortable and familiar, and surrounded by his family. Dr.Krueger made whats supposed to be a traumatic experience, very peaceful and calm regardless of the circumstances. Louie got to lay exactly where he wanted and got to eat all the treats and spray can cheese hat Dr. Krueger provided for him to enjoy his last moments. Dr. Kruger explained every single step including what each anesthetic was named and the exact things it would do so we would understand the entire process. She asked us all our favorite memories and made the experience very special regardless of how hard it was. Louie passed very peacefully, not in a sterile unfamiliar office but comfortable in his own home, face first in a bowl of spray can cheese. We appreciate Dr. Kruegers empathy and patience for allowing us to spend as long as we needed with our Louie and feeling our pain with us. This is not just a job for her and no one is meant more to do this job then she is. Thank you Dr. Krueger for making this upsetting loss for us as peaceful, special, and informative as possible. We appreciate you more than you can ever know. From, Sami, Abbie, and Kim Solomon

> This service proved to be such a blessing. The only time our cat was in our car was when she was going to the vet. We knew it would stress her unnecessarily. Dr. Krueger was so kind, patient and efficient. She listened as we told our cat stories. We laughed and we cried, and when we were ready, our Cozy was allowed to gently drift away. I highly recommend at home euthanasia.

> We are so grateful to Dr. Krueger for helping us through one of the hardest decisions we’ve ever had to make. From the moment she arrived at our home, her compassion, professionalism, and kindness immediately put us at ease. She patiently walked us through every step of the process, explained everything in detail, and welcomed all of our questions. She gave us as much time as we needed—both before and after—to say our final goodbyes. While our hearts are broken to let our senior pup cross the rainbow bridge, we feel incredibly blessed to have had Dr. Krueger by our side. She ensured his last moments were filled with love, peace, and plenty of treats. We couldn’t have asked for a more caring or thoughtful veterinarian during such a difficult time.

> Dr. Krueger was excellent! She was nice and respectful. She asked about our girl, Daisy, and our life with her. She interacted with Daisy and was a calming influence. She answered all of our questions and walked us thru every step of the way. She gave us the space we needed to grieve as a family. Dr. Krueger helped make a very sad, emotional, devastating experience as calm, serene, and beautiful as possible. We cannot ever say enough about Dr. Krueger to do her justice.

> Dr. Krueger communicated with us the night before our appointment to make sure we were prepared and to address any concerns. We decided that our Louise needed pre-appointment meds to calm her before a “new” person came into our home. Despite lots of drugs, Louise was an enthusiastic host and greeted the dr. with wiggles and kisses. It was very difficult to get her calmed down and feeling at ease; Louise felt the vibe and was tuned-in 100%. - This was one of the hardest parts for me, I didn’t want her to feel afraid. - Dr. Krueger was patient and used a variety of tools and techniques to administer enough sedative to proceed. She took cues from us and understood that I, my husband, and my daughter needed different things. I needed to just feel my sadness openly. My husband needed someone to hear funny little stories. My daughter needed the security of knowing that another grownup had things under control. - Dr. Krueger delivered for each of us. I am so glad that we opted for in-home euthanasia. It was personalized to meet Louise’s needs, and ours as well. I am so grateful for people like Dr. Krueger, who do a very hard thing in the name of peace and comfort.
