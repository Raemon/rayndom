Dr. Struble was so kind. Our dog started to go downhill quickly and Dr. Struble came out earlier than scheduled. She talked us through each step, loved on our Daisy girl and allowed us time to say out goodbyes. She followed up afterwards to check on us.

## Pet euthanasia and cremation pricing in Newport News, VA

### Reservations and payments

Your credit card is required to reserve your appointment. However, no payment is required until the appointment and nothing is due until the appointment is completed

### Cancellation policy or pet passing

We charge cancellation fee of $100 if an appointment is cancelled less than 4 hours before the start time. If your pet passes away before your appointment you would not be charged a cancellation fee. If the vet you scheduled is able, and you would like their assistance with cremation, then pickup fee would apply instead of euthanasia fee

## Other Consideration

### Large Animals

If you have a larger pet, your vet may need the help of one friend or family member. Talk to your vet about options and limitations when they reach out to you prior to your appointment, and they will inform you of any extra cost for your situation. 

### How do I get my pet’s ashes

Options for your pets return home and memorabilia depend on your local provider. Your vet coordinate the return of your pet’s ashes and let you know if there are additional fees for urn delivery. 

### Special factors affecting price

Extra time or medications needed can affect the total price. Other factors can be if it is decided that it’s not time to euthanize your pet after the vet has arrive. In that case, only the travel fee, platform fee, and a quality of life consult would apply. 

## FAQs

### What’s included in the total cost?

The total cost includes the in-home pet euthanasia service fee, any travel fee (if any apply), and a platform fee. Additionally, depending on your choice, fees may apply for cremation services or keepsakes.

### Will the vet take my pet with them after the appointment?

During your appointment, your vet will confirm your aftercare selection with you. If you choose to arrange cremation services, your vet will oversee your pet’s transportation to a local facility for cremation. If your preferred cremation option includes the return of your pet’s ashes to you, your vet will discuss the process to reunite you with your pet's ashes and the anticipated time frame during your appointment

### Will the vet examine my pet once they get to my home?

Yes, upon arrival the veterinarian will assess your pet. This can look different than an “nose to tail” examination in a clinic setting and will focus more on the pet’s history and quality of life.

### What if I am not sure it is time?

It is not uncommon to have doubts about whether the time is right. If you’ve taken the Quality of Life Questionnaire and are still unsure, we recommend consulting with your family veterinarian before scheduling an appointment.  
  
Rest assured, if you book an appointment, your in-home euthanasia veterinarian will let you know if they do not believe that euthanasia is appropriate at this time.

### How long will the procedure take?

You can expect your veterinarian to be in your home from 20-60 minutes, depending on how much of that time you need or want throughout the process.

### What is at home pet euthanasia, and how does it work?

At home pet euthanasia allows your pet to pass away peacefully in the comfort of your home surrounded by love. A compassionate veterinarian will provide end-of-life care for your pet starting with an initial end-of-life exam followed by sedation to ensure your pet is comfortable. Your vet will always move at your pace so you have the time you need to say your goodbyes. Once you are ready, your vet will administer medication to help them gently and painlessly say goodbye surrounded by comfort and love.

### How do I tell if my pet is suffering?

Signs your pet may be suffering include chronic pain, difficulty breathing, loss of appetite, inability to stand or walk, or a loss of interest in daily activities. These symptoms could indicate a decline in their quality of life. You know your pet better than anyone, but speaking to a veterinarian can help you assess whether euthanasia is the most compassionate option. If you feel you need more help, you can read our guide on ‘[How will I know it’s time](https://www.codapet.com/how-will-i-know-when-its-time)’, take a [quality of life assessment](https://www.codapet.com/quality-of-life-scale), or call customer care at **833-263-2738**.

### What should I do if my pet is declining fast?

If your pet's health is declining rapidly, it’s crucial to take the following steps:

  * **Consult Your Veterinarian** : Schedule an appointment to discuss your observations and any scoring from a quality-of-life scale. This information can help guide the conversation about your pet's condition and options moving forward. Your vet may suggest palliative care, hospice, or, if necessary, euthanasia.  

  * **Ensure Comfort** : Create a quiet, cozy space with soft bedding and easy access to food, water, and a litter box (if applicable).  

  * **Minimize Stress** : Keep routines simple and familiar, and limit loud noises or disruptions.  

  * **Offer Gentle Care** : Provide soothing touch through gentle petting and offer favorite treats if they can still eat.  

  * **Consider At-Home Euthanasia** : If appropriate, discuss the option of at-home euthanasia with your vet for a peaceful and familiar passing.  

  * **Reach Out for Support** : It's okay to lean on loved ones, pet-loss support groups, or counselors to help navigate this difficult time.



  
If you're noticing signs of declining health, we encourage you to use our [quality of life scale ](https://www.codapet.com/quality-of-life-scale)assessment to evaluate your pet's condition before your vet visit.

### What is the difference between at home pet euthanasia and euthanasia at a vet clinic?

The key difference is the setting. At home euthanasia allows your pet to pass peacefully in the comfort of their familiar surroundings, reducing stress and anxiety. This option especially benefits pets who may feel scared or uncomfortable traveling to a clinic. It also offers your family a private, intimate experience during this emotional time. While some urgent situations don’t allow for time to schedule in-home euthanasia, many pet owners in Newport News choose in-home services for the peaceful atmosphere and compassionate care their pets receive right where they feel safest. You can [find flexible availability](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment) for our local vets here, or look for [same-day euthanasia](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request) appointments.

### Will my pet experience any pain during euthanasia?

No, pet euthanasia at home is designed to be completely painless. After an initial end-of-life assessment, your veterinarian will first administer a sedative to ensure your pet is relaxed and comfortable. The euthanasia medication then gently stops the heart without causing pain. The process is peaceful and allows your pet to pass without distress.

### What is the background of the local veterinarian?

Dr. Erin Struble’s journey into veterinary medicine began at 16 when her work at an animal rescue—and later as a veterinary assistant—solidified her calling to care for animals. Growing up as a Navy brat, Hampton Roads became her constant, and it’s where she’s proud to call home. After earning her veterinary degree from the Virginia Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine in 2016, Dr. Struble returned to the community she loves, dedicating the past seven years to caring for pets and their families.  


For Dr. Struble, providing in-home euthanasia is a deeply personal mission. She believes every pet deserves a peaceful passing in the comfort of their home, surrounded by love and familiar faces. Her own pets—three cats, Astrid, Wally, and Soufflé, and her loyal German shepherd, Hiccup—remind her daily of the unconditional love our furry companions bring into our lives. Dr. Struble feels honored to help families navigate these tender moments, ensuring their beloved pets are cherished to the very end.

### Is the cost of euthanasia for dogs and cats the same?

Most providers in Newport News charge a flat fee for euthanasia, although some providers do charge based on the size of your pet, so small dogs and cats can be the same price; however, medium or large-size dogs (such as Bulldogs, Australian Shepherds, Labradors, or German Shepherds) will likely carry a higher price. At CodaPet, most vets charge a flat fee for both dogs and cats; however, if there is a large pet fee, it will be applied automatically for you to review in the price estimate when you reserve an appointment. You can view the detailed [pricing and availability here](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment) or call us at **(833) 263 - 2738**.

### What should I expect during an in home pet euthanasia appointment?

During an in home euthanasia appointment, your veterinarian will make an assessment of your pet’s health and quality of life to provide guidance to ensure your decision is informed. The veterinarian will administer an initial sedative or anesthetic to help your pet relax and become pain-free, ensuring they are comfortable and at ease. In the last stage, your veterinarian will first ensure your pet is fully sedated before gently administering anesthesia which will quickly slow down your pet’s respiratory system until the heart finally stops beating. In most cases, this process takes less than a minute. Your veterinarian will always move at your pace so the process is as comfortable as possible for your pet and your family.

### How far in advance do I need to make an appointment?

The notice for every veterinarian differs, however, most veterinarians require at least a 2-hour notice from the time you need them to arrive at your home. This allows them time to prepare and ensure they can provide the highest level of care and compassion for your pet. It also accounts for their travel time, as your veterinarian may be traveling from many different locations around Newport News.

  
While you can request a [same-day and emergency services](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request), it's always best to contact us as early as possible to ensure availability and to give both you and your veterinarian time to prepare for this important moment.

### What should I expect in terms of my pet’s behavior during the pet euthanasia process?

During the euthanasia process, your pet will be gently guided to a state of peace and comfort. After a sedative is administered, you can expect them to become calm and relaxed, free from any pain or distress. When the final injection is given, your pet will slowly drift off into a deep sleep before passing away peacefully. Your compassionate veterinarian will ensure the process is as gentle and serene as possible, allowing you to be present with your beloved companion in their final moments of love and care.

### Can I be with my pet during the euthanasia process?

Yes, during the in home euthanasia process, you are encouraged to be with your pet throughout the entire process. Being there provides comfort and reassurance to your pet as they pass peacefully.

### How do I know when it’s time to consider euthanasia for my pet?

Every pet is different, and you know yours better than anyone, however, it may be time to consider euthanasia when you notice more ‘bad days than good’. It’s important to keep an eye on your pet’s quality of life and try to understand when it has declined, such as no longer enjoying activities or suffering from unmanageable pain. To help you understand their quality of life, you take a [Quality of Life Assessment](https://www.codapet.com/quality-of-life-scale), which helps you get a more clear picture of your pet’s well-being at this point in time.

Remember, if you are unsure, speaking with your primary care veterinarian can help better understand your pet’s quality of life. It’s important to speak with your primary care veterinarian if you haven’t yet to understand your pet’s health. If you do not have a primary care veterinarian, consider visiting an urgent care or emergency hospital in your area.

### How should I prepare my home for my pet’s euthanasia?

Everyone’s experience in saying goodbye to their beloved companion is different and very personal. It’s important to consider that you know your pet best. Some considerations, however, are choosing a comfortable space where your pet feels safe, sometimes their favorite spot in your home. Another consideration can be to gather any family members who wish to be present and feel free to bring your pet’s favorite blanket or toys, etc that make them feel comfortable. When your veterinarian arrives they will guide you through each step in the process and help you move at your pace to ensure the process is as peaceful as possible.

### How long does the euthanasia procedure typically take?

At home euthanasia procedures usually take about 10-15 minutes, however, the total time can vary depending on the pace you and your family prefer to move at and your pet’s comfort level. Your veterinarian will take the time necessary to ensure you feel you have enough time to be with your beloved pet while also ensuring your pet is calm and relaxed before proceeding. In some cases, this may take longer, especially if your pet is anxious or uncomfortable.  


We understand that saying goodbye is a deeply emotional experience, and we encourage families to take as much time as they need during the process. Our goal is to create a peaceful and compassionate environment for both you and your pet.

### What should I do after the euthanasia procedure is completed?

After the euthanasia, you are welcome to spend as much time as you need with your pet to say goodbye. If you’ve chosen any cremation services to handle your pet’s body, your veterinarian will reconfirm your choices and gently transport your pet when you are ready. If you’ve chosen any keepsakes offered by the crematorium, like Claw Paw Prints, Ink nose prints, or other memorabilia, your veterinarian will reconfirm your choices before leaving your home. If you have any questions or want to change your mind about any of your choices, you can discuss your options with your veterinarian before they leave your home.

### What are my options for cremation?

After the in home euthanasia procedure, your veterinarian will provide you with time to say goodbye to your pet. Once you're ready, they will re-confirm the preferred aftercare option that you choose when reserving your time with your veterinarian. In Newport News you can select three types of cremation services:  


  * **Individual Cremation (Ashes Returned)** : An individual cremation is a process where your pet will be cremated separated with physical barriers in the chamber. This ensures the separation with other pets in the chamber so you may reunite with your pet’s ashes. Your pet’s ashes will be returned to you in an urn of your choice. If you choose an additional urn then your pet’s ashes will be returned in the urn of your choice.  

  * **Communal Cremation (No Ashes Returned)** : A communal cremation is a process where your pet is cremated in a chamber with other pets. Once the process is complete, the crematorium will respectfully scatter your pet’s remains among other pets. It’s important to note, you pet’s ashes will not be returned to you.  




Some of our veterinarians offer an additional option known as **Private Cremation (Ashes Returned)**. In this option, only your pet is in the cremation chamber, ensuring that the recovered ashes are solely your pet's. These ashes can be returned in an urn of your choice, with additional urn options available. To see if private cremation is available with your provider, please refer to our [booking page](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment).  


**Note** : If you choose to leave your pet's body with your veterinarian, rest assured it will be handled with the utmost care, respect, and dignity. Your veterinarian will coordinate all aftercare arrangements as requested, allowing you to focus on yourself and your family after this difficult goodbye.

### Are there any low-cost or no-cost pet euthanasia solutions?

Saying goodbye to a beloved pet is never easy, and we understand that cost can be a concern for many pet parents. While we specialize in premium in-home euthanasia services, we also want to acknowledge that cost may be a concern. If you're looking for low-cost or no-cost pet euthanasia options in Newport News, consider reaching out to the following:

  * **Local Animal Shelters & Humane Societies** – Many provide low-cost or donation-based euthanasia services, often with cremation options.  

  * **Low-Cost Veterinary Clinics & Nonprofits** – Some vet clinics and nonprofits offer reduced-cost euthanasia, sometimes supported by grants or donations.  

  * **Animal Control Services** – In certain cases, local animal control agencies may offer euthanasia services for terminally ill or suffering pets at a lower cost.



**Note:** When considering a low-cost pet euthanasia option, it's important to call ahead to check availability, as some providers may require an appointment or have eligibility criteria, such as income-based assistance. Be sure to ask about additional costs, including cremation or aftercare services, which may not be included in the base price. Additionally, verify service details, as some options may have restrictions based on your pet’s size, health condition, or location.

While low-cost options are available, many pet parents choose in-home euthanasia to ensure a peaceful, stress-free farewell in the comfort of their home. If you're looking for a private, compassionate experience, we’re here to help.

> After making the difficult decision to help our elderly bulldog cross the rainbow bridge, we found CodaPet online, offering in-home euthanasia. Our dog was a large breed and could hardly walk, and I couldn’t bear the thought of transporting her to a cold clinic for her final moments with us. Dr. Michelli arrived at our home and was so kind and gentle with our sweet girl; she explained to us how things would work and gave us time to answer any questions. We were so thankful to be able to say our final goodbyes to our fur baby in the privacy of our home and with her in the comfort of her own bed. Our hearts are broken by the loss, but I couldn’t have wished for a better way to have gone about this experience. Thank you, Dr. M and CodaPet. 🙏🏻🌈

> Dr Struble provides an invaluable service to both out pets and to us their parents. My elderly large dog was in pain from advanced old age and arthiritis. She was able to stay in her familiar home and routine, and passed away peacefully in her favorite place, with our little cat Jack faithfully at her side the entire time. Erin is a patient and compassionate doctor. She took her time and allowed the process to proceed at its natural pace and when I was ready. I have 3 other elderly pets and hope their journey allows them to have the same stress free, comforting transition when the time comes.

I would highly recommend this service for anyone facing this difficult decision.

> We had to make the incredibly hard decision to put our cat down, and Dr. Diana was truly wonderful. She was kind, compassionate, and never rushed us. She gave us the time and space we needed and treated our cat with such care and dignity. I especially appreciated that she brought a basket to carry our cat after she had passed. It was a small detail, but it meant a lot during such an emotional moment. I am very grateful for her gentleness and professionalism.

> We were beyond blessed to have Dr. Erin Struble help our precious Mika transition peacefully across the rainbow bridge. I’ve had painful experiences in the past with saying goodbye to pets, and I was anxious about going through it again. Dr. Struble changed that for me. She walked us through every step with patience and clarity, making sure we understood and felt supported. She never rushed us, giving both Mika and us the time we needed. Most importantly, she ensured Mika felt no pain and left this world in the gentlest, most peaceful way imaginable. Dr. Struble’s kindness, compassion, and professionalism went beyond what I could have hoped for. She not only gave Mika dignity in her final moments but also helped heal some of the trauma I carried from previous goodbyes. That is a gift I’ll never forget. Mika crossed over so calmly, surrounded by love, and I can never thank Dr. Struble enough for the comfort she gave our family. She is truly an angel in this work, and I will recommend her to anyone who finds themselves facing this difficult time.

> Amazing. I went online in the morning at 6am and scheduled for 11am. They even have a link for more urgent response. Dr. Alex was incredibly compassionate and professional. I had never heard of this service before and my friend recommended it. Hands down this is the only way i will ever do this again. The gratitude i have for Dr. Alex and her service cannot be understated. I was very moved by the experience. My kitty had zero stress; i placed her on my lap while i sat on the bed. Dr. Alex was so gentle and kind. I cannot praise enough. Thank you so much.

> We are so grateful to Dr. Sarah Clem for the calm, loving presence she brought into our home during such a difficult time. From the moment she arrived, we felt respected—not only in our home, but throughout the entire process. I didn’t even realize in-home euthanasia was an option, and I can honestly say the experience was as peaceful and comforting as it could possibly be. Her compassion made an unbearable moment feel gentle and dignified. We will always be thankful.

> I have had loved and lost a lot of pets. This was the first time I used an at home vet. I couldn't have another traumatic experience embrazened in my memory. Both my cat and I loved Dr. Amanda. She is so kind and respectful and she values the love you two share. I highly suggest that if you are considering this option you let Dr. Amanda help you.

> Dr. Clark could not have been a more kind, compassionate and patient veterinarian. He’s also very experienced and made what I expected to be a traumatic experience (in home pet euthanasia) as peaceful as it could be and I will be forever grateful for that. I felt awful that I waited a day or two too long before making the decision, but having Dr. Clark be the one to help us was the right choice. We’ll now be taking our other dog to his practice for care.

> Using CodaPet was so easy; from searching for a vet near me to clear pricing. Once booked they remained in constant communication with me throughout the process, providing time updates, etc. Our family was matched with Dr.Kelsey Jones and I can not recommend her enough. She arrived promptly, listened to our concerns, examined our furbaby Ciddy and gave us ample time to grieve and make the final decision. At no moment did I feel pressured to rush. She gave us time to set up an area outside and spoke to us like a friend throughout the process, while treating all of us with respect and compassion. She even made a suggestion on how to allow our other dog to say goodbye (which I would never have thought of). It’s not an easy choice to let go of a beloved pet but i feel this was the best way to do it and highly recommend her services.

> We had a sudden need for home pet euthanasia for our beloved little dog, Jellybean. None of our local vets offered the service timely, so we had to try an unknown. I found CodaPet online and there were appointments available. Dr. Gordon at CodaPet was wonderful. The whole process went smoothly. Communication was thorough. She was a little late, but kept us updated (because you can't rush these things). She said all the right things and comforted us in our decision. We are heartbroken, but at least this part will be a good memory. Our pup was at home, peaceful, and not stressed out by being at the vet. We pet him, cried, told stories, and he just fell asleep. People who provide this service are special people. We SO appreciated being home for his final day. We would not hesitate to recommend Dr. Gordon if you unfortunately need this service.
