Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

After over 30 years of emergency veterinary medicine, I feel it is time for me to transition to another phase of pet care giving. Being able to humanely and lovingly let go of a beloved pet, when it is their time, especially in their home, is a gift.

> I’m truly grateful for CodaPet’s service in helping us schedule a qualified veterinarian on the same day. After assessing my cat’s quickly declining quality of life, being able to arrange a timely appointment was a bittersweet relief that ensured we didn’t prolong his suffering. Dr. April Le Blanc arrived on time and immediately put us at ease. She took the time to understand our cat’s condition, introduced herself to him gently, and answered all our questions with compassion. With over 30 years of veterinary experience—and as a parent to many of her own pets—her empathy and expertise were evident in every step of the process. Although saying goodbye to my dear cat was heart-wrenching, I’m grateful that his passing was peaceful and that I could be right beside him, doing everything I could to keep him at ease. Having the service done at home allowed our other cat to be present, which we hope helps her understand his passing. Dr. Le Blanc gave us all the time we needed afterward and offered heartfelt comfort during an incredibly difficult moment. I’m deeply thankful for her kindness and professionalism. I highly recommend Dr. April Le Blanc and CodaPet for anyone needing compassionate end of life care for their pet. She also followed up with grief-support resources, which I truly appreciate.

> April was patient, kind and very compassionate when she euthanized my cat Lilly. I was able to hold Lilly on my lap when she was put to sleep. April created a beautiful and peaceful, and calming atmosphere, and explained what she was doing every step of the way. Thank you April.

She really understands the grieving process and did everything possible to make for the most comfortable and nurturing goodbye possible. We really appreciate her great attention to detail every step along the way. She clearly has put in a lot of thought into making for a peaceful goodbye and taking all the best steps possible to help with the grieving process.

> Dr. Le Blanc was very kind and caring and immediately had a connection with our dog. She was responsive and communicated with us days ahead of our appointment. While in our home she thoroughly explained everything to us and answered all questions. Her love for animals and people is evident. Our dog was relaxed and passed peacefully. We were pleased she was there for us during a difficult time.

> We are extremely glad we choose to have April help us with this very sad moment for our family. She was able to provide the understanding, professionalism, and emotional support that we needed, helping us and our 10-year-old daughter to say goodbye to our elderly dog. In the time she was with us, April was present and open. She didn't treat us as clients; she treated us as new friends and that made all the difference. We recommend her without any hesitation.
