Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

As a veterinarian, I am passionate about alleviating suffering and believe that although saying goodbye to our furry companions is one of the hardest acts a pet parent goes through, it is also one of the greatest gifts we can give to our pets. During my first year out of vet school, I worked in a busy practice that awarded me the opportunity to provide in-home hospice care and euthanasia. I found these house calls very rewarding, knowing that the animal had passed peacefully in the comfort of their home, surrounded by their loved ones.

> On one of the hardest days I have had to experience as a pet parent, Dr Tovar was an immense help. She was kind and supportive, walked me through all the steps clearly. At each turn checked in with me and my family to make sure we were okay. Her loving approach made all the difference and we were able to say goodbye to our beloved Chicago in the comfort of our own home and give him the send off he so deserved after 12 years together. I wish all goodbyes could be done in such a loving comforting way.

> Dr. Tovar handled our beloved Brooklyn in a very professional way. Prepared us by explaining step by step of how the procedure would be. She sat with us as we shared stories among our family. She really made it peaceful and handled her with care. I would highly recommend her to anyone when it becomes time to lay your pet to rest. She is very caring!!
