When it comes to providing compassionate, at-home pet care in Algonquin and the surrounding Chicago suburbs, Dr. Cassandra Lewis is a name that pet families trust. With years of veterinary experience and a heartfelt approach shaped by her unique connection with her mule, Dr. Lewis offers a gentle, respectful way for pets and their families to say goodbye.

Let’s get to know the compassionate vet who brings kindness to homes across Northern Illinois.

## **Algonquin’s Compassionate At-Home Veterinarian**

Dr. Lewis isn’t just a skilled veterinarian; she’s someone who truly understands the emotional journey that pet owners face. Whether she’s making a house call to provide peaceful euthanasia or offering support during difficult times, her calm and caring presence helps families feel comforted every step of the way.

Her approach is rooted in years of hands-on experience, but it’s her personal story that truly sets her apart.

## **How a Mule and a Lifelong Dream Shaped Her Approach to Pet Care**

“I am that stereotypical person you hear about who’s always wanted to be a veterinarian since I can remember,” Dr. Lewis shares. Growing up, she loved caring for the many animals in her home—everything from cats and dogs to turtles, fish, horses, and guinea pigs. She calls her childhood household a “zoo,” but one filled with love and care for all creatures.

Her passion for veterinary medicine runs deep, especially for the senior pets at her practice. However, her journey toward providing euthanasia services began with a very personal experience involving a mule her family had for over 20 years.

That mule was her childhood companion—a sweet soul she grew up riding. When the mule was 36 years old, she likely developed a brain tumor and began acting wild and difficult to manage. With winter coming, Dr. Lewis’s parents worried about the risk of a traumatic injury on snow and ice and wanted to ensure their beloved mule had a peaceful ending.

A local vet initially attempted euthanasia but refused to continue after it went poorly and recommended a wildlife vet instead. The mule had been their “baby” for more than two decades, and Dr. Lewis felt she deserved a dignified, peaceful farewell.

Though eight months pregnant at the time, Dr. Lewis drove to Indiana to provide that compassionate ending herself. “It was truly rewarding for my family and me to know she passed without fear or pain, surrounded by love and treated with the gentle touch she deserved,” she recalls.

For Dr. Lewis, euthanasia is always a difficult choice, but she views it as the kindest gift we can give our pets. “Sometimes it’s one of the most rewarding parts of this profession—to take away pain and suffering for an animal that can’t understand what’s happening.”

## **Expert Care with a Personal Touch**

Dr. Lewis earned her veterinary degree with a focus on compassionate care and end-of-life services. Now serving families in Algonquin, Crystal Lake, Elgin, Schaumburg, and surrounding communities, she brings 19 years of experience to her work, specializing in in-home euthanasia for dogs and cats.

Here’s what she offers:

  * At-home euthanasia starting at $300, including pre-sedation to ease your pet’s transition
  * Private and communal cremation options with transportation included, priced between $150 and $375
  * Keepsakes to remember your beloved pet, from clay paw prints to custom urns



Her goal is to make a difficult time as peaceful and gentle as possible for both pets and their families.
