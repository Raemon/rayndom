Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

Like many before me, all I ever wanted was to be a Vet. I grew up with a Mum who rescued everything and was a wildlife carer, and we had the whole menagerie of creatures including joeys, lizards, all kinds of native birds, dogs, cats, and even 9 horses there at one stage! Loving of all these critters over the years, both as a kid and then with my own pets as an adult, inevitably also meant that at some stage the time to say goodbye would arrive. Even most recently, when my beloved old dog, Santa, reached the end stages of his terminal illness, I wanted him to go at home. When the day came, we were under the big tree in our yard, and he took his last breath looking at our beautiful mountains. A year or so later, when it was her time, my best friend Katy’s dog, Charlotte, was also laid to rest under those trees in our yard, looking at our mountains. Being able to reflect on this memory is such a blessing, and so, if they would like the option, when the time comes for their pets, I would like to be able to provide this final gift to the wonderful people of our Valley and surroundings, as well.

## What pet parents are saying

> ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Review for Dr. Beau Bradbeer Saying goodbye to our beloved dog, AVA, was one of the hardest moments of our lives. Dr. Beau Bradbeer guided us through that painful day with extraordinary compassion, gentleness, and respect. She treated AVA not just as a patient, but as family — ensuring her final moments were peaceful, dignified, and surrounded by love. What meant the most was the way Dr. Bradbeer cared for us as much as she cared for AVA. She explained each step with kindness, gave us space to grieve, and honored AVA’s life with tenderness. Her empathy turned an unbearable experience into one filled with grace, and we will always be grateful for the comfort she provided. If you are looking for a veterinarian who truly understands the sacred bond between people and their pets, Dr. Beau Bradbeer is someone who will walk with you through both joy and sorrow. She helped us give AVA the farewell she deserved, and for that, she will always hold a place in our hearts.
