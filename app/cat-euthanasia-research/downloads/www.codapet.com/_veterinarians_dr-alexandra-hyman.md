Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

Like many other veterinarians, I knew at the age of five that I wanted to become a vet. While in college my childhood dog, who had thankfully lived a long and happy life, became very ill and my family made the difficult decision to have him humanely euthanized. We were unfortunately unable to find an available in-home euthanasia veterinarian but were at least able to take him to a nearby clinic. While I am grateful we were accommodated, I was disappointed with how impersonal that experience was, considering the intense loss I was feeling at the time. I vowed then that when I eventually became a veterinarian I would strive to provide families and their pets with an experience I was unable to give my own dog – a peaceful passing in the comfort of the home.

## What pet parents are saying

> Dr Alex was so wonderful in our time of need. When it was time to euthanize our beloved elderly dog, we thought he had earned the right to have it done in his home, in a spot where he was comfortable, rather than taking him to a stressful vet office visit. He greeted Dr Alex warmly and seemed relaxed through the whole process. Dr Alex ensured that he had a peaceful passing and that we had as few concerns about the process as possible. It is hard to be without our dog, but we feel great about the decision to go with CodaPet.
