Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I am that stereotypical person you hear about that always wanted to be a veterinarian since I can remember. I loved helping take care of any of the sick pets in my home and we certainly had a zoo with anything from cats and dogs to turtles and fish, horses and guinea pigs and others when I was a kid. I love practicing veterinary medicine and do anything and everything I can for the seniors at Young at Heart. I began to consider euthanasia services after a personal experience with a mule my family had for over 20 years. I grew up riding her and she was the sweetest soul. When she was 36 years old she likely developed a brain tumor and was acting a bit wild and difficult to handle. With winter fast approaching my parents did not want to risk her having a traumatic injury from the snow and ice and not being able to give her a peaceful ending in that circumstance. They called a local vet who attempted to to perform the euthanasia but it went horribly and she ultimately refused to continue and recommended we have a wildlife vet dart her down. She had been our baby for over 20 years and I felt she deserved a peaceful and dignified ending to such a long wonderful life. Even though I was 8 months pregnant at the time, I drove down to Indiana and was able to offer her the ending she truly deserved. It was truly a rewarding feeling to myself and my family to know that she passed without fear or pain, surrounded by love and treated with the gentle touch she deserved. Although euthanasia is always a difficult decision, I've always viewed it as the kindest ending we can offer to our patients. and sometimes one of the most rewarding parts of the profession to be able to take away any pain or suffering for an animal that cannot understand what is happening.

## What pet parents are saying

> Dr. Lewis was truly sent by God to help my family let our sweet Ivy go. From the time we first chatted to the time she left our house, she was professional and caring, as if she was a longtime friend. You can see it in her face and feel it in her gentle manners that she loves her work and loves animals. If you are searching for that person to help you send your fur baby on to better places, I highly recommend Dr. Lewis. I am so thankful I found CodaPet and Dr. Lewis.

> After our senior cat suddenly became ill, we made the difficult decision to euthanize her. Dr. Cassandra came out to our house after our small children had gone to bed. She was so wonderful throughout the process, she reached out to me beforehand to see if I had an questions. When she arrived, she was so kind and compassionate, walking us through the process and re-affirming our decision was the right one to end the suffering for our cat. She took her time, explained everything she was doing and what we could expect as she gave the medications and allowed us time alone with our cat. She also wrapped our cat in a blanket and basket after the process was over. She was such a beacon of light through a dark period of grief. I can't say enough kind words about her and our experience with CodaPet.

> With a senior dog who had vision/hearing impairment and seemed to be easily stressed leaving the house I had been thinking about next steps, which came quicker than I had hoped. I inquired on Reddit for suggestions and came across Dr. Lewis details. Kudos to Dr. Lewis and the Codapet services for the ease in setting up an appointment online as I didn't think I'd be able to speak to someone on the phone. Dr. Lewis kept me informed of her arrival time and really took great care of Clyde and myself and walked me through the steps of the process. Her calm and gentleness made the transition easier and for this I will always be grateful. Clyde's ashes were returned to me and Dr. Lewis drove out to my home with his urn which was extremely thoughtful and kind. Thank you, Dr. Lewis and also to Codapet.

> During the worst time of my life, I could not have asked for a more compassionate, accommodating, and caring person to come to our home and help my Riley cross the rainbow bridge. Riley’s health declined very suddenly and quickly, sending my husband and I into a spiral, and while part of me wanted to do this with his regular vet, who has spent the last few years doing everything they could to make his life the best it could be, I could not imagine saying goodbye to my best friend of over 16 years in a clinic on a metal table. Finding Dr Lewis was truly the best decision we could have possibly made. She was very communicative from first contact, gave us all the time we needed before and after, and took such good care of my boy, including ensuring the engraving on his urn was perfect and hand delivering him back to us. I am truly grateful that I stumbled upon Dr Lewis in my search and cannot recommend her enough to anyone needing to make this gut-wrenching decision. She’s truly the best ❤️

> Dr. Cassandra reached out as soon as I signed up for our in home pet euthanasia. She was kind, understanding and really went above and beyond answering my questions and concerns. On the day of, she was compassionate, kind and so caring. It felt like I’d known her for years because we were so comfortable with her. She described everything, offered options, and when it happened it was so peaceful. My dog was very scared of vet hospitals, and being on her own bed, in my arms, made all the difference. I can’t say enough good things about what would become of the hardest days for any pet owner. Highly recommend!!

> Cassandra made a Very Unexpected and Sad Event as smooth as it could possibly be! From heartfelt conversations before, a gentle approach during and a skilled and caring departure, I wouldn't have done this any other way! Plus being done in the comfort of my home was just as easy for my girl Zeena! I would highly recommend Cassandra and her staff to anyone who knows the stress and grief this can cause! Even from the scheduling of this event, the staff was extremely courteous and you could tell they really cared!

> First and foremost, I’m sorry for the late review. Losing my best bud has been extremely hard on my family and I. He was my shadow and my best friend and I just miss him so much 😞. Because my Oddy meant so much to me I wanted the very best experience for him . I was a bit reluctant at first because I had never heard of codapet. I chose to take a risk and I am so glad I chose Dr Lewis. From the very moment she stepped into our home, she was very compassionate, understanding, and respectful. We explained that Oddy’s tumor had burst open that morning and we were having a difficult time getting him to walk, and eat, which he loved to do. She walked us through every step and let us have the time we needed to say our goodbyes. Although that night was one of the worst days of my life, I was extremely grateful to have had the opportunity to hold my boy, in the comfort of our own home, as he took his last breath. Dr Lewis, also was kind enough to gift my whole family these small recycled medication vials with hearts attached to them filled with our Oddy’s fur. I turned it into a necklace and believe it or not it has helped me tremendously with the healing process after the loss of my fur baby. The only thing I was disappointed about is that my Oden’s name was spelled “Odin” on all of the documents and keepsakes we received. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you Dr Lewis. The Diedrich Family

> Dr Cassandra was wonderful. It was so peaceful for our beloved Zeus in his own home with all of us. He was always extremely stressed when we would go to the vet and to have to remember his last day with us under that stress would be very hard. Sometimes its unavoidable I know. I am grateful we could do this for him. I have had other professionals in the past come, because we rescue senior dogs and unfortunately we need to see them thru their last days. Dr Cassandra was above others. She was so compassionate and understanding. And her schedule was flexible. I was having a hard time knowing and accepting the right time for this and she was very patient with us. I would use her again and highly recommend her. She does her best for both the owner and the loved pet.

> My experience with Dr. Cassandra Lewis went way beyond my expectations. I contacted CodaPet to find a vet that would perform in home pet euthanasia. Ivy, our 16 year old kitty had stopped eating and drinking and was telling us it was time for her to go. Her behaviors changed over the course of a few weeks. She became very snuggly and demanding attention at times, but she also hid and seemed disoriented. As much as my heart didn't want to make the call, I contacted CodaPet to set up an appointment. I had heard of this service before and I really wanted to find someone to come to our home because Ivy hated going to the vet. I didn't want that to be her last time with us. The woman I spoke to at CodaPet (don't have her name) was very kind and helpful. I received emails and texts prior to the day that explained the process, and was encouraged to reach out with any questions. They made sure I knew that I could also cancel the appointment if I changed my decision. Dr. Lewis is very compassionate and truly cares about people and their pets. She made the process as easy as it could be. She explained everything she was doing and made sure we were okay with everything that was happening. I chose to have Ivy on my lap where she was most comfortable. She was already very tired and had slept the entire day. Ivy was given one dose to relax her (like an anesthesia) and then after 10-15 or so, another dose to stop her heart. Just a few minutes after the second dose she was gone. I am so thankful I could have her on my lap to cuddle her and talk to her during the whole process. Dr. Lewis asked if we wanted a paw print and some fur to keep. We saved some fur and she put some in two small containers for us. We also had the option for Dr. Lewis to take Ivy with her for cremation but we opted to keep Ivy and take car of her ourselves. I highly recommend CodaPet and Dr. Lewis. I'd give her 50 stars if I could!

> Dr Cassandra was so knowledgeable, respectful, patient. We were able to schedule an in home euthanasia for our best boy Jimmy as his health slowly declined and she made it so he could pass peacefully in his home, comfortable and surrounded by love. She treated him with so much care (before and after he passed), let us take all the time we needed, answered or questions. It's so painful to lose him, but she made it as comfortable as it could be. The little jar with a snip of his fur, the paw imprints were such a nice touch. Thank you for doing the work you do, Dr. Cassandra - it's such a tough thing to do seeing people on their worst days, but you make it a little less hard.

> Dr Cassandra was so incredibly supportive and said all the right things to make saying goodbye to our dear Enzo a little easier. We knew it was time to say goodbye and knew that in home euthanasia was the way he deserved to go. He was at home on my lap, not in a scary clinical place with strangers and strange animals. This was the last gift we could give him. Dignity, peace, and comfort in return for 19 wonderful years. You can trust that Dr Cassandra will make your pet comfortable and at ease during the entire process.

> Dr. Cassandra Lewis was so kind during the entire process. Even before the appointment we were able to text her to ask questions and get reassurance that we were making the right choice at the right time. I’m so grateful we were able to give our fur baby, Callie, the peaceful and calm last moments she deserved. It’s never easy, but being able to be home, holding her, snuggling in her favorite spot certainly helped. Our other dog was able to be there as well, which I think helped him understand. I’m so grateful for Dr. Cassandra and although I hope you don’t ever need her - if you do find yourself in this situation, I would highly recommend her and doing it in-home as opposed to in a vet’s office.

> I can not say enough good things about CodaPet and Dr. Lewis. On-line scheduling was quick and easy we got an appointment same day (I requested the appointmentaround 1am and Dr. Lewis arrivedaround 6pm). With our dogs rapid decline it was absolutely necessary for her comfort as well as it was very important to us she could pass at home as we did not want her to have to go through the added stress of a trip to the vet in her last moments. Dr. Lewis was amazing to work with. She kept in contact and updated us throughout the day on ETA as well as general checking in to see how out Cassie was doing. During our appointment Dr. Lewis was kind and compassionate, she talked us through the process as well as gave us all the time we needed with Cassie. Having Cassie at home in her final moments was the best decision for our family, allowing the kids and other pets to say their good byes in the comfort of our own home was very healing and we couldn't have asked for a better experience on one of the worst days of a pet parents life.
