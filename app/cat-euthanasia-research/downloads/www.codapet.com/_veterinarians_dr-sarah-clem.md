Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I value not only the time spent with the furry members of pet families but just as much those who provide their love and care. I have recognized over my years in private practice just how important not only the first day we have with our pets is, but also the last. I desire to help make the goodbyes as comfortable and peaceful as possible.

> It was Dr. Sarah Clem coming into our home, letting me provide the last loving thing I could do for my little Peanut Buddy. She understood the moments belonged to Buddy and me. She provided a gentle loving hand to both of us throughout. Nothing takes away the pain of saying a last goodbye. The hollow in the house now is wrenching. Utterly. But having those final moments in the comfort and privacy of home allowed the experience to be completely personal to our life together.

> Dr. Sarah Clem , made a painful event so much more easier , that I had to leave a second review. Dr. Clem’s warm personality, along with her compassion and professionalism exceeded our expectations. We couldn’t be any more grateful for how something that’s so difficult, left us feeling so peaceful , in her care . Not to mention the wonderful paw print photo frame she gifted with her service . Also would like to mention the quality of the cedar urn locking box and paw print we ordered with cremation was excellent. And to our surprise the wonderful card and cremation stones included were a heartfelt surprise . Thank You again , Dr.Clem !!!

> We recently had to make the incredibly difficult decision to say goodbye to our beloved pet Nugget and I can’t express enough how grateful we are for Dr. Clem. From start to finish, she made the process as peaceful and comfortable as it could possibly be and my heart is filled with joy that we were able to do this as our last gift for my sweet girl. Dr. Clem was incredibly kind, empathetic, patient and took the time to answer all of our questions and ease our concerns. She gave us space to process the decision, but also offered guidance with such gentle understanding. The at-home euthanasia service was a blessing and really the best decision we could have made. It allowed our pet to be in their own familiar space, in her own bed, surrounded by pure love. Dr. Clem truly has a gift for this delicate work and she made a difficult day much easier to bear. If you are facing the tough choice of euthanasia for your pet, I highly recommend Dr. Clem for in home euthanasia not only for her expert care and deep empathy, but above all, her understanding of how to make such a painful experience as loving and peaceful as possible. Dr. Clem even returned my sweet Nugget in a urn, engraved with her name. I really cannot emphasize enough how much this process helped me accept Nugget’s transition home with such peace. If you are on the fence about having Dr. Clem do an in home euthanasia, this is your sign not to be! Thank you Dr. Clem and Codapet for everything. You’ve left an everlasting mark on our hearts and we will never be able to thank you enough - The Carlson’s

> My experience with Code A Pet started at a vet appointment with a very compassionate vet who recommended Code A Pet should I need them over a weekend. My call for an appointment was full of understanding about losing a pet. Dr. Sarah Clem came to my house to put down my 15 year rescue dog. My dog use to get overwhelmed when going to a vet, by having Dr. Clem come to my house she was able to stay calm. Dr. Clem was very empathetic, explaining everything she did. I would highly recommend this service and have to my friends.

> I can't thank Dr. Sarah Clem enough for helping us with our beautiful Miss Bo...giving us the blessing of having her pass peacefully at home with our family around her. Miss Bo was a 14 year old pit bull mix and had been having trouble walking around for the last 6 months as her back legs were giving out to the point where she was dragging herself around. We were pleased to find Codapet when we asked our veterinary office, All Creatures if they provided in home euthanasia services and they provided us with Codapet's contact info. We were also pleased to see that Dr. Sarah Clem was available as she is also a Vet at All Creatures. Codapet's website was so helpful and their online scheduling made the whole experience very easy to setup and schedule payment and cremation services. Dr. Sarah gave us as much time with Miss Bo as we needed the morning she passed...and although it was hard letting her go, the way she passed in her bed with us all around her was the way it should be. She had a beautiful life and she passed peacefully which allowed us to manage getting back to our daily lives without her more easily. I can't recommend Codapet and Dr. Sarah Clem enough. We will be using them for all our future pets.

> It was tough making this decision and putting my cat to rest after her lymphoma diagnosis, I miss her greatly. I was tired of vet visits, Autumn was as well, she wasn't going to get better. I'm happy this service exists and that Autumn's last day wasn't spent waiting in a cage at the vet to be put to sleep. She would have been stressed. We had her resting in the bed all day, her favorite spot, and she received tons of love from the family leading up to the appointment. Dr. Sarah Clem was incredible. She was in contact with us in the day leading up to the appointment, answered our questions and was friendly and compassionate. She was very kind and I'm thankful for her. This was very hard for my family and I and she was just excellent. I cannot really express it properly how thankful I am. Thank you Dr. Sarah!

She came to our home and explained the process to us and patiently answered our questions. She asked us about Gracie's story and how she came into our lives.

> There’s not much else harder than seeing your pet family member fall ill and in no time to begin to greatly suffer-with no hope of recovery. I loved her too much to see the joy sucked out of her and allow her suffer. Dr. Sarah texted on her way and when she arrived. This helped me to prepare in slow steps. She informed me of the procedures and waited patiently until I was ready. She helped me to understand all the steps Lexie would go through and left me with her to cry and rock Lexie in my arms as my music list played softly. Dr. Sarah made a beautiful paw print as a keepsake and gently played her in a basket with a blanket played over her body as though she were sleeping. I got another look at Lexie’s sweet face one last time as they left. Thank you, Dr. Sarah for taking care of not Lexie and me. Thank you for the beautiful and comforting prayer also. You are a treasure.

Coda-and Dr. Sarah Clem were able to come to our house on a Sunday and euthanize her in a peaceful, loving environment. The end of a beloved pet’s life is always heart-wrenching, but providing a peaceful passing felt like our last gift to her. We will use their services again, if needed, for our other pets and would highly recommend.

> The hardest decision of our lives was to put our beloved 14 year old fur baby down. He was so special but I know he was in pain and his body was failing him (even though his spirit never did). I’m so grateful that Dr Clem was there to assist him in crossing the rainbow bridge. She answered all of our questions, was very thorough in explaining the process, and ensured that his passage was peaceful. While we miss him every day, I am thankful that the option to be with him in a comfortable place until the very end is possible, and that Dr Sarah Clem was the one to help him transition. Thank you Dr Sarah from the bottom of our hearts for all you did for us and especially for Lobo.

> Dr. Clem, her gentle touch, compassionate disposition and empathy were a blessing. Unfortunately, we had to make the incredibly difficult decision to put our sweet little Roycella to sleep after a long debilitating illness. As of late our pup had been starting to spend too many bummer days and we didn’t want to put her through anymore. It was a gift to our Roycella to be able to do this at home. Roy left the world eating short ribs, showered in affection and enjoying her favorite spot in her backyard! Dr. Clem took a sad experience and demonstrated the love and affection we had for our little Roycellita. Our little girl was relaxed, comfortable and content as we said goodbye and told her how much we loved her. Thank you, Dr. Clem, and may God bless you for doing what you do. You were amazing and we cannot say enough about you and the comfort and closure you visit gave us.

> I was in that horrible position of determining if it was time to euthanize one of my heart dogs that was 17 years old. I made an online appointment choosing Dr. Clem based on her profile. I was so blessed by choosing her. She was calm, quiet and communicated easily. There were 5 other dogs, my mother and my spouse present and she handled this with grace and compassion. I can not explain in words how phenomenal Dr. Clem was and when I was ready she sedated my baby Jr Onion and as I held him in my arms and whispered in his ear how much I loved him, she gave the euthanasia solution. It was a peaceful passing and I will never forget her compassion. Thank you Dr Clem.

> This was by far the hardest day I have gone through. From the second I held my dog when she was 7 weeks old I feared the day I would not be able to hold her again. The day did come though. Cyy, my beautiful female pit bull was not very fond of the vet and would always jump on me to "protect" her. I knew that when the day came that my best friend would take her last breath I couldn't do it at a vet clinic. Luckily her vet Dr. informed me about Codapet. Dr. Clem came in with great energy and complimented how beautiful Cyy was. Cyy, was big on compliments so I am sure she loved it. The process was very quick, but most importantly it was so relaxing. Cyy was so comfortable and so ready for her next chapter. Dr. Clem was prepared for everything and very informative. I am beyond happy I was able to give my best friend the "see you again in another life" that she deserved. If anyone is thinking about at home euthanasia please do it. Even though it may be pricier it is worth every penny and most importantly our pets deserve the tranquility. Thank you Dr. Clem, the service you provide is wonderful.

> Dr. Clem was kind, compassionate, and patient, as we had to euthanize both of our dogs. It was hard letting them go, but it was peaceful and they were at home. They weren’t scared or anxious, like they would have been if they were in a veterinarian’s office. I am thankful for what Dr. Clem allowed us to have with our two dogs.

> Dr. Clem was very professional and at the time very empathetic: She took the time to explain my questions. And I thought it was very kind and caring that she asked me questions about how Ginny and I became best friends. I appreciate Dr. Clem‘s calming nature. And I also appreciate the fact that she didn’t rush things. In conclusion, I would rate Dr. Clem with an A+++

> I’m so thankful that Dr. Clem was available to help our sweet Baylee cross that rainbow bridge. She was kind and gentle, and she explained the process to my family at each step. She didn’t rush us and gave us all the time we needed to say goodbye. She made sure that Baylee and our family were comfortable throughout. Thank you, Dr. Clem, for your kindness and compassion. My family and I, and I’m sure Baylee, were thankful to have you through this difficult time.

> Dr Sarah was incredibly compassionate and tender with our 20+ year old cat, Meadow. This was our second time with at-home pet euthanasia. The experience was very peaceful for Meadow; she was home and on her favorite couch blanket in her final moments, surrounded by love and care. Dr Sarah took the time to ask about Meadow's story, how long we had her, and really connect with us before helping us say goodbye. We'll call CodaPet when our next senior is ready to cross the rainbow bridge.

> It was very difficult for me finally to decide that the time had come to release my sweet Loki from my life and his suffering. Having Dr. Clem euthanize him in his own home was my first experience with in-home euthanasia; however, I will never euthanize another pet in a veterinary clinic again unless the pet's condition is so dire at that moment as to give me no other choice. Dr. Clem was very calm and compassionate from the moment she arrived until the moment she left, and the whole experience for Loki (and me) was as gentle as it possibly could have been.

> Dr. Sara was wonderful. She was very kind and thoughtful, explaining the process with my daughter and I thoroughly. She was not rushed and allowed us to spend time with Buster prior to the procedure. Using CodaPet was the best decision. We were able to sit with Buster on the couch where he spent many hours cuddling with me ever since he became elderly and less mobile. It eased our minds that he was at home with us and comfortable when he passed. Thank you Dr. Sarah!

> Our hearts were broken when our Gracie left us too soon. Gracie was so sick but managed to get up to greet Dr. Sarah Clem when she arrived to help us. Sarah just sat down immediately with Gracie to love and comfort her. Dr Clem knew exactly what to do to help little Gracie in every moment and each step of the gentle way. Her love and passion for animals is amazing and that includes her involvement with Gracie's Human's. Dr Clem is so kind and passionate. When we knew our beloved Jack Russell would not recover from her illness, Dr Clem showed such compassion during our painful decision. She communicated throughout the whole ordeal including our final goodbye. Gracie left us with such a sweet, gently and loving goodbye with the help of Dr. Clem. Sarah, Thank you.
