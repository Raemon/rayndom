Dr. Sara recently helped us say goodbye to our sweet girl cat. It was such a hard time for us and she was very mindful of that. We are grateful to have done this at home and the service she provides is beyond appreciated. The compassion and empathy she shows means a lot. The Cremation company used was great and respectful. Chloe was home within 8 days. We highly recommend this company and Dr.Sara.

## Pet euthanasia and cremation pricing in Littleton, CO

### Reservations and payments

### Cancellation policy or pet passing

We charge cancellation fee of $100 if an appointment is cancelled less than 4 hours before the start time. If your pet passes away before your appointment you would not be charged a cancellation fee. If the vet you scheduled is able, and you would like their assistance with cremation, then pickup fee would apply instead of euthanasia fee

## Other Consideration

### Large Animals

If you have a larger pet, your vet may need the help of one friend or family member. Talk to your vet about options and limitations when they reach out to you prior to your appointment, and they will inform you of any extra cost for your situation. 

### How do I get my pet’s ashes

Options for your pets return home and memorabilia depend on your local provider. Your vet coordinate the return of your pet’s ashes and let you know if there are additional fees for urn delivery. 

### Special factors affecting price

Extra time or medications needed can affect the total price. Other factors can be if it is decided that it’s not time to euthanize your pet after the vet has arrive. In that case, only the travel fee, platform fee, and a quality of life consult would apply. 

## FAQs

### What’s included in the total cost?

The total cost includes the in-home pet euthanasia service fee, any travel fee (if any apply), and a platform fee. Additionally, depending on your choice, fees may apply for cremation services or keepsakes.

### Will the vet take my pet with them after the appointment?

During your appointment, your vet will confirm your aftercare selection with you. If you choose to arrange cremation services, your vet will oversee your pet’s transportation to a local facility for cremation. If your preferred cremation option includes the return of your pet’s ashes to you, your vet will discuss the process to reunite you with your pet's ashes and the anticipated time frame during your appointment

### Will the vet examine my pet once they get to my home?

Yes, upon arrival the veterinarian will assess your pet. This can look different than an “nose to tail” examination in a clinic setting and will focus more on the pet’s history and quality of life.

### What if I am not sure it is time?

It is not uncommon to have doubts about whether the time is right. If you’ve taken the Quality of Life Questionnaire and are still unsure, we recommend consulting with your family veterinarian before scheduling an appointment.  
  
Rest assured, if you book an appointment, your in-home euthanasia veterinarian will let you know if they do not believe that euthanasia is appropriate at this time.

### How long will the procedure take?

You can expect your veterinarian to be in your home from 20-60 minutes, depending on how much of that time you need or want throughout the process.

### What is in-home pet euthanasia, and how does it work?

**In-home pet euthanasia** allows your pet to pass away peacefully in the comfort of your home, surrounded by love. A compassionate veterinarian will provide end-of-life care for your pet, starting with an initial end-of-life exam followed by sedation to ensure your pet is comfortable. Your vet will always move at your pace, so you have the time you need to say your goodbyes. Once you are ready, your vet will administer medication to help them gently and painlessly say goodbye, surrounded by comfort and love.

### How do I tell if my pet is suffering?

Signs your pet may be suffering include chronic pain, difficulty breathing, loss of appetite, inability to stand or walk, or a loss of interest in daily activities. These symptoms could indicate a decline in their quality of life. You know your pet better than anyone, but speaking to a veterinarian can help you assess whether euthanasia is the most compassionate option. If you feel you need more help, you can read our guide on ‘[How will I know it’s time](https://www.codapet.com/how-will-i-know-when-its-time)’, take a [quality of life assessment](https://www.codapet.com/quality-of-life-scale), or call customer care at 833-263-2738.

### What should I do if my pet is declining fast?

If your pet's health is declining rapidly, it’s crucial to take the following steps:

  * **Consult Your Veterinarian:** Schedule an appointment to discuss your observations and any scoring from a quality-of-life scale. This information can help guide the conversation about your pet's condition and options moving forward. Your vet may suggest palliative care, hospice, or, if necessary, euthanasia.  

  * **Ensure Comfort:** Create a quiet, cozy space with soft bedding and easy access to food, water, and a litter box (if applicable).  

  * **Minimize Stress:** Keep routines simple and familiar, and limit loud noises or disruptions.  

  * **Offer Gentle Care:** Provide soothing touch through gentle petting and offer favorite treats if they can still eat.  

  * **Consider At-Home Euthanasia:** If appropriate, discuss the option of at-home euthanasia with your vet for a peaceful and familiar passing.  

  * **Reach Out for Support:** It's okay to lean on loved ones, pet-loss support groups, or counselors to help navigate this difficult time.



If you're noticing signs of declining health, we encourage you to use our [quality of life scale resource tool](https://www.codapet.com/quality-of-life-scale) to evaluate your pet's condition before your vet visit.

### What is the difference between at home pet euthanasia and euthanasia at a vet clinic?

The key difference is the setting. In home euthanasia allows your pet to pass peacefully in the comfort of their familiar surroundings, reducing stress and anxiety. This option especially benefits pets who may feel scared or uncomfortable traveling to a clinic. It also offers your family a private, intimate experience during this emotional time. While some urgent situations don’t allow for time to schedule in-home euthanasia, many pet owners in Littleton choose in-home services for the peaceful atmosphere and compassionate care their pets receive right where they feel safest. You can [find flexible availability](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment) for our local vets here or look for [same-day euthanasia](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request) appointments.

### Will my pet experience any pain during euthanasia?

No, pet euthanasia at home is designed to be completely painless. After an initial end-of-life assessment, your veterinarian will first administer a sedative to ensure your pet is relaxed and comfortable. The euthanasia medication then gently stops the heart without causing pain. The process is peaceful and allows your pet to pass without distress.

### Are there service providers for in home pet euthanasia near me?

### Do you provide 24-hour pet euthanasia services?

While we do not offer 24 hour pet euthanasia services, we do provide after-hours and emergency care in greater Littleton. You can request [same-day and urgent appointments](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request) to ensure your pet receives the compassionate care they need during critical moments.

### Is there an additional fee for after-hours or emergency services?

Yes, there is typically an additional fee for after-hours or emergency appointments. You can view the estimate when you request a [same-day or urgent appointment](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request).

### How much does at home pet euthanasia cost in my area?

The cost of at home pet euthanasia can vary in Littleton and the surrounding areas. Once you have picked your provider, the cost will usually depend on your pet’s size and any additional services you may choose, such as cremation, keepsakes, or other services. Our services start with a base fee of $275 for at home euthanasia. If your vet is traveling further than their local area, there is a travel fee applied based on how far you are from them. At CodaPet, we believe in giving you complete transparency and control over what you are choosing for your pet’s end-of-life care. This is why you can view a detailed price estimate before you complete reserving a time with your local vet. You can view [flexible availability and detailed pricing](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment) or request a [same-day appointment](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request) if this is more urgent. If you have any further questions, you can view our [FAQs](https://www.codapet.com/faqs) or reach us (833) 263 - 2738.

### Is the cost of euthanasia for dogs and cats the same?

Most providers in Littleton charge a flat fee for euthanasia, although some providers do charge based on the size of your pet, so small dogs and cats can be the same price; however, medium or large size dogs (such as Bulldogs, Australian Shepherds, Labradors, or German Shepherds) will likely carry a higher price. At CodaPet, most vets charge a flat fee for both dogs and cats; however, if there is a large pet fee, it will be applied automatically for you to review in the price estimate when you reserve an appointment. You can view the detailed [pricing and availability here](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment) or call us at (833) 263 - 2738.

### What should I expect during an in-home pet euthanasia appointment?

During an in-home euthanasia appointment, your veterinarian will make an assessment of your pet’s health and quality of life to provide guidance to ensure your decision is informed. The veterinarian will administer an initial sedative or anesthetic to help your pet relax and become pain-free, ensuring they are comfortable and at ease. In the last stage, your veterinarian will first ensure your pet is fully sedated before gently administering anesthesia, which will quickly slow down your pet’s respiratory system until the heart finally stops beating. In most cases, this process takes less than a minute. Your veterinarian will always move at your pace so the process is as comfortable as possible for your pet and your family.

### Can I choose a specific veterinarian for my pet’s euthanasia?

Yes, you can always choose the veterinarian you prefer, at the times they have available to reserve. You can see their [real-time availability](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment) or request a [same-day urgent appointment](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request) if no time suits your needs.

If you have any questions or specific needs, please don’t hesitate to reach out at (833) 263 - 2738.

### How far in advance do I need to make an appointment?

The notice for every veterinarian differs, however, most veterinarians require at least a **2-hour notice** from the time you need them to arrive at your home. This allows them time to prepare and ensure they can provide the highest level of care and compassion for your pet. It also accounts for their travel time, as your veterinarian may be traveling from many different locations around Littleton.

While you can request a [same-day and emergency services](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request), it's always best to contact us as early as possible to ensure availability and to give both you and your veterinarian time to prepare for this important moment

### What should I expect in terms of my pet’s behavior during the pet euthanasia process?

During the euthanasia process, your pet will be gently guided to a state of peace and comfort. After a sedative is administered, you can expect them to become calm and relaxed, free from any pain or distress. When the final injection is given, your pet will slowly drift off into a deep sleep before passing away peacefully. Your compassionate veterinarian will ensure the process is as gentle and serene as possible, allowing you to be present with your beloved companion in their final moments of love and care.

### Can I be with my pet during the euthanasia process?

Yes, during in home euthanasia process, you are encouraged to be with your pet throughout the entire process. Being there provides comfort and reassurance to your pet as they pass peacefully.

### How do I know when it’s time to consider euthanasia for my pet?

Every pet is different, and you know yours better than anyone, however, it may be time to consider euthanasia when you notice more ‘bad days than good’. It’s important to keep an eye on your pet’s quality of life and try to understand when it has declined, such as no longer enjoying activities or suffering from unmanageable pain. To help you understand their quality of life, you take a [Quality of Life Assessment](https://www.codapet.com/quality-of-life-scale), which helps you get a more clear picture of your pet’s well-being at this point in time.

Remember, if you are unsure, speaking with your primary care veterinarian can help better understand your pet’s quality of life. It’s important to speak with your primary care veterinarian if you haven’t yet to understand your pet’s health. If you do not have a primary care veterinarian, consider visiting an urgent care or emergency hospital in your area.

### How should I prepare my home for my pet’s euthanasia?

Everyone’s experience in saying goodbye to their beloved companion is different and very personal. It’s important to consider that you know your pet best. Some considerations, however, are choosing a comfortable space where your pet feels safe, sometimes their favorite spot in your home. Another consideration can be to gather any family members who wish to be present and feel free to bring your pet’s favorite blanket or toys, etc that make them feel comfortable. When your veterinarian arrives, they will guide you through each step in the process and help you move at your pace to ensure the process is as peaceful as possible.

### How long does the euthanasia procedure typically take?

**In-home euthanasia** procedures usually take about 10-15 minutes, however, the total time can vary depending on the pace you and your family prefer to move at and your pet’s comfort level. Your veterinarian will take the time necessary to ensure you feel you have enough time to be with your beloved pet while also ensuring your pet is calm and relaxed before proceeding. In some cases, this may take longer, especially if your pet is anxious or uncomfortable.

We understand that saying goodbye is a deeply emotional experience, and we encourage families to take as much time as they need during the process. Our goal is to create a peaceful and compassionate environment for both you and your pet.  


### What should I do after the euthanasia procedure is completed?

### What are my options for cremation?

After in-home euthanasia procedure, your veterinarian will provide you with time to say goodbye to your pet. Once you're ready, they will reconfirm the preferred aftercare option that you chose when reserving your time with your veterinarian. In Littleton, you can select two types of cremation services:

  * **Individual Cremation (Ashes Returned):** An individual cremation is a process where your pet will be cremated and separated with physical barriers in the chamber. This ensures the separation from other pets in the chamber so you may reunite with your pet’s ashes. Your pet’s ashes will be returned to you in an urn of your choice. If you choose an additional urn, then your pet’s ashes will be returned in the urn of your choice.  

  * **Communal Cremation (No Ashes Returned):** A communal cremation is a process where your pet is cremated in a chamber with other pets. Once the process is complete, the crematorium will respectfully scatter your pet’s remains among other pets. It’s important to note that your pet’s ashes will not be returned to you.



Some of our veterinarians offer an additional option known as **Ashes Returned (Private Cremation)**. In this option, only your pet is in the cremation chamber, ensuring that the recovered ashes are solely your pet's. These ashes can be returned in an urn of your choice, with additional urn options available. To see if private cremation is available with your provider, please refer to our [booking page](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment).

**Note** : If you choose to leave your pet's body with your veterinarian, rest assured it will be handled with the utmost care, respect, and dignity. Your veterinarian will coordinate all aftercare arrangements as requested, allowing you to focus on yourself and your family after this difficult goodbye.

### How do I get my pet’s ashes back?

### Are there any low-cost or no-cost pet euthanasia solutions?

Saying goodbye to a beloved pet is never easy, and we understand that cost can be a concern for many pet parents. While we specialize in premium in-home euthanasia services, we also want to acknowledge that cost may be a concern. If you're looking for low-cost or no-cost pet euthanasia options in Littleton, consider reaching out to the following:

  * **Local Animal Shelters & Humane Societies** – Many provide low-cost or donation-based euthanasia services, often with cremation options.  

    * **Foothills Animal Shelter  
** 580 McIntyre Street, Golden, CO, 80401  
303-278-7575  
info@fas4pets.org  

  * **Low-Cost Veterinary Clinics & Nonprofits** – Some vet clinics and nonprofits offer reduced-cost euthanasia, sometimes supported by grants or donations.  

  * **Animal Control Services** – In certain cases, local animal control agencies may offer euthanasia services for terminally ill or suffering pets at a lower cost.



**Note:** When considering a low-cost pet euthanasia option, it's important to call ahead to check availability, as some providers may require an appointment or have eligibility criteria, such as income-based assistance. Be sure to ask about additional costs, including cremation or aftercare services, which may not be included in the base price. Additionally, verify service details, as some options may have restrictions based on your pet’s size, health condition, or location.

While low-cost options are available, many pet parents choose in-home euthanasia to ensure a peaceful, stress-free farewell in the comfort of their home. If you're looking for a private, compassionate experience, we’re here to help.

> We had a sudden need for home pet euthanasia for our beloved little dog, Jellybean. None of our local vets offered the service timely, so we had to try an unknown. I found CodaPet online and there were appointments available. Dr. Gordon at CodaPet was wonderful. The whole process went smoothly. Communication was thorough. She was a little late, but kept us updated (because you can't rush these things). She said all the right things and comforted us in our decision. We are heartbroken, but at least this part will be a good memory. Our pup was at home, peaceful, and not stressed out by being at the vet. We pet him, cried, told stories, and he just fell asleep. People who provide this service are special people. We SO appreciated being home for his final day. We would not hesitate to recommend Dr. Gordon if you unfortunately need this service.

> After making the difficult decision to help our elderly bulldog cross the rainbow bridge, we found CodaPet online, offering in-home euthanasia. Our dog was a large breed and could hardly walk, and I couldn’t bear the thought of transporting her to a cold clinic for her final moments with us. Dr. Michelli arrived at our home and was so kind and gentle with our sweet girl; she explained to us how things would work and gave us time to answer any questions. We were so thankful to be able to say our final goodbyes to our fur baby in the privacy of our home and with her in the comfort of her own bed. Our hearts are broken by the loss, but I couldn’t have wished for a better way to have gone about this experience. Thank you, Dr. M and CodaPet. 🙏🏻🌈

> A very wonderful caring , warm and compassionate Dr Sara Gardhouse was the right person in my life to take care of my needs when it came to the final day of Rex’s life here on earth. She was accommodating to where I wanted. Rex euthanized . That to me was the greatest gift of all. Even though it rained all day, we went forward, so Rex wouldn’t suffer anymore. She answered questions I had after the procedure, when I was overwhelmed with heartbreak and grief, stating she was there for me if I needed. Dr. Sara Gardhouse, I can’t say enough how grateful I had her by our side, it was comforting. I would recommend her to anyone that needs in-home or out of home euthanasia.

> Dr. Sara went above and beyond for us when we chose humane in-home euthanasia for our beloved almost 13 year old dog we had to 11 wonderful years. He was extremely stressed out when he was at the dog hospital/vets office so we decided to bring him home and let him go peacefully in his favorite spot in the yard. He was loved and comfortable as much as he could be during the experience. Thank you Dr. Sara ❤️

> On 07/29/2025, our 14-year-old Goldendoodle, Teddy, passed away peacefully. Dr. Gardhouse was very compassionate. When she arrived, she started to rub Teddy's paw. The thing is that Teddy never liked his paws rubbed, but in this case, it soothed him. Dr. Gardhouse explained the procedure well and answered our questions. She gave us plenty of time to say our goodbyes, and nothing was rushed. We will miss him dearly, but Dr. Gardhouse made the process so much better. We are so glad we did it at home. Also, compared to other services, the price for the service was way more reasonable. I highly recommend using CodaPet. John D.

> I have had loved and lost a lot of pets. This was the first time I used an at home vet. I couldn't have another traumatic experience embrazened in my memory. Both my cat and I loved Dr. Amanda. She is so kind and respectful and she values the love you two share. I highly suggest that if you are considering this option you let Dr. Amanda help you.

> Dr. Sara was kind and compassionate during one of the most difficult moments for a pet owner. She allowed us to move along at our own pace during our dog Jack's crossing over the rainbow bridge, and let us take as much time as needed for each stage of the process. I highly recommend her as a vet for anyone that is facing this difficult time.

> Using CodaPet was so easy; from searching for a vet near me to clear pricing. Once booked they remained in constant communication with me throughout the process, providing time updates, etc. Our family was matched with Dr.Kelsey Jones and I can not recommend her enough. She arrived promptly, listened to our concerns, examined our furbaby Ciddy and gave us ample time to grieve and make the final decision. At no moment did I feel pressured to rush. She gave us time to set up an area outside and spoke to us like a friend throughout the process, while treating all of us with respect and compassion. She even made a suggestion on how to allow our other dog to say goodbye (which I would never have thought of). It’s not an easy choice to let go of a beloved pet but i feel this was the best way to do it and highly recommend her services.

> Dr. Gardhouse is one of the most caring veterinarians I have ever worked with. She went above and beyond to support us during this difficult time, and she genuinely cares for both the pets and their families. I would recommend her to anyone that wants nothing but the best for their little loved ones. She is truly exceptional, and genuinely suited for one of the most difficult jobs there is. Thank you, Dr. Gardhouse!

> Amazing. I went online in the morning at 6am and scheduled for 11am. They even have a link for more urgent response. Dr. Alex was incredibly compassionate and professional. I had never heard of this service before and my friend recommended it. Hands down this is the only way i will ever do this again. The gratitude i have for Dr. Alex and her service cannot be understated. I was very moved by the experience. My kitty had zero stress; i placed her on my lap while i sat on the bed. Dr. Alex was so gentle and kind. I cannot praise enough. Thank you so much.

> Our cat had reached the untreatable senior age of 18, and it meant a lot to say goodbye from the comfort of his home instead of taking him to the vet, where his last experience would've been stressful and upsetting for him. Interacting with Dr. Jessica was exactly what I was looking for during such a tough experience. Prompt, respectful, professional, and gentle. We thank her and CodaPet for their service.
