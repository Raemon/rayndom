# When Is It Time? Understanding Pet Euthanasia and End-of-Life Decisions

[Codapet](/experts/codapet)

May 28, 2025

Pet euthanasia is one of the most compassionate choices a pet parent can make during a pet’s end-of-life stage. This article explores how to recognize when it’s time, evaluate quality of life, and navigate emotional decisions. Drawing on insights from real CodaPet families, it offers practical tools and heartfelt wisdom to help guide you through this difficult yet loving choice.

  * Pet euthanasia is a compassionate option that prioritizes your pet’s comfort and dignity at the end of life.
  * Knowing when it's time involves recognizing signs of suffering, declining quality of life, and medical prognosis.
  * Pet euthanasia generally involves a calm, painless procedure performed by a veterinarian, followed by options for aftercare, such as cremation or burial.



Deciding to euthanize a beloved companion animal is one of the most difficult decisions any pet parent faces. It's a deeply personal journey wrought with emotion and unanswerable questions. So, how does anyone begin to trudge through such questions? We turned to the community of families using CodaPet’s quality of life questionnaire to find out. We reviewed the most common reasons cited when faced with euthanizing a beloved dog, cat, or companion animal. And asked families to anonymously share any words of wisdom they may have for other pet parents who are reaching this stage with their pet. Their insights and pearls of wisdom appear below to guide our discussion.

## Evaluating Quality of Life In Pets

It is quite hard to think objectively when assessing the life of someone who has brought you immeasurable joy and who relies on you to make the best decisions on their behalf. Using tools such as the [Quality of Life questionnaire](https://www.codapet.com/quality-of-life-scale) can help guide the process, especially when taken at regular intervals it can identify gradual changes. Another helpful tool is a calendar or journal to mark good days and days of struggle. When using a monthly layout, you can gain a visual representation of your pet’s quality of life. ​‍ ​‍  
‌  
Several key themes emerged from the responses we gathered from pet parents. While no two pet-loss journeys are the same, here are the most common threads observed by families considering pet euthanasia: physical distress, changes in behavior, serious illness, and loss of basic functions. Let’s take a closer look at each one and how other pet parents are thinking through these issues. ​‍ ​‍

## Physical Distress

Physical distress may include persistent pain, nausea, and trouble breathing (respiratory distress is always an emergency). Some of these signs will be more apparent than others, and some may be able to be managed through medication or therapeutic treatments. However, families will eventually reach a point where their pet is decompensating, and interventions are no longer effective in keeping physical distress at bay. As one pet parent said, “As long as she isn’t in pain, I feel she still has some quality of life and I don’t feel selfish keeping her with me.” ​‍ ​‍ ‌

## Behavioral Shifts in Pets

Significant changes in behavior can manifest in a myriad of ways. Commonly quoted changes include loss of appetite leading to drastic weight loss, marked lethargy, diminished hygiene or self-grooming efforts, and loss of toileting habits. In the absence of dramatic changes, it can be helpful to consider a short list of your pet’s favorite activities.  
  
For a dog, this may include barking at delivery drivers, excitement over eating, and taking walks around the neighborhood. For our feline friends, the list could be jumping onto a favorite surface, meowing at feeding time, and claiming empty bags or boxes as their own.

## Serious Illness

While illnesses such as cancer or kidney failure are mentioned, the decision is often more focused on the accompanying symptoms and the pet's suffering rather than the disease itself. We may theorize that this results from cases when pet parents see signs of illness that have not been definitively diagnosed. If there can be a silver lining here it is that serious illnesses and subsequent suffering make the decision t‍o euthanize a little easier.  
  
That is not to say the emotional burden is lighter, just that the confidence in it being “the right time” is often stronger. One respondent reflected on their pet’s condition, saying, “He was not his normal self, and keeping him with [us] feels selfish.” Another pet parent saw what likely lay ahead and said, “I don't want my pet to…go through all of those difficulties. She does not deserve that, even if it's not necessary, just because I'm going to miss her terribly. She was good to us, and I want to be good to her in her end-of-life stage.” ​‍ ​‍

## Loss of Basic Functions

While there is some overlap here with the behavioral changes, answers frequently cited the ability to maintain bladder and bowel control, the inability to stand or move independently, and refusal or inability to eat or drink. Mental acuity is another basic function that can be hard to identify when lost. Cognitive decline can manifest in a variety of signs, such as altered sleep and wake cycles, house soiling, and disorientation, which often overlap with significant behavioral changes.  
  
Caretaker fatigue can play a larger role in cases where pets have lost basic functions but are not dying from a specific disease process. When autonomy is lost, but death is not imminent, many pet parents struggle to weigh their pet’s loss of dignity and their own emotions. We heard many responses saying, “‌I feel [he] is ready to go but I’m having a hard time making the final decision.”

## No simple answer ​‍ ​‍ ‌

Euthanasia is a deeply personal decision grounded in the unique relationship between a pet and its parent. What stands out from the experiences shared by our community of pet parents is that it’s compassion for the pet that drives the decision-making process, and that it's normal to experience a wide range of emotions, from guilt and sorrow to relief when the pet finds peace after suffering. ​‍
