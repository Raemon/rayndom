Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

Growing up on a farm, I saw many animals with bite wounds from dogs, trauma from getting stuck in fences, and mamas having trouble giving birth. I wanted so badly to grow up and learn how to help them. After being in private practice for several years, I saw how meaningful and peaceful it was for families to say goodbye to an animal they loved in the comfort of their own homes. I discovered that I enjoyed making sure the pet has a peaceful passing with no fear or pain, and being able to help a family memorialize the friend they love so much.

> This is a difficult review but I know that it will help others, so here we go. I booked this difficult service online. At first I thought that it seemed impersonal. In retrospect, it was not. It was easier to not speak to someone. The system was easy to navigate. I set it up, for the Tuesday after the Easter weekend. Sadly, my kitty had a change in condition and it became more emergent as time went on. He was 18, in my mind this was just part of it. It wasn’t any easier for sure. As his decline was eminent, I reached out to Dr. Amanda and she was able to fit us in. She gave us a window for arriving and even gave a heads up when she was 20 minutes away. She was so kind and understanding. She treated our Ozzy and us like family. Our dog was present and all over her (100+ pounds). She was so sweet with him, letting him snuggle her as it was clearly difficult for him too. I’ll leave out the details, but she made it smooth and was so sweet. I am thankful our baby didn’t have to suffer and now we will try to work through the grief. Highly recommend this home service if it works for you and your cherished pet. Thank you again Dr. AMANDA. 😻

> Dr.Amanda McCasland was so kind and compassionate with me and my golden retriever. She had no hesitation to come at an undesirable time of evening to give Winston what he needed to rest in peace. At home euthanasia is so special and peaceful for you and your companion especially to have a devoted, loving and reassuring veterinarian to be with us. She does it all with gracefulness, respect and sincerity. Thank you Dr. McCasland for being so attentive to me and my Winston.

> Words cannot express how compassionate, sensitive, personal, and professional Dr. McCasland was. She explained each step and let us take as long as we needed for each step. I am so thankful that we were able to be with Duncan at home during this difficult time. I cannot even imagine what it would have been like to have to take him in the car and be in the vet's office for his final moments. Duncan was not under any additional stress; and although it was very difficult for us, being at home in our own surroundings with such a compassionate doctor somehow made it easier. While we are grieving deeply, knowing that we made Duncan's last moments as stress free as possible provides us with a little comfort. After placing Duncan in Dr. McCasland's car surrounded by soft, comfortable blankets, Dr. McCasland gave both of us a big hug. Thank you, Dr. McCasland for making such a difficult situation somewhat easier.

> Dr McCasland was so amazing with Drumline. It was such a hard time for us having to say goodbye (for now). She wasn't rushed at all and spoke so sweetly. Her compassion and personal attention to us and him was unsurpassed. I will forever be grateful for her.

> My experience with Dr. Amanda McCasland was everything I could have hoped for when I made the heartbreaking decision to let my precious little Bam Bam go on without me. She was so kind and compassionate. Nothing was hurried, I never felt that a clock was ticking. As he started to get drowsy, Dr. Amanda listened as I spoke about (and to) my little Bammie . In my way, I was honoring his life by talking about how he found us, what a special little guy he had been, how blessed I always felt to be his person and how much he would be missed. In Dr. Amanda's way, she honored his life by being genuinely interested in him and his comfort, and making his transition as seamless as possible for the both of us. I love that the last thing Bam Bam heard was my voice and my heart beating as he laid in my arms with his head on my chest. I would not change a thing. I am so grateful to Dr. McCasland for her most excellent care and her compassion for me and little Bam Bam.

> Dr. Amanda McCasland was so compassionate and professional. She totally understood our grief and gave us resources. She also followed up. She made our fur baby so comfortable during the entire process. The in home process was so worth it. For the fur baby and us too. We never felt rushed. It made a difficult time so much easier. I would highly recommend CodaPet and especially Dr. McCasland. I painted this picture of our Sierra this week. 💕 We miss you, baby girl. 😢 Thank you.

> Bandit was beloved by so many for 15 1/2 years. When his time came, we decided to have his goodbye at home. We lucked out and got Dr. McCasland. She was so kind and treated Bandit as if she’d known him his whole life. She stroked him while listening to our stories. We never felt hurried. It was the best experience you could imagine considering. We are grateful.

> Dr McCasland was very kind and compassionate in helping with my dog who had suffered a long term illness. When I asked she explained the process to me in terms I could understand, which also helped me through the process. I was allowed to be there the whole time and saw she was very respectful and gentle with my dog. The process was peaceful and quiet as we were able to do it at my home. I am very grateful to have such an outstanding vet help me navigate this difficult process.

> The decision we had to make to euthanize our dear Charlie was one of the hardest decisions I have ever had to make. He hated to travel so I couldn't bear the thought of having to force him into the car so we started to look at at-home euthanasia. When Amanda came into our house, she was so sweet and loving. She was gentle and caring...she truly gave Charlie a peaceful passing. She explained the process to us and went above and beyond even leaving a small shaving of his hair along with a brochure on the grieving process. I hope that we never have to use her services again, but if so, I would call her in a heart beat. I just can't sing enough of her praises. If it's time to say goodbye to your dearly loved pet, please consider Dr. McCasland.

> This was a very empathetic and caring experience. Dr McCasland was 10/10❤️ She provided extraordinary care for our sweet Ellie and supportive empathy for our entire family. She had extra special touches for our memories including a little bag of Ellie’s hair and a soft blanket and basket for her to take her final car ride. These little things mean so much!
