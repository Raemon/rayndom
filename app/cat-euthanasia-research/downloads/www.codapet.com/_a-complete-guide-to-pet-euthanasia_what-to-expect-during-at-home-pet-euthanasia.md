# What to expect during at-home pet euthanasia?

The process begins with the arrival of the veterinarian at your home. The first step is to engage in a conversation with you about your pet's health, overall condition and quality of life. 

Facing the decision of [in-home euthanasia](https://www.codapet.com/pet-euthanasia-near-me) for your cherished pet is undoubtedly one of the most challenging moments you will ever have to face with your pet, and we want to provide a compassionate understanding of what this process entails.

In-home pet euthanasia can often be seen as the Final Gift to your pet—a chance for them to be surrounded by familiar comforts, in their favorite place, and with the people they love. It provides the opportunity for your pet to peacefully pass away in the embrace of a setting they hold dear, akin to drifting into a deep slumber.

The process begins with the arrival of the veterinarian at your home. The first step is to engage in a conversation with you about your pet's health, overall condition and quality of life. Next, your veterinarian will conduct an ‘exam’ and discuss their findings with you and share whether they support your decision to proceed with a humane euthanasia or if alternative treatments could be provided. Together, your veterinarian will create a personalized and peaceful plan to help your pet transition.

To ensure your pet's comfort, a relaxing sedative will be administered, allowing them to peacefully drift into a deep sleep. Once your pet is soundly asleep and pain-free, the final medication is given. These medications are carefully chosen to alleviate any pain and anxiety your pet may be experiencing, providing a compassionate and dignified transition from life to death.

Throughout every step of the process, the veterinarian's focus is on ensuring your pet's comfort and relieving them of any pain or suffering. The medications used are specifically designed for this purpose.

After your pet has passed, the veterinarian will give you and your family private time to grieve. This time allows you, your family and any furry family members to say your goodbyes, collect keepsakes if desired, and reflect on the beautiful moments you shared with your pet.

If you choose, the veterinarian can [assist in making arrangements for your pet's body care](https://www.codapet.com/pet-cremation-near-me), respecting your wishes and providing support during this difficult time.
