# Understanding Feline Upper Respiratory Infections

[Dr. Bethany Hsia](/experts/dr-bethany-hsia)

September 20, 2024

Feline Upper Respiratory Infections (URIs) are complex diseases affecting cats' upper respiratory tracts. This article explores the causes, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of URIs, providing pet parents with essential information to help their feline companions through these challenging health issues.

## **Key takeaways**

  1. URIs are primarily caused by viral agents, with feline herpesvirus and calicivirus responsible for most cases.
  2. Common symptoms include sneezing, nasal discharge, and conjunctivitis.
  3. Diagnosis often involves clinical signs and may require advanced testing for complex cases.
  4. Treatment focuses on supportive care and managing symptoms, with antibiotics used for secondary bacterial infections.



Prevention strategies include vaccination, environmental management, and boosting the feline immune system.

## **Definition and Common Causes**

Feline Upper Respiratory Infection (URI) is a complex of diseases affecting cats' upper respiratory tracts, including the nose, throat, and sinuses. This condition is primarily caused by viral agents, with feline herpesvirus (FHV) and feline calicivirus (FCV) responsible for the vast majority of cases. Bacterial pathogens such as Bordetella bronchiseptica and Chlamydophila felis also play a significant role in URIs. Other possible causative agents include fungi and protozoa (single-celled organisms). Any one of these pathogens may cause a URI and more than one may be present at a time.

The viral agents responsible for causing URIs are highly contagious and can spread through direct contact with infected cats or exposure to contaminated environments. FVR particles can be infectious as long as they remain moist; such as those in saliva, nasal secretions, or ocular discharge left behind on bedding or other surfaces. Meanwhile, dry surfaces contaminated with FCV can remain infectious for weeks at room temperature.

## **Prevalence in Cat Populations**

The prevalence of upper respiratory infections in cats varies widely depending on the setting with high-density cat populations at particular risk. Such settings include shelters, feline rescue facilities, feral colonies, and catteries for breeding or boarding. Often these environments are stressful to cats and stress is linked to higher URI rates. Stress decreases the immune system’s efficiency in general, but also increases the shedding of FHV. As a member of the herpesvirus family, FHV, usually causes a lifelong infection with long periods of latency but possible flare ups and shedding at any time.

## **Transmission Methods**

Upper respiratory infections in cats are highly contagious and can spread through various methods. Direct contact between infected and susceptible cats is a primary transmission route and usually passes via saliva, nasal secretions, or discharge from eyes. Transmission can also occur via aerosolized droplets such as when an infected cat sneezes near a potential host. While FHV and FCV are species specific, other URI causing pathogens may infect across species.

## **Recognizing Symptoms of Upper Respiratory Infections in Cats**

### Common Signs and Symptoms

Feline upper respiratory infections manifest through a variety of signs and the causative agent(s) involved may affect exactly which signs are evident. Generally, URI cats demonstrate discharge from the eyes and nose along with potential loss of appetite, lethargy, sneezing, coughing, or nasal congestion, Cats with URIs often exhibit conjunctivitis, characterized by redness and swelling of the membranes surrounding the eye, and in some cases, may develop ulcers of the eyes, nose, or inside the mouth. Rarely, infected cats experience difficulty breathing which can indicate the infection has spread to the lower airway (trachea, bronchi, lungs). Difficulty breathing should be treated as an emergency and warrants urgent veterinary attention.

### Severity Spectrum of URI Symptoms

The severity of feline upper respiratory infection symptoms can range from mild to severe, with a spectrum of clinical presentations. Mild cases may exhibit occasional sneezing and clear nasal discharge, while moderate cases often present with persistent sneezing, nasal and ocular discharge, and mild lethargy. Severe cases can manifest with marked respiratory distress, anorexia, fever, and even life-threatening complications.

The progression of symptoms is influenced by factors such as the specific pathogen involved, the cat's immune status, and potential environmental stressors. Your veterinarian can assess and track the severity of your cat’s URI to recommend appropriate treatment and management strategies in both individual and multi-cat settings.

## **Diagnosis and Treatment Options**

### Veterinary Diagnostic Procedures

Veterinary diagnostic procedures for feline upper respiratory infections vary depending on the suspected causal agent. However in most acute cases, diagnosis is often presumptive and based on characteristic clinical signs, such as sneezing, nasal discharge, and conjunctivitis.

For more complex or chronic cases, veterinarians may employ advanced diagnostics to isolate the exact infectious agent. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is useful for virus detection, cultures can be helpful in identifying viral or bacterial growth from samples swabbed in the cat’s conjunctiva, nose, or oropharynx. Imaging techniques such as X-rays play a crucial role in assessing lower airway involvement and may raise the level of suspicion for a fungal cause of the infection.

### Treatments and Symptomatic Care

The main treatment goal for acute URI cases is to support the cat as their body fights the infection. In the case of bacterial or fungal URIs the treatment will include antibiotics and antifungals respectively. Antiviral medications may be used in more chronic or severe cases. Other treatments are focused on symptom abatement such as antiinflammatories, mucolytics, and decongestants.

### Supportive Care and Home Remedies

Supportive care plays a crucial role in managing feline upper respiratory infections. Creating a low-stress environment is essential for recovery, as stress can exacerbate symptoms and prolong healing. In addition to providing a quiet comfortable space to rest and recuperate it is important to minimize stressful restraint of the cat while administering medication.

Maintaining proper hydration and nutritional support is vital for affected cats. Cats with URIs may decrease their food intake due to lethargy, painful oral ulcers, or inappetence related to their nasal congestion. Offering pungent canned food can entice cats with diminished olfaction due to congestion. Gently warming the food may further increase its appeal. Feeding canned food comes with the added benefit of helping the cat maintain hydration as compared to feeding dry food.

Steam therapy can be beneficial in alleviating nasal congestion; pet parents may consider keeping their cat in the bathroom during showers to help moisten nasal passages and loosen secretions. Be mindful of your cat’s comfort with this as increased stress will be counterproductive. Adding humidifiers to areas where the cat spends most of their time can help combat overdrying. Also in the interest of maintaining moisture, your veterinarian may provide topical tear replacement for cats with ocular involvement.

### Managing Complications and Secondary Infections

Secondary bacterial infections are a common complication of feline upper respiratory infections. Therefore, broad spectrum antibiotics are often prescribed prophylactically when development of a secondary bacterial infection is a concern. To diminish the risk of antibiotic resistance, antibiotic selection should be based on culture and sensitivity testing when possible, especially in chronic cases.

## **Prevention Strategies for Feline Upper Respiratory Infections**

### Vaccination Protocols

Core vaccines for cats include a combination vaccine frequently referred to as Feline Distemper or FVRCP. The “FVR” portion of the name stands for feline viral rhinotracheitis, also known as Feline Herpes Virus or FHV. The “C” in FVRCP stands for feline caliciviruses. Both of these viruses can cause URI in cats. The last letter does not cause URI but gives the vaccine its nickname: feline distemper. This disease is also known as panleukopenia giving us the “P” in FVRCP.

The FVRCP vaccine is an important part of feline routine wellness. It is usually given to kittens beginning around 6 weeks of age with boosters every 3-4 weeks until 16 weeks of age. For adult cats, the vaccine schedule will vary depending on the vaccine manufacturer and the cat’s previous booster history. It is important to note that even though FVRCP vaccines do not provide complete protection against URIs they can reduce the illness’ duration, severity, and shedding. Additionally, vaccination is important to provide coverage against panleukopenia.

Vaccines against Chlamydophila felis and against Bordetella bronchiseptica also exist. However, these are not considered core-vaccines by the American Association of Feline Practitioners (AAFP) nor American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA). As such, your vet’s recommendations will be based on the risk factors specific to your cat.

### Environmental Management in Multi-cat Households

Environmental management in multi-cat households is an anchor for controlling feline upper respiratory infections. Reducing stress is paramount, as it can trigger reactivation of latent herpesvirus as well as general weakening of the immune system. Providing adequate space is essential, with access to plenty of places for hiding and solitude if desired.

Proper ventilation and air quality management are important, as poor air quality can exacerbate respiratory issues and contribute to the spread of URIs to uninfected housemates. Regular cleaning of shared spaces and items is important, with additional spot cleaning as needed.

If you have a multi-cat household with a cat suffering from a URI it is important to speak with your veterinarian about establishing a quarantine protocol that is effective for your situation. It is also crucial to quarantine any cats that are new to the home. Allowing both the existing felines and the newcomer to adjust to the stress of change will help prevent the transmission of a URI.

### Boosting Feline Immune System Health

Boosting feline immune system health is crucial for preventing and managing upper respiratory infections. A high-quality, balanced diet rich in essential nutrients forms a firm foundation for a healthy cat. Regular exercise promotes blood circulation, strengthens the cardiovascular system, and can reduce stress, contributing to improved immunity.

Veterinarians sometimes recommend probiotics that support gut health for prevention of FHV URI flare ups or as supportive care for chronic cases.The rationale for giving beneficial bacteria supplements to combat FHV rests on their role in promoting balance to the gut microbiome and therefore contributing to overall immunity.

## **Long-term Management and Prognosis**

### Potential Long-term Effects on Feline Health

URIs in cats can lead to long-term effects on health. One such health consequence is chronic post-viral rhinitis, which results in a persistently snotty and sniffly cat. It is believed to result from permanent changes to the nasal cavity following acute viral infections. Such changes may include the growth of fleshy polyps within the nasal cavity or oropharynx, fibrosis of the delicate mucosal surfaces, or remodeling of sinuses.

Ocular damage is another potential long-term effect, particularly in cats with infections due to FHV. These can include several diseases of the cornea in which the tissue is weakened, scarred, partially ruptured, or a focal portion dies. Visual impairment may result from any of these conditions.

Special Considerations for Different Cat Populations

### URIs in Kittens and Senior Cats

Kittens are particularly susceptible to upper respiratory infections due to their immature immune systems. They often experience more severe symptoms and are at higher risk for complications such as pneumonia. Vaccination is crucial for kittens, with the FVRCP core vaccine priming the immune system against feline herpesvirus and calicivirus, as well as panleukopenia.

Senior cats, on the other hand, may have compromised immune function due to age-related factors or concurrent health issues, making them more vulnerable to URIs or more likely to see the return of a latent FHV infection.

## **Conclusion**

Upper respiratory infections are a common foe for our feline friends. As such, it is helpful to understand more about them and how you can help your cat through a URI, or preferably to avoid it altogether. From recognizing early symptoms to implementing effective prevention strategies, pet parents play a vital role in their cats' respiratory health.
