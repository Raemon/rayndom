The decision is never easy and all we wanted was our Calypso to pass peacefully and as stress free as possible. That is exactly what we got with Dr. Ann. 10/10 for her services. It was my husband's first time and I was so glad he didn't have to experience Calypso being so nervous as she would be anywhere other than home.

## Pet euthanasia and cremation pricing in Chicago, IL

### Reservations and payments

Your credit card is required to reserve your appointment. However, no payment is required until the appointment and nothing is due until the appointment is completed

### Cancellation policy or pet passing

We charge cancellation fee of $100 if an appointment is cancelled less than 4 hours before the start time. If your pet passes away before your appointment you would not be charged a cancellation fee. If the vet you scheduled is able, and you would like their assistance with cremation, then pickup fee would apply instead of euthanasia fee

## Other Consideration

### Large Animals

If you have a larger pet, your vet may need the help of one friend or family member. Talk to your vet about options and limitations when they reach out to you prior to your appointment, and they will inform you of any extra cost for your situation. 

### How do I get my pet’s ashes

Options for your pets return home and memorabilia depend on your local provider. Your vet coordinate the return of your pet’s ashes and let you know if there are additional fees for urn delivery. 

### Special factors affecting price

Extra time or medications needed can affect the total price. Other factors can be if it is decided that it’s not time to euthanize your pet after the vet has arrive. In that case, only the travel fee, platform fee, and a quality of life consult would apply. 

## FAQs

### What’s included in the total cost?

The total cost includes the in-home pet euthanasia service fee, any travel fee (if any apply), and a platform fee. Additionally, depending on your choice, fees may apply for cremation services or keepsakes.

### Will the vet take my pet with them after the appointment?

During your appointment, your vet will confirm your aftercare selection with you. If you choose to arrange cremation services, your vet will oversee your pet’s transportation to a local facility for cremation. If your preferred cremation option includes the return of your pet’s ashes to you, your vet will discuss the process to reunite you with your pet's ashes and the anticipated time frame during your appointment

### Will the vet examine my pet once they get to my home?

Yes, upon arrival the veterinarian will assess your pet. This can look different than an “nose to tail” examination in a clinic setting and will focus more on the pet’s history and quality of life.

### What if I am not sure it is time?

It is not uncommon to have doubts about whether the time is right. If you’ve taken the Quality of Life Questionnaire and are still unsure, we recommend consulting with your family veterinarian before scheduling an appointment.  
  
Rest assured, if you book an appointment, your in-home euthanasia veterinarian will let you know if they do not believe that euthanasia is appropriate at this time.

### How long will the procedure take?

You can expect your veterinarian to be in your home from 20-60 minutes, depending on how much of that time you need or want throughout the process.

### What is at home pet euthanasia, and how does it work?

At home pet euthanasia allows your pet to pass away peacefully in the comfort of your home surrounded by love. A compassionate veterinarian will provide end-of-life care for your pet starting with an initial end-of-life exam followed by sedation to ensure your pet is comfortable. Your vet will always move at your pace so you have the time you need to say your goodbyes. Once you are ready, your vet will administer medication to help them gently and painlessly say goodbye surrounded by comfort and love.

### How do I tell if my pet is suffering?

Signs your pet may be suffering include chronic pain, difficulty breathing, loss of appetite, inability to stand or walk, or a loss of interest in daily activities. These symptoms could indicate a decline in their quality of life. You know your pet better than anyone, but speaking to a veterinarian can help you assess whether euthanasia is the most compassionate option. If you feel you need more help, you can read our guide on ‘[How will I know it’s time](https://www.codapet.com/how-will-i-know-when-its-time)’, take a [quality of life assessment](https://www.codapet.com/quality-of-life-scale), or call customer care at 833-263-2738.

### What should I do if my pet is declining fast?

If your pet's health is declining rapidly, it’s crucial to take the following steps:

  * **Consult Your Veterinarian** : Schedule an appointment to discuss your observations and any scoring from a quality-of-life scale. This information can help guide the conversation about your pet's condition and options moving forward. Your vet may suggest palliative care, hospice, or, if necessary, euthanasia.



  * **Ensure Comfort** : Create a quiet, cozy space with soft bedding and easy access to food, water, and a litter box (if applicable).  

  * **Minimize Stress** : Keep routines simple and familiar, and limit loud noises or disruptions.  

  * **Offer Gentle Care** : Provide soothing touch through gentle petting and offer favorite treats if they can still eat.  

  * **Consider At-Home Euthanasia** : If appropriate, discuss the option of at-home euthanasia with your vet for a peaceful and familiar passing.  

  * **Reach Out for Support** : It's okay to lean on loved ones, pet-loss support groups, or counselors to help navigate this difficult time.



  
If you're noticing signs of declining health, we encourage you to use our [quality of life scale resource tool](https://www.codapet.com/quality-of-life-scale) to evaluate your pet's condition before your vet visit.

### What is the difference between in home pet euthanasia and euthanasia at a vet clinic?

The key difference is the setting. In home euthanasia allows your pet to pass peacefully in the comfort of their familiar surroundings, reducing stress and anxiety. This option especially benefits pets who may feel scared or uncomfortable traveling to a clinic. It also offers your family a private, intimate experience during this emotional time. While some urgent situations don’t allow for time to schedule in-home euthanasia, many pet owners in Chicago choose in-home services for the peaceful atmosphere and compassionate care their pets receive right where they feel safest. You can [find flexible availability](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment) for our local vets here, or look for [same-day euthanasia](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request) appointments.

  


### Will my pet experience any pain during euthanasia?

No, pet euthanasia at home is designed to be completely painless. After an initial end-of-life assessment, your veterinarian will first administer a sedative to ensure your pet is relaxed and comfortable. The euthanasia medication then gently stops the heart without causing pain. The process is peaceful and allows your pet to pass without distress.

The cost of at home pet euthanasia can vary in Chicagoland and the surrounding areas. Once you have picked your provider, the cost will usuallydepend on your pet’s size and any additional services you may choose, such as cremation, keepsakes, or other services. Our services start with a **base fee of $350 for in home euthanasia**. If your vet is traveling further than their local area, there is a travel fee applied based on how far you are from them. At CodaPet, we believe in giving you complete transparency and control over what you are choosing for your pet’s end-of-life care. This is why you can view a detailed price estimate before you complete reserving a time with your local vet.

If you have any further questions, you can view our [FAQs](https://www.codapet.com/faqs) or reach us **(833) 263 - 2738**.

### Is the cost of euthanasia for dogs and cats the same?

Most providers in Chicagoland charge a flat fee for euthanasia, although some providers do charge based on the size of your pet, so small dogs and cats can be the same price; however, medium or large size dogs (such as Bulldogs, Australian Shepherds, Labradors, or German Shepherds) will likely carry a higher price. At CodaPet, most vets charge a flat fee for both dogs and cats; however, if there is a large pet fee, it will be applied automatically for you to review in the price estimate when you reserve an appointment. You can view the detailed [pricing and availability here](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment) or call us at **(833) 263 - 2738**.

### What should I expect during an in home pet euthanasia appointment?

During an in home euthanasia appointment, your veterinarian will make an assessment of your pet’s health and quality of life to provide guidance to ensure your decision is informed. The veterinarian will administer an initial sedative or anesthetic to help your pet relax and become pain-free, ensuring they are comfortable and at ease. In the last stage, your veterinarian will first ensure your pet is fully sedated before gently administering anesthesia which will quickly slow down your pet’s respiratory system until the heart finally stops beating. In most cases, this process takes less than a minute. Your veterinarian will always move at your pace so the process is as comfortable as possible for your pet and your family.

### Who is the veterinarian providing at-home pet euthanasia services in Chicago?

If you're searching for at-home pet euthanasia in Chicago and the surrounding areas, you're in compassionate hands with our local veterinarian. Below, you can learn more about her professional journey and what inspired her to offer peaceful in-home euthanasia services.

**Dr. Ann Gonnering** , a compassionate veterinarian specializing in at-home pet euthanasia, grew up in the Chicago suburbs. She earned both her undergraduate and veterinary degrees from the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana. Her career took her to New Zealand, where she discovered the intimate and comforting nature of in-home euthanasia—a practice that profoundly shaped her approach to end-of-life care.

With experience caring for a variety of animals, including dogs, cats, and rabbits, Dr. Gonnering strives to provide a peaceful farewell for pets in the comfort of their familiar surroundings. Her own experiences with her beloved cats—like Archie, a resilient FIP survivor, and Jasper, who traveled with her from New Zealand—deepen her understanding of the emotional journey pet families face.

**To hear from other pet parents about their experiences with Dr. Gonnering, visit her[profile](https://www.codapet.com/veterinarians/dr-ann-gonnering).**

### Do you offer any quality-of-life consultations?

Yes, your local veterinarian offers in-person and tele-consults depending on availability for a separate fee. In order to reserve a time to speak with a local veterinarian, please call **833-263-2738**.

  
**Note:** This consultation is aimed at providing advice on end-of-life care and quality-of-life questions. Your veterinarian is not offering telemedicine and is not able to provide specific diagnosis or treatments. If you have any medical needs, please visit your primary care veterinarian.

### How far in advance do I need to make an appointment?

The notice for every veterinarian differs, however, most veterinarians require at least a **2-hour notice** from the time you need them to arrive at your home. This allows them time to prepare and ensure they can provide the highest level of care and compassion for your pet. It also accounts for their travel time, as your veterinarian may be traveling from many different locations around Chicago.

  
While you can request a [same-day and emergency services](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request), it's always best to contact us as early as possible to ensure availability and to give both you and your veterinarian time to prepare for this important moment.

### What should I expect in terms of my pet’s behavior during the pet euthanasia process?

During the euthanasia process, your pet will be gently guided to a state of peace and comfort. After a sedative is administered, you can expect them to become calm and relaxed, free from any pain or distress. When the final injection is given, your pet will slowly drift off into a deep sleep before passing away peacefully. Your compassionate veterinarian will ensure the process is as gentle and serene as possible, allowing you to be present with your beloved companion in their final moments of love and care.

### Can I be with my pet during the euthanasia process?

Yes, during in home euthanasia process, you are encouraged to be with your pet throughout the entire process. Being there provides comfort and reassurance to your pet as they pass peacefully.

### How do I know when it’s time to consider euthanasia for my pet?

Every pet is different, and you know yours better than anyone, however, it may be time to consider euthanasia when you notice more ‘bad days than good’. It’s important to keep an eye on your pet’s quality of life and try to understand when it has declined, such as no longer enjoying activities or suffering from unmanageable pain. To help you understand their quality of life, you take a [Quality of Life Assessment](https://www.codapet.com/quality-of-life-scale), which helps you get a more a clear picture of your pet’s well-being at this point in time.

Remember, if you are unsure, speaking with your primary care veterinarian can help better understand your pet’s quality of life. It’s important to speak with your primary care veterinarian if you haven’t yet to understand your pet’s health. If you do not have a primary care veterinarian, consider visiting an urgent care or emergency hospital in your area.

  


### How should I prepare my home for my pet’s euthanasia?

Everyone’s experience in saying goodbye to their beloved companion is different and very personal. It’s important to consider that you know your pet best. Some considerations, however, are choosing a comfortable space where your pet feels safe, sometimes their favorite spot in your home. Another consideration can be to gather any family members who wish to be present, and feel free to bring your pet’s favorite blanket or toys, etc that make them feel comfortable. When your veterinarian arrives they will guide you through each step in the process and help you move at your pace to ensure the process is as peaceful as possible.

### How long does the euthanasia procedure typically take?

In home euthanasia procedures usually take about 10-15 minutes, however the total time can vary depending on the pace you and your family prefer to move at and your pet’s comfort level. Your veterinarian will take the time necessary to ensure you feel you have enough time to be with your beloved pet while also ensuring your pet is calm and relaxed before proceeding. In some cases, this may take longer, especially if your pet is anxious or uncomfortable.

We understand that saying goodbye is a deeply emotional experience, and we encourage families to take as much time as they need during the process. Our goal is to create a peaceful and compassionate environment for both you and your pet.

### What should I do after the euthanasia procedure is completed?

After the euthanasia, you are welcome to spend as much time as you need with your pet to say goodbye. If you’ve chosen any cremation services to handle your pet’s body, your veterinarian will reconfirm your choices and gently transport your pet when you are ready. If you’ve chosen any keepsakes offered by the crematorium, like Claw Paw Prints, Ink nose prints, or other memorabilia, your veterinarian will reconfirm your choices before leaving your home. If you have any questions or want to change your mind about any of your choices, you can discuss your options with your veterinarian before they leave your home.

### What are my options for cremation?

After the in home euthanasia procedure, your veterinarian will provide you with time to say goodbye to your pet. Once you're ready, they will reconfirm the preferred aftercare option that you choose when reserving your time with your veterinarian. In Chicago, you can select two types of cremation services:

  * **Private Cremation (Ashes Returned)** : An individual cremation is a process where your pet will be cremated separated with physical barriers in the chamber. This ensures the separation with other pets in the chamber so you may reunite with your pet’s ashes. Your pet’s ashes will be returned to you in an urn of your choice. If you choose an additional urn then your pet’s ashes will be returned in the urn of your choice.  

  * **Communal Cremation (No Ashes Returned)** : A communal cremation is a process where your pet is cremated in a chamber with other pets. Once the process is complete, the crematorium will respectfully scatter your pet’s remains among other pets. It’s important to note, you pet’s ashes will not be returned to you.  




**Note** : If you choose to leave your pet's body with your veterinarian, rest assured it will be handled with the utmost care, respect, and dignity. Your veterinarian will coordinate all aftercare arrangements as requested, allowing you to focus on yourself and your family after this difficult goodbye.

### How do I get my pet’s ashes back?

Your veterinarian will coordinate the return of your pet’s ashes before they leave your home. Your options include having your pet’s remains delivered by your veterinarian (for an additional fee), shipping them to you (for an additional fee), or picking them up from your primary clinic or the crematorium.  
  
Additionally, the crematorium offers the option for owners to pick up their pet's ashes directly, or for a more personal touch, they provide hand delivery (for an additional cost). This ensures that the ashes and any keepsakes are delivered safely, as the crematorium prefers to avoid standard shipping due to the risk of loss or damage to irreplaceable items.

### Are there any low-cost or no-cost solutions?

Saying goodbye to a beloved pet is never easy, and we understand that cost can be a concern for many pet parents. While we offer premium in-home euthanasia services, we also want to ensure that you have access to affordable options in Chicago if you're on a budget.

Below are some low-cost euthanasia options available in Chicago.

**Anti-Cruelty**  
157 West Grand Ave. Chicago, IL 60654  
312-644-8338

**Chicago Animal Care & Control**  
2741 S Western Ave, Chicago, IL 60608  
312-747-1406  
  
**Note** : When considering a low-cost pet euthanasia option, it's important to call ahead to check availability, as some providers may require an appointment or have eligibility criteria, such as income-based assistance. Be sure to ask about additional costs, including cremation or aftercare services, which may not be included in the base price. Additionally, verify service details, as some options may have restrictions based on your pet’s size, health condition, or location.

While low-cost options are available, many pet parents choose in-home euthanasia to ensure a peaceful, stress-free farewell in the comfort of their home. If you're looking for a private, compassionate experience, we’re here to help.

She walked us through every step with such kindness and made sure Leila was comfortable, peaceful, and surrounded by love.

> After making the difficult decision to help our elderly bulldog cross the rainbow bridge, we found CodaPet online, offering in-home euthanasia. Our dog was a large breed and could hardly walk, and I couldn’t bear the thought of transporting her to a cold clinic for her final moments with us. Dr. Michelli arrived at our home and was so kind and gentle with our sweet girl; she explained to us how things would work and gave us time to answer any questions. We were so thankful to be able to say our final goodbyes to our fur baby in the privacy of our home and with her in the comfort of her own bed. Our hearts are broken by the loss, but I couldn’t have wished for a better way to have gone about this experience. Thank you, Dr. M and CodaPet. 🙏🏻🌈

> Lily was our first family dog and I never knew how much love our little pup would give us and how deeply & quickly she became a family member. It was the hardest thing in the world to see her go but so peaceful to say our goodbyes at home with her. Dr Ann was so compassionate as she explained the process and answered all our questions. She has a soft spoken, caring & calming demeanor which I believe Lily picked up on. Lily hadn’t moved from the floor all day but when Dr Ann sat near her, she got up, wobbled over to her & sat between her legs for the remainder of her time with us. I believe she knew Dr Ann was there to help her. Dr Ann was so respectful of our time with Lily. I would HIGHLY recommend Dr Ann. She brought peace to our breaking hearts.

> Dr. Gonnering was wonderful. My BellyAnne immediately took an interest in her with wagging tail. I believe BellyAnne knew that Dr. Gonnering was there to help her cross the rainbow bridge and be well again. Thank you Dr. Gonnering...I will recommend you to anyone that needs these services, Jacquie Tromer in loving memory of BellyAnne

> Dr. Angela was great. She was extremely supportive and caring. Putting my baby down was the hardest thing I have ever done in my life, but I was extremely satisfied with the process and wouldn’t change a thing about how it went.

> Dr. Gonnering helped make a very difficult situation a little better. She was very kind and compassionate to us and to our dog. She talked me through what to expect ahead of time and again when she arrived. She gave us the space we needed to say goodbye and we were able to comfort our dog the entire time.

> Using CodaPet was so easy; from searching for a vet near me to clear pricing. Once booked they remained in constant communication with me throughout the process, providing time updates, etc. Our family was matched with Dr.Kelsey Jones and I can not recommend her enough. She arrived promptly, listened to our concerns, examined our furbaby Ciddy and gave us ample time to grieve and make the final decision. At no moment did I feel pressured to rush. She gave us time to set up an area outside and spoke to us like a friend throughout the process, while treating all of us with respect and compassion. She even made a suggestion on how to allow our other dog to say goodbye (which I would never have thought of). It’s not an easy choice to let go of a beloved pet but i feel this was the best way to do it and highly recommend her services.

> Dr. Gonnering helped us twice in a span of three weeks. We had to put our sweet Fiona down after bone cancer slowed her down. A few weeks later we had to put our handsome Shrek down after learning he had a large mass on his spleen. It was very unexpected but Dr. Gonnering was so compassionate and made us feel better about our decision. We are so grateful to have had Dr. Gonnering during this difficult time.

> Dr Gonnering was fantastic. She explained the process in great detail and made sure I was comfortable with every step before it was taken along the way. I would highly recommend the in-home service as it allows your Pet and yourself to grieve in the comfort of your own home.

> We had a sudden need for home pet euthanasia for our beloved little dog, Jellybean. None of our local vets offered the service timely, so we had to try an unknown. I found CodaPet online and there were appointments available. Dr. Gordon at CodaPet was wonderful. The whole process went smoothly. Communication was thorough. She was a little late, but kept us updated (because you can't rush these things). She said all the right things and comforted us in our decision. We are heartbroken, but at least this part will be a good memory. Our pup was at home, peaceful, and not stressed out by being at the vet. We pet him, cried, told stories, and he just fell asleep. People who provide this service are special people. We SO appreciated being home for his final day. We would not hesitate to recommend Dr. Gordon if you unfortunately need this service.

> Words cannot express our gratitude and appreciation for the service that Dr. Mays and her company provided to our family. If and when the time comes to make that hurtful decision, Dr. Mays and the Coda company are the best to consider. Thanks once again for helping my family & me ease through this transition. Phd

> I am so thankful for Dr. Ann Gonnering. She was able to help our family through one of the hardest days as we lost our cat Sir. Dr. Gonnering was kind enough to meet us exactly where we were, which was laying in bed surrounding sir. She sat on our bed and explained the procedure in detail, allowed for questions, and was patient. She was very calm and reassuring and allowed us to move at the pace we felt comfortable with. Sir passed very peacefully and with dignity and I will never be able to say thank you enough for that. I can’t imagine ever having to go through this at a vets office. Dr. Ann Gonnering was very communicative and kind throughout the whole process. All of the details were coordinated by them which helped make the process easier. The crematorium they used was incredible - a very loving family that runs the business. THANK YOU!

> Dr. Orth was wonderful! She responded very quickly, which seemed like a miracle for us. She was very thorough and kind with our distressed older cat. She quickly assessed our cat Ronnie and agreed it was time. She explained what she would do and what would happen. She was very gentle and kind with our pet. She arrived totally prepared and acted to calm Ronnie and make the visit as comforting as possible. We can’t say enough good things about her professionalism and kindness to our pet and my husband and me. It’s very clear she loves animals. We would highly recommend her to help your cat in Sanger, CA area.

> We put our cat down at home a few weeks ago. The Dr was very caring and kind. She allowed space for my kids to process how they needed. She let them gather around however they wanted. She walked us through each step of the way. I highly recommend.

> Dr. Stadler was incredibly kind, compassionate and professional. She made an unbearable situation as positive as it could be under the circumstances. Our beloved dog was treated with the utmost dignity and respect. We are extremely grateful that she was willing to come as early as possible on a weekend. I would highly recommend this service for anyone facing this difficult decision.

> Dr Gonnering was very sympathetic and professional. We have two other dogs we wanted present and she handled them well to calm them and introduce herself. She has a very sweet presence and I feel my dogs were all relaxed around her . My youngest was a little cautious of her but ultimately took to her. I'm very grateful for the situation, to be able to do this in the comfort of home. Having a gentle, loving vet is key and I couldn't ask for better. Thank you CodaPet and Dr Gonnering!
