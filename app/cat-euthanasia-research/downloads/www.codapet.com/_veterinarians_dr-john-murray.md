About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

As a veterinarian, my passion for animal, and compassion for both pets and their families led me to pursue a career in veterinary medicine since I was little. My desire to provide the utmost comfort and support during difficult times prompted me to specialize in in-home euthanasia services. By offering this compassionate and personalized approach, I want to ensure that pets and their owners receive the care and safety they deserve during their final moments together.

> 100% recommend Dr. Murray. On such a hard day for our family, he was very understanding, comforting and communicative both before and during the appointment. He was able to make our cat's passing as comfortable as possible. We are so grateful we were able to have this procedure done at home without the typical going-to-the-vet stress.

> Dr Murray was incredibly kind and compassionate. He was very patient and understanding with what we were feeling and he asked us about our little guy’s favorite things. He explained everything and was very gentle with my sweet boy. He was able to pass peacefully at home with his family rather than at a vet office which he never liked. Thank you Coda Pet and Dr Murray.

> Dr. John Murray made the process as painless and peaceful as possible. Our cat, who was normally shy and skittish of new people (including vets) was brushing up against him and letting Dr. Murray pet him, which says a lot to me. It was clear that our little guy was not stressed out by the process, and his passing was as peaceful as we could have hoped for.

> Dr John Murray was so sweet & kind. He took his time to love on our Nova girl before having to put her down. He waned to know what she was like growing up & hear her story. Meanwhile, my other dogs were trying to distract him and one kept bringing him a toy. I will recommend Dr Murray to my friends and family & I’m sure I’ll need him again one day. Thank you for everything Dr! Keep up your wonderful work. I know it cannot be an easy job to do :(

> Jessi did an amazing job helping us schedule our appointment. She helped make a very overwhelming task such a breeze. Communication was above and beyond from the scheduling till before and after our visit with Dr. Murray. I can’t express enough praise and gratitude for how kind and amazing Dr. Murray was in helping our Axel boy crossover the rainbow bridge. I have been blown away by how peaceful Axel was able to pass away licking peanut butter, enjoy his favorite treat. I highly recommend everyone to give their beloved pet this final gift of a smooth transition.

> Dr. John is one of the most compassionate humans I’ve ever met. He is gentle and kind and understanding and is very respectful of your time and space and needs. I’ve had to out many pets down over the years and this was by far the “best” experience. He spent time with us and loved on our dog and asked all about her life and genuinely cared about our situation and our dog! He didn’t rush us or the process and was very supportive of us and showed such kindness even while doing something so hard.

> I've had many pets and I'm always there at the end, and I've always found vets to be compassionate. Dr. John Murray though is amazing. He took the time to ask us about Patch, how long he'd been with us, what his favorite things to do and eat were. Then between the sedative and the final injection he took his time to make sure everything was prepared correctly. He took a paw imprint and nose print while we watched. After the final injection he put a bandage over the injection point - such respect for our Patchy, and such compassion that I've never seen in a vet before. He then gave us time with Patchy before he left. He is such a kind and considerate person.

He let me take my time and also gave me time with her after she had crossed over. Very kind and stress free and my cat went peacefully. I highly recommend Codapet.

His dedication to care for pets and grieving family truly makes him remarkable. Dr. Murray held my baby Onyx and cared for him with such gentle love. His patience while my family and I mourned the loss of our fur-baby was soothing. His professionalism and empathy is unmatched. Thank you, Dr. Murray.

> Making the difficult decision to help a pet pass is not an easy one, but I am ultimately grateful I was able to coordinate at home pet euthanasia for my beloved kitty. I have no doubt in my mind that allowing for my cat, Owen, to pass in his favorite place, where he was most comfortable, was the right choice given these heartbreaking circumstances. Dr. Murray was incredibly patient, kind, knowledgeable, compassionate, and communicative. I could have not asked anything more of Dr. Murray, he was so caring during a devastating time. I am grateful for this option and the excellent care we received through CodaPet.

He was incredibly compassionate, patient, and took the time to explain every step with a calm and soothing presence that truly helped put us at ease. What meant the most to us was the way he handled Onyx—with such tenderness, respect, and love. It brought us comfort during one of the hardest moments of our lives. We can’t thank Dr. Murray enough for the dignity and care he gave both Onyx and us during this heartbreaking experience.

> Dr Murray was by far the most compassionate veterinarian I’ve ever had the pleasure of meeting. He came to our house on a holiday weekend allowed us to lay in the back yard with our pup and take as much time as we needed before saying goodbye. He sat with us listening to stories and laughing at the silly things our Scooter did throughout his life. When the time came Dr. Murray slipped away, tears in his own eyes until we were ready for him to take our baby. He came back over cute basket in hand tucking our boy in with such care. He took care of the cremation and followed up after. When the time comes again that we have to say goodbye to another baby we will without a doubt use CodaPet. Thank you Dr Murray for giving Scooter the best send off a pup could have!

He took paw and nose prints before Patch passed and was caring to a degree I’d never experienced from a vet before. I highly recommend Dr. Murray.

> Mac was my first pet- my kitty cat of 18 years. I consider myself very fortunate to have had him as a buddy for so long. So when he showed signs of his time being up, I knew from a friend -in home pet euthanasia- was a peaceful goodbye. Dr. John Murray was beyond thoughtful and professional with amazing bedside manner. Mac had a wonderful last day at home and I held him in my arms as we said goodbye. It was beyond hard, but I also wouldn’t have it any other way looking back. Mac hated his car carrier, the car, a vet office is so cold. We were in our beautiful, sunny room, comfortable and well, I’d want to go the same way! Thank you again for being so wonderful to our sweet baby.

> This was my first experience with putting down a dog. In this case my Mylo. Dr. Murray had this calm collected energy when he came in and respected all my wishes of wanting to do it in my backyard. His presence kept me calm and relaxed even though it was one of the hardest things I have had to do in my adult life. I honestly wouldn’t have stayed so calm. He was informative and didn’t rush the process in the slightest. I got to give my Mylo a huge slice of chocolate cake right before he fell asleep. I definitely would recommend Dr Murray for any future dog owners. I can see why he does what he does & he truly cares about your pet & the owners. One of a kind!

> I want thank Dr. Murray for the kindness, tenderness and compassion he showed towards our Clover and each family member. This was such a difficult and heartbreaking decision to make with so many mixed emotions reaching it. Having the option of having him come to us really helped us because Clover didn’t enjoy car rides and going to the vet was very upsetting. To be able to spare her all the stress and anxiety in her final moments and to see her slip gently pass in her own home was the best possible way to handle the passing of a much loved family member. Even as she left, she looked peaceful and asleep gently tucked in under a blanket. Lastly I want to praise him for the tactful way he handled the billing and discreet way he left his business card without intruding upon our grief. I have already spoken to friends about the care quality of his work. This must be a difficult job to perform but Dr. Murray has a genuine natural gift which he performs so well. I’m glad it was he who came to us.
