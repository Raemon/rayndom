Dawn earned her Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Pennsylvania in 2000.

## Dr. Renee Schott

Licensed Veterinarian, 16 yrs experience

(0) reviews

I believe that every pet deserves a "good death"—one that is as peaceful and filled with love. My journey to becoming a veterinarian was actually driven by this specific mission: to provide a stress-free, pain-free transition for animals in the place where they feel safest. I grew up on a hobby farm in a small town south of Green Bay, Wisconsin. My very first pet was a chicken, and they still hold a special place in my heart! After graduating from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2009, I spent time in Chicago practicing emergency and exotic medicine, caring for everything from dogs and cats to reptiles and birds. Later, I served as the Medical Director for the largest wildlife rehabilitation center in the world. In that role, I managed the care of over 22,000 animals a year. It was there that I truly found my calling. I dedicated myself to refining euthanasia protocols, focusing on how to give even the most high-stress wild animals a calm and dignified passing. And then educating others in the field on how to do this. Because I am also a life coach, I approach every home visit with a deep sense of empathy and authenticity. My goal is to ensure your pet’s final memory is one of comfort and home, honoring the beautiful bond you’ve shared until the very last moment. When I am not helping families, I am often still teaching, writing, or helping wildlife. For my own "recharging," I enjoy the quiet of nature, the vibrant energy of live music, and spending time with my own feathered and furry friends

I grew up in rural Pennsylvania and, like many of my colleagues, I have loved animals since I was very young. That naturally grew into a desire to practice veterinary medicine where I could care for both pets and the people who love them. I moved to Ohio to attend Cedarville University, where I earned my bachelor’s degree in 2007 and went on to attend The Ohio State University, where I graduated with my Doctor of Veterinary Medicine in 2012. After several years in mixed animal practice, I transitioned to relief veterinary work as we started our family and had little kids in the house. During that season, I also enjoyed serving as a clinical year mentor for veterinary students at the University of Arizona. Now that our kids are a little older, I am providing in-home end-of-life care for pets. When not working, I enjoy spending time with my husband and our four wonderful kids. We also share our home with our two dogs - Tucker, our senior Havanese, Teddy, our young Whoodle (who is being trained to work as a therapy dog but still has too many zoomies to do that just yet!), and a menagerie of chickens and ducks.

## Dr. Caitlin Klepper

Licensed Veterinarian, 9 yrs experience

(12) reviews

I'm a dedicated veterinarian with a strong passion for animals and their well-being. With 9 years of experience in veterinary services, I have honed my skills and expertise to provide top-notch care to dogs and cats. My primary focus is on delivering compassionate and personalized veterinary services to pets in the comfort of their own homes, particularly specializing in in-home pet euthanasia. Growing up on a Pulled Hereford farm in Lambertville, NJ, I was fortunate to be surrounded by animals and the animal care industry. My mother worked as a veterinary technician, and my father was involved with an animal pharmaceutical company. This upbringing immersed me in the world of animals from an early age. Alongside my hobbies of rhythmic gymnastics, ballet, and active participation in 4-H, I developed a deep appreciation for the unique bond between humans and animals. When the time came for college, I attended Clemson University, where I pursued a Bachelor of Science degree in Biological Sciences. It was during my time at Clemson that I also fell in love with football, further broadening my interests and experiences. Following my undergraduate studies, I moved to Kansas, where I had the privilege of spending time with my two living great-grandmothers. It was there that I delved into the public health program at Kansas State University while simultaneously preparing to pursue a career in veterinary medicine. In 2016, my dedication and hard work paid off when I received my Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) degree from Kansas State University. Equipped with a strong foundation and a burning passion for animal welfare, I embarked on my journey as an associate veterinarian just outside Kansas City. Over the course of six fulfilling years, I cultivated a deep appreciation for surgical procedures and the unique connections formed with clients and their beloved pets. In 2022, I made a life-changing decision to relocate to Iowa, where I established my own business. This endeavor allowed me to provide relief veterinary services to local clinics while also fulfilling my heartfelt commitment to offering in-home pet euthanasia services. It brings me great satisfaction to bring comfort and peace to pets and their owners during these challenging times. Beyond my professional life, farming holds a special place in my heart. I currently reside on a hobby farm, where I share my life with a variety of animals that have become cherished members of my family. I enjoy spending time outdoors, engaging in activities such as hiking, fishing, and hunting. During moments of relaxation, I find solace and creative expression in crafting, particularly through knitting. Among my personal pets are three delightful dogs—Jolene, Trace, Ketch and Jazz—who provide endless joy and companionship to me and my family. Additionally, our four cats—Rosie, Oliver, Brat Cat, and Rooster—warm our hearts and keep the farm rodent-free. Our diverse poultry, including peafowl, ducks, and guineas, bring life and entertainment to the farm while contributing to its ecosystem. The friendly Gotland sheep not only have lovely personalities but also provide lambs and fleece every year, adding to the farm's vibrancy. For me, veterinary medicine is not just a profession but a true calling. It brings me immense happiness to care for animals and contribute to their well-being. Knowing that I am making a positive impact in the lives of both animals and their human companions is what drives me each day. With my extensive experience, genuine love for animals, and unwavering commitment to providing the best veterinary care, you can trust that your beloved pets will receive the utmost compassion and expertise under my care.

Dr. Beau Bradbeer—better known as “Beau the Vet”—was born in the Snowy Mountains of Australia and grew up surrounded by animals of every kind, thanks to a wildlife-rescuing mum and a family heritage steeped in horsemanship. After graduating from the University of Queensland in 2008, she built a career in emergency and specialty veterinary medicine and eventually made her home in the U.S., becoming a proud American citizen in 2024.

## Dr. Steven Silberman

Licensed Veterinarian, 38 years yrs experience

(2) reviews

I was raised in Opelika, Alabama and attended Vanderbilt University as an ROTC midshipman for the navy, and then Auburn's College of Veterinary Medicine, graduating in 1987. I was the founding and first veterinarian at the Emergency Pet Hospital in Naples, Florida in 1993 and Belmont Animal Hospital near Charlotte in 2000. On 01/01/01, I married a fantastic gal in Nevada (Diane from Pennsylvania), who I had met when treating one of her rescues in the middle of the night in Florida in 1997. We settled in North Carolina as a midway point between our hometowns, built a clinic and started our family. Some health challenges ended my second stint as a practice owner and by 2005, I found myself back in Diane's home town helping to raise our two daughters in Pottstown, PA. I live on an old, small farm in northern Chester Country and my services on behalf of Codapet will be based from there. For fun, I play guitar and sing to the animals until they run off. Since 2008, we have been providing a full spectrum of medical, surgical and dental services at The Affordable Spay Neuter Clinic in Pottstown, PA, which was established below Diane's Pet Supplies and Adoption Center, for pet families who have found that modern veterinary care was no longer financially accessible. When we opened ASNC, over 5 million dogs and cats we being killed in "shelters" in our country every year. The biggest reason for the killing has always been the cost of pet ownership, including sterilization surgery. We had to help. Our tiny clinic ultimately performed over 24 thousand low cost surgeries and dental procedures before closing in early 2025, due entirely to my own accumulated wear and tear. Since we have found no one with the skill set or inclination to continue this mission in our basement surgical clinic, I "retired" and ASNC is sadly no more. The demand for affordable care remains great. Along the way, we photographed many of the surgery cases and unusual animals treated at ASNC since 2008. There was frequently no other clinic that would say yes and we tried hard to never say no. Treating critters for licensed wildlife educators was a bonus and it is always great fun to try and provide medical care and not get eaten, butted, constricted or impaled. Much of it is still on our Facebook/affordablespay page if you would like to see some of our adventures in Pottstown. My legendary wife, Diane Dietch, has rescued and adopted over 15 thousand pets into good homes through her non-profit adoption center since 1989. We both were deep in the trenches of animal rescue many years before it was fashionable and Diane is still there through Diane's Pet Rescue (https://www.ddpets.com).

Dr. Courtney Mills understands that saying goodbye to a beloved pet is one of the hardest moments in a pet parent’s life. After earning both her undergraduate and veterinary degrees from Cornell University, she began her career in general practice in San Diego, where she discovered her passion for end-of-life care. She found that supporting families through difficult decisions and providing peaceful, in-home euthanasia was the most meaningful work she could do. In 2024, Dr. Mills, her husband, and their 13-year-old border collie mix, Delilah, moved to Jacksonville, Florida, to be closer to family—and to let Delilah enjoy her golden years in the sunshine. She is honored to help Jacksonville families navigate their pets' final moments with love and compassion.

In 2020, she transitioned fully to end-of-life care, ensuring that pets could pass peacefully in the comfort of home. She believes that euthanasia, though heartbreaking, is one of the greatest gifts we can give our pets—a final act of love and kindness.

Licensed Veterinarian, 23 yrs experience

(52) reviews

Originally hailing from Tucson, Arizona, Dr. Andrea Dover is a seasoned veterinarian who graduated from the Kansas State University School of Veterinary Medicine in 1999 (or, as her students jokingly tease, "before the turn of the century!"). Her veterinary journey has been diverse, encompassing two distinct phases. In the first half of her career, she embraced the adrenaline rush of emergency medicine. Later, she transitioned into the role of educator, imparting her knowledge to future veterinarians and veterinary technicians. Throughout her veterinary odyssey, one aspect has consistently touched her heart—performing in-home euthanasia, providing comfort and solace to both pets and their families. Dr. Dover currently resides in the countryside, sharing her home with a horse, a llama, and a dog named Peanut. Throughout her veterinary career, Dr. Dover has found her greatest fulfillment in supporting animals and their owners through the sensitive and emotional journey of end-of-life care. Her passion for hospice work has spanned over a decade, and she considers it a profound honor to facilitate a peaceful and pain-free transition for beloved animal companions. Beyond her professional life, Dr. Dover is an avid enthusiast of horseback riding, international travel, and live music events. Her animal companions include Aura, a 25-year-old Arab/Quarterhorse Palomino, who may be a retired senior citizen but still keeps things interesting with his Dennis-The-Menace moments. Larry the Llama is Aura's constant companion, and they share an unbreakable bond. The true star of the Dover household, however, is Peanut, a terrier/Maltese rescue from the humane society. Peanut is convinced that everyone he meets is a friend and exists solely for his entertainment. Dr. Andrea Dover considers it a privilege to offer support to families and their beloved companions during the poignant and significant end-of-life transition.

Dr. Lutri, originally from Argentina, South America, has always been passionate about animals. As a child, she remembers drawing a picture of herself with a little dog on a table, wanting to help it. After completing six years of vet school abroad, she pursued her dream of becoming licensed in the United States. Since graduating, Dr. Lutri has been practicing as a general practitioner and relief doctor, providing assistance to hospitals around the LA/OC area. In 2020, Dr. Lutri completed her DVM education from ECFVG, after earning her degree from the National University of Rio Cuarto in 2004. A few years ago, she faced the difficult decision of euthanizing her own beloved pet after it was hit by a car. This experience gave her a deeper understanding of the sorrow and pain that pet parents go through when making the same decision for their furry friends. Dr. Lutri's empathy towards animals and their families led her to begin offering in-home euthanasia services, where she can provide support to pet owners during their pets' last moments. Unlike the appointments at busy hospitals and clinics where time is limited, Dr. Lutri's in-home services allow her to give support throughout the process. When not practicing veterinary medicine, Dr. Lutri enjoys spending time with her family, especially her husband, and daughter. They love to go on weekend getaways together. After losing her beloved pet almost two years ago, Dr. Lutri and her family are preparing to adopt a new furry friend. Lastly, Dr. Lutri is also fluent in Spanish, allowing her to communicate effectively with Spanish-speaking pet owners and provide them with quality care for their beloved pets.

So when he showed signs of his time being up, I knew from a friend -in home pet euthanasia- was a peaceful goodbye. Dr. John Murray was beyond thoughtful and professional with amazing bedside manner. Mac had a wonderful last day at home and I held him in my arms as we said goodbye. It was beyond hard, but I also wouldn’t have it any other way looking back. Mac hated his car carrier, the car, a vet office is so cold. We were in our beautiful, sunny room, comfortable and well, I’d want to go the same way! Thank you again for being so wonderful to our sweet baby.

> When our French bulldog Roxen was diagnosed with Stage 5 IVDD and could no longer walk with in a matter of two days and was in extreme pain even with the meds our vet had given us to the point where I could not even move him without him yelping in agony, we had to make the difficult decision to put him down in a short time frame. It was not an easy decision and was even harder being over the weekend with our normal vet not being very helpful to us in our opinion. So after doing research and looking around at places that could do it, my mom told me of a friend of hers that had gotten an in home euthanasia. At the time I had never heard of it and I had never had to be the one to put a family pet down, so I looked around at a couple of different places on the internet after a google search. Most websites made it more difficult to schedule a time for a vet to come and visit, but with codapet.com it was actually very user friendly. So on Sunday morning after having a rough night with our beloved roxen, I set the initial appointment up for the first available for my area which was on Tuesday. Within moments I received emails and texts confirming the appointment. Dr. Schmillen reached out to me after reading our story of what had been happening to our boy Roxen and said that she could come sooner if we needed. At the time we were still thinking about going to an emergency vet place we had never been where we were going to have to move Roxen who yelped in pain whenever I tried to move him, so when she said she could come sooner I asked if she could come the same day and she said yes. She came within a few hours and was very respectful and understanding about what was going on and explained the whole process to our family. Her coming to the house on such short notice really shows how much she cares for pets and their families that have to go through this difficult time. She helped make this hard decision for us a little easier and words cannot express how grateful we are for her and the service they provide. Being able to be in your home and having your beloved pet be surrounded by all of their loved ones including our other dog Jax was a blessing. The whole process took a couple of hours and it was much easier for him to be laid to rest in his favorite bed surrounded by us instead of being on a cold table in a strange place with only a few of us being with him. I will suggest this process to everyone I know and I will only do it this way if I ever have to do it again (although I am hoping I never have to again). Dr. Angela was very kind to the whole family and took her time. She helped us and our young daughter (12) understand everything that was going on and made the whole process a little easier. I cannot say enough how grateful we are for her and the service they provide.

Our Radley had gone down fast over the last month and we had an appt scheduled for a Friday morning. He woke up the Wednesday before, which happened to be New Year’s Eve, and couldn’t hardly walk. Seemed like a stroke or something of that nature. I sent a video to Dr. Mays and asked if there was any way she could come that day. She checked her schedule and worked with us so that our sweet boy didn’t have to suffer much longer. She came out early afternoon on New Year’s Eve and helped us ease our sweet Radley across the Rainbow Bridge. We are forever grateful for her professionalism, kindness and empathy.

I appreciated that, especially since it was a lethal one for a very loved family member. We never felt rushed or pressured one way or the other. I just wish there were people doctors who were as attentive, kind, compassionate, and laid out the various options to their patients.

> Dr. Schmalz is calm and patient in all that she does. She's gentle and helps answer any questions every step of the way. My dog greeted her with curiosity and Dr. Schmalz just let Bella sniff and explore until she was comfortable. My dog selected her special place for her last moments, and Dr. Schmalz accommodated that without question. It was important to me that my other dog be present and that worked out well. We never felt rushed in any way.

> We had to say goodbye to our pup Leo, who we had for 16 years, and it was one of the most painful things I ever had to do. Leo had advanced kidney disease and his health quickly deteriorated. We had scheduled a Coda Appointment with Dr. Derecka Alexander for a Tuesday, but Leo’s health took a turn for the worse on a Sunday. I emailed Coda Pet to ask if there was any possibility any Vet could come out sooner. Dr. Alexander immediately contacted me and made herself available in our time of need. We were so appreciative of Dr. Alexander’s compassion and kindness in helping our beloved pup Leo cross over the rainbow bridge, especially after it became urgent. She made a very difficult experience of us having to say goodbye to our pup more manageable. We chose to get a Vet to come to our home for our final goodbye to our Leo because we wanted him to be surrounded by the warmth of our love, the comfort of his family, and the smells and sounds he has always known. I wanted his last memories to be of us — his family — holding him, kissing him, thanking him. Thank you, Dr. Alexander, for allowing us to provide that to our pup Leo.

> Dr Mary was truly kind and compassionate during our appointment. We ended up having to schedule the visit sooner than we initially expected as our senior kitty got rapidly worse. Nothing about that day was easy, but everything was taken care of for us so we just got to be there for our companion. Dr Mary walked us through every step of the process, making sure we and our senior kitty were comfortable the whole time. I am so grateful we were able to say goodbye at home, where our kitty felt safe, and get those precious extra minutes with him.

The experience was very peaceful for Meadow; she was home and on her favorite couch blanket in her final moments, surrounded by love and care. Dr Sarah took the time to ask about Meadow's story, how long we had her, and really connect with us before helping us say goodbye. We'll call CodaPet when our next senior is ready to cross the rainbow bridge.

Our sweet cat was able to cross the rainbow bridge in the comfort of his home without the stress of being moved to a vets office in his final hours. She even brought his ashes back to us. I can't thank her enough for this. We also had to move his appointment up and she was quick to move to his needs. I hope I don't need their services for a long time for my other fur babies but I will use her again in the very, very distant future.

No words could ever describe how deeply caring, thoughtful and understanding she was throughout the whole entire process. I cannot possibly thank her enough for making our sudden and heartbreaking goodbye as peaceful as one could ever hope for.

> There are no words that fully capture the gratitude I feel for Dr. Daniela Lutri. During the most heartbreaking moment of my life, she showed up with an incredible amount of compassion, patience, and gentleness. She treated my sweet Harley with such dignity and respect, and she treated me with kindness when I was completely broken. Dr. Lutri took the time to explain everything, never rushed a single step, and made sure Harley was comfortable, peaceful, and surrounded by love. The calm presence she brought into my home made an unbearable situation feel just a little more humane and a little less terrifying. Saying goodbye to a soul dog is devastating, but knowing Harley passed quietly, pain-free, and in my arms is something I will forever be grateful for. Dr. Lutri gave us the gift of a peaceful goodbye, and that is something I will carry with me for the rest of my life. I cannot recommend her enough to anyone facing this impossible decision. She truly does this work from the heart.

From the moment she came to my house, her calm presence put everyone at ease, including my dog. She was professional, yet spoke as if she had known Avery for years. She gave us as much time as we needed to say goodbye to our baby without feeling rushed. After Avery passed, Dr. Noe gave a heartfelt speech and hugged us all. I couldn't imagine having to euthanize in any other way.

> I cannot express enough the gratitude I feel for Dr. Lisa Feig. It was heart wrenching knowing I had to say goodbye to my precious Dottie before she began to suffer. We loved her so much. With that said, Dr. Lisa Feig made the experience so much easier and peaceful for our sweet girl. I knew Dottie was not in pain and crossed over in the most peaceful way. Dr. Feig is the most compassionate, caring, thoughtful doctor anyone could ask for. Anyone who has Dr. Feig in their life as wife, mother, daughter, friend--is an extremely lucky person. She was so giving of her time and patience. I recommend at home euthanasia to everyone. Having your loved one home, comfortable in their surroundings is really the best option. I hated the idea of her being at a hospital or vet clinic in a sterile environment. I got to hold her and tell her how pretty she was and how loved she was. And all the while, Dr. Feig demonstrated such genuine compassion. My fiancé and I were blown away. It takes a special person to do this type of job. And Dr. Lisa Feig more than meets that requirement. A million thanks to her and Coda Pet.

> I’m truly grateful for CodaPet’s service in helping us schedule a qualified veterinarian on the same day. After assessing my cat’s quickly declining quality of life, being able to arrange a timely appointment was a bittersweet relief that ensured we didn’t prolong his suffering. Dr. April Le Blanc arrived on time and immediately put us at ease. She took the time to understand our cat’s condition, introduced herself to him gently, and answered all our questions with compassion. With over 30 years of veterinary experience—and as a parent to many of her own pets—her empathy and expertise were evident in every step of the process. Although saying goodbye to my dear cat was heart-wrenching, I’m grateful that his passing was peaceful and that I could be right beside him, doing everything I could to keep him at ease. Having the service done at home allowed our other cat to be present, which we hope helps her understand his passing. Dr. Le Blanc gave us all the time we needed afterward and offered heartfelt comfort during an incredibly difficult moment. I’m deeply thankful for her kindness and professionalism. I highly recommend Dr. April Le Blanc and CodaPet for anyone needing compassionate end of life care for their pet. She also followed up with grief-support resources, which I truly appreciate.

> We're so grateful for the experience we had with Dr. Thomas when we had to say goodbye to our senior cat, Maica. It was incredibly painful to see Maica suffering from rapidly increased symptoms of her advanced kidney disease, and we weren't expecting to have to say goodbye to her at the time we did. Dr. Thomas was deeply empathetic and kind with both us and Maica, and during our appointment she gave us plenty of information and time to process both the procedure and Maica's passing. It means the world that we could spend Maica's final moments with her, making sure she felt safe and loved until the end. I would recommend Dr. Thomas to anyone who unfortunately has to make this difficult decision, and even though we miss Maica deeply, it helps to know she was shepherded on with such care.

> We suddenly found ourselves in an unbearable situation with our 17-year-old dog, Teddy. His health declined so quickly, and we had to rush to find someone who could help us say goodbye at home. Thankfully, we were able to book an appointment with Dr. Lisa. She came to our house with such humility, patience, and compassion. She listened as we cried and asked a million questions, gently reassuring us that we were doing the right thing for our sweet boy. She never rushed us, she gave us the space and time we needed to say goodbye. As heartbreaking as it was, Teddy passed peacefully and comfortably in our arms. Dr. Lisa treated him with love, dignity, and respect, and made sure he was safely transported for cremation. She even followed up with us afterward to reassure us he had arrived where he needed to go. Losing Teddy has been one of the hardest things we’ve ever gone through, but we have no regrets choosing Dr. Lisa. She gave our boy the most loving, gentle passing we could have hoped for.

> The form for the service was very easy to complete. I appreciated this since making this decision was very difficult and I was fraught with emotion. I wanted my beloved cat Buddy to have a pain free transition at our home. He was 18 years. His decline was rapid; he became extremely ill in the span of a week with advanced kidney disease. Dr. Lutri was so gentle and loving to Buddy. She explained every step of the process and asked me before each step if I was ready to move to the next. Dr. Lutri was gracious, kind, and compassionate. She has the most peaceful, calm, loving presence and a profound caring for the pets she serves and their pet guardians. She comforted me greatly as she took care of my magnificent boy. She genuinely understood the magical connection I had with Buddy and treated him so tenderly when she put his sweet body into a beautiful bed to transport him the the crematorium. I felt like Dr. Lutri was an angel sent to me in my dire time of need and loss. She was exceptional in every way. She is a talented doctor overflowing with empathy and understanding who is beautiful inside and out.

> Saying goodbye to our beloved dachshund Lily was one of the most painful moments of our lives, but thanks to Dr. Lisa Stadler with CodaPet, it was also one of the most peaceful and compassionate. Dr. Lisa, a retired veterinarian, brought a gentle presence and deep empathy into our home—qualities that made an unbearable day a little more bearable. Her kindness and professionalism helped guide my wife and me through the process with grace and dignity. We are overwhelmingly grateful that Lily was able to pass in the comfort of her home, surrounded by the space and the things she loved most. Holding her in my arms as she went peacefully was a blessing I will never forget. The communication with CodaPet was seamless, and scheduling the appointment was simple—something I deeply appreciated during such an emotionally difficult time. I cannot recommend CodaPet and Dr. Lisa more highly. Their service was not just professional—it was personal, compassionate, and deeply respectful. Thank you for being part of Lily’s journey, and ours. You will forever hold a place in our hearts.
