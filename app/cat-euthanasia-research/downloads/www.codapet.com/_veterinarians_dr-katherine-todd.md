Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I became a veterinarian to make a meaningful difference in the lives of animals and their families, offering comfort, healing, and support through every stage of their journey. I chose to offer in-home euthanasia because I believe it provides the most compassionate, stress-free way for pets to pass in familiar surroundings, surrounded by love.

> She was very kind and understanding of the situation. She gave us plenty of time for us to say our goodbyes. She didn't treat Camry just like another number and that means a lot.

> Faced the difficult decision to euthanize our beloved 18 year old Papillon and used Codapet to do it in our home as our dog hated to go to the vet. Dr. Katie Todd arrived and explained in detail the process, gave us plenty of time to say our goodbyes, and made the process as easy as possible. She was very reassuring to my children that we had made the right decision and explained all the options for taking care of the remains and provided us with keepsakes to ease the family’s pain. Thank you so much Dr.Todd in doing what has to be one of the world’s toughest jobs!

> I am so glad to have found CodaPet - At Home Euthanasia. My wife and I knew we didn’t want to take our sweet Pomeranian to the vet for the final time since we knew it would make her nervous as it had in recent visits. After years of being on medication the dosage kept increasing and unfortunately our dogs heart condition had progressed so much it just wasn’t helping anymore. Her health declined rapidly within three days and we knew our hopes and options were coming to an end. I got online hoping to find a vet that could come to the house and make it as comfortable as possible. I made the first available appointment online with Dr. Katie Todd and within just a few minutes she reached out and contacted me. When she came to the house she was very professional, calm and explained the process before doing anything. Although it broke our hearts to say goodbye our sweet girl passed peacefully and is out of all the pain. I definitely recommend CodaPet and Dr. Katie Todd for in home pet euthanasia over taking your pet to the local vet.

> Dr. Katie was amazing! She handled everything so professionally yet personally too. Ruger will be so missed by many (as she can attest to, she said it was the biggest crowd she'd had, there were 9 of us) and I will never take my pets to a cold impersonal clinic to pass if I can help it. Having your pet pass at home where they're comfortable and familiar was such a blessing!

> Dr. Katie Todd came to my house on a Saturday night at 8pm, after having worked all day. My original appointment was to be Sunday morning at 845AM but she asked if I would like her to come that night. She came and explained the process which I know all too well, but this was the first time having this done at my house. She was so very kind and listened to a man who could barely speak at times without crying. I was able to just lay down with my cat and talk to him as he drifted off to sleep. She also made a set of pawprints for me to keep. I cannot thank her enough for what she did for me and my cat, Buddy. I am forever in her debt. She has a heart of gold to be offering this in home service. It costs more than the traditional vet but it is so worth letting your pet pass peacefully at home, not somewhere that they probably never liked to visit in the first place. Dr Todd will certainly be my first choice when I have to make this difficult decision again. Thank you so much Katie.

> Dr. Todd was nothing less of incredible. From the moment we booked her services; she sent a text to confirm the appointment and to let her know if we needed services quicker to let her know. The morning of, she sent a confirmation text and even let us know when she was on her way. She has a wonderful demeanor; and everyone was comfortable with her. She explained the process to us; answered all of our questions and even got a paw print for us. I could not ask for a better provider to help our beloved pet transition over the rainbow bridge. I will always recommend her; and if the need ever arose again, I will be using Dr. Todd again.

> Dr. Todd came to my house on Saturday night at 8pm to euthanized my cat Buddy. Original appointment was scheduled for Sunday at 845 AM. Dr Todd texted me to see if she needed to cone sooner. I told her that would be better although Buddy would have been OK until the next morning Dr Todd explained the process to me as this was my first in home euthanasia experience despite having put many dogs and cats to sleep at a vet. Buddy absolutely hated going to the vet so I was not going to do that to him. He died peacefully at home I would say if you can spend the extra money for in home euthanasia, its money we'll spent. I am forever grateful to Dr Todd for coming to the house sooner than what was scheduled. I will certainly request her again when needed. Thanks again Dr Todd

> Dr. Todd was very kind and gentle with our little Peanut, and respectful of our grief. She carefully explained everything that would happen and gave us as much time as we needed to be with him before and after. She made his passing much more peaceful for him, especially since she came to our home so he didn't have to experience another trip to the vet's office.

She stated that Dr. Katie Todd took her time with the procedure and she stayed with my mother for a time afterwards She was also very sympathetic to the situation.

> Dr. Katie Todd was highly recommended to us. Our 18 year old shihpoo had been struggling with rapidly declining health. I can vividly remember bringing Lilly home at 8 weeks old and spending 18 years of pure joy with her. It was a wonderful honor to get to be her Mommy. That little girl was my primary sidekick and we had a ball together. She was right there with me throughout everything good and bad that life threw our way. When her little body became to tired, I knew that I wanted to make sure that her time was as perfect as it could be for her. I wanted to make sure that Lilly had a calm and peaceful transition. Dr. Katie Todd provided just that for us. She made herself available to us on a Sunday evening and came to our home. Dr. Todd was so kind and soothing. She calmly explained everything to us prior to and as she was administering the medications. Dr. Todd has a very difficult career watching people grieve so terribly but also being so helpful in such a time of need. It takes a very strong person with a tremendous heart to be able to accomplish that. We are so grateful for her and that she provided our beautiful Lilly the opportunity to pass peacefully in the comfort of her own home while be held in her Mommy's arms. Thank you Dr. Todd for being there for us.

> I really appreciate the time Katie spent answering my texts prior to Yogi passing. She helped me feel sure of the decision to euthanize and helped me feel comfortable knowing when it was the right time. Ironically, Yogi passed away naturally while I was signing the forms the day he was to be euthanized. Katie had just arrived less than 5 minutes before. She offered to perform post-death care and paw prints, but we opted to do that ourselves. Even though we ultimately didn’t require her services, her kindness and knowledge of what was happening really helped us get through a very sad time. We would recommend Katie to anyone faced with the same difficult situation.

> It's the service you never want but when it comes I was so thankful for Dr. Todd. She was so compassionate and patient with us. Our sweet cat was able to cross the rainbow bridge in the comfort of his home without the stress of being moved to a vets office in his final hours. She even brought his ashes back to us. I can't thank her enough for this. We also had to move his appointment up and she was quick to move to his needs. I hope I don't need their services for a long time for my other fur babies but I will use her again in the very, very distant future.

> I cannot express how grateful I am for the exceptional care and compassion Dr. Todd showed when she came to our home to help our beloved dog. She was not only a skilled veterinarian, but also an empathetic person. She treated our furry baby with the utmost gentleness, ensuring he was comfortable in his final moments. She took time to explain everything, answered our questions and did not rush us through our saying goodbyes. Her professionalism, warmth, and understanding made an incredibly painful experience more bearable. Thank you, Dr. Todd for being there for us when we needed it the most. Lastly, thank you for the beautiful keepsakes that we will cherish forever! You are truly amazing!
