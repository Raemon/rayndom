Providing a safe and beautiful experience not only for the pet but also the family that has loved them so is crucial to a dignified way of saying goodbye.

> It doesn't get any better than Dr. Marlene Anschultz. I've had 3 horrid experiences with at-home euthanasia that haunt me to this day. I don't want to use anyone else for this process than Dr. Marlene. Ever. She was genuine. She sat on the floor with us in the kitchen where our pet was comfortable. She talked to us. She talked to our cat. She asked questions about our life with him. We laughed and we cried. We were at ease from the moment she walked in. Dr. Marlene's time with us was gentle, kind, understanding, and patient. Not only did she explain the procedure in detail, she gave us time to process what she was saying. She answered questions. She asked us questions. She explained the disease progression in understandable language and why, because of what was happening, that there was kindness in letting him go. The time Dr. Marlene gave us to say our final goodbye was without limits. No pressure. No frustration. No looking at her watch. In a time of heart-wrenching pain and grief, we were comforted by a real person, not stock verbiage or fast-food procedure. I'll never forget it, and I'll be eternally grateful.

> Dr. Marlene is one in a million. Our 15 year old Tibetan Terrier had Canine Cognitive Dysfunction. She came to our home and was calm , sympathetic , and professional . She has a way that makes a person feel ok in such a terrible situation. She did not rush us . She explained in detail how and what to expect during the process. She gave us as much time as we needed to spend our last minutes with “ Bentley “ . You could not find a Veterinarian better to help you through this horrible part of life. We will be forever grateful to her . The Steve Shulman family

> Dr. Marlene was really amazing. She did a thorough examination of our Xena and reassured us that we were doing the right thing. We had to make the very unexpected decision to have our baby cross the rainbow bridge and she offered amazing support and kindness while we grieved. She explained the process very well and kept us updated every step of the way. She was also so great with our toddler and was so very patient and helped to include him in the process which was so meaningful. Having to say goodbye to our baby was one of the hardest moments of our lives but being able to do it at home with our child and other dog there was worth every penny. I highly recommend CodaPet and Dr. Marlene.

> Dr. Anschultz was sent to us from an angel. Our dogs diagnosis was so sudden and we were shocked to have to even make this decision so quickly, but she shared a very similar personal story and assured us that we were doing the very best thing for our dog. She is kind, compassionate, and one of a kind.

> Dr. Marlene was everything I didn’t know I needed. She is compassionate and wonderfully kind. She made my family so comfortable to be vulnerable in our final moments together. She walked us through the process and took the utmost care of my girl and my heart. I can never thank her enough for granting us the opportunity to send Pepper home with such grace and dignity. From the bottom of my heart, thank you.

> Dr Marlene was absolutely amazing to work with. My fiancee had never used the service before (I have twice with Dr Whala) and she was very impressed with how gentle, caring, and lovely Dr Marlene was with her cat Issy. As usual, nothing was rushed and Dr Marlene took the time to explain the process before going forward. After it was completed she did a quick check that further confirmed her decision to let Issy go peacefully, as she had more tumors thatn the two that she knew of. She wrapped Issy up beautifully in a lavender blanket and placed her in a little basket to leave. Cannot recommend this service highly enough.

> I am so grateful that we chose Dr. Marlene Anschultz for the very difficult decision for our beautiful Luna. She was extraordinarily caring and did not rush us. She gave us time to be with her, and to allow our other dog to see and understand. Dr. Marlene Anschultz not only saw to Luna's comfort to this time, but really ours as well. I have made this decision many times in my life, and in my young years, I worked for a veterinarian and was present when others had to make this choice as well. This is never easy, but this experience was one of the most peaceful I have been able to experience because we were able to do it at home and Dr.. Anschultz' calming presence helped us through. I will forever be grateful to her--and I truly will never forget her kindness.

She goes above and beyond and truly cares and wants what’s best for the pet and the pet owner. Anyone who somehow finds her when they are having to face the most difficult part of owning a pet are so lucky. She treats the family and the pet with the most respect and compassion, She is truly an angel to me.

> Our near 15 year old pup, Jack, left us just a few weeks ago. We met Dr Marlene three years ago when she came to our home to euthanize our girl, Shawni (Jack’s mother). Because of her gentle manner and obvious expertise with Shawni, we specifically asked for her for Jacky who she skillfully gave the same calm release from his last weeks dealing with nasal lymphoma. She was extremely supportive (patient!) with us too, giving as much time as we needed to finally let Jack go. She’s gentle with an empathy that seems she’s always known our boy and what he’s meant to us. Bravo, Dr Marlene, keep up the amazing good work you provide for all deserving animals.

> We are so grateful that Dr. Marlene Anschultz helped us say goodbye to our Milton. Dr. Anschultz was available the next day, which was imperative to fit our need. As soon as she arrived, she exuded calm and care. She sat with us through the procedure, answering any and all questions. She also listened, as we spoke through tears, to our regrets that we may have waited too long. Ultimately, Dr. Marlene Anschultz was an angel - and we are so thankful for her service.

She was so comforting and knowledgeable during my boy's transition, and we felt at peace knowing he was in compassionate hands. Her patience and calm helped us through a really devastating day, and we are so grateful to have found her and Codapet. We even received a beautiful note several weeks later - so thoughtful and kind. Thank you, from the bottom of our hearts, for what you provide to pet parents!
