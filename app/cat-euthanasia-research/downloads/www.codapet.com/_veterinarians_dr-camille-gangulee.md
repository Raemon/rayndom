Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

Growing up, animals were always part of my world - we raised chickens and had several dogs in the Philippines. I remember spending countless hours exploring the outdoors, fascinated by the creatures that shared my backyard. When we moved to the United States, it wasn't until my 16th birthday when we adopted our family dog Dimples. She became my closest companion, especially at the height of my teenage years when my anxiety had peaked, with her unconditional love bringing a calming energy to my life. Soon after, we adopted a Chihuahua, my sister adopted her own dog and next thing I know family gatherings became that much more joyful with our furry family members. It was during these early years that I developed a deep-rooted passion for caring for animals. As I grew older, this passion only intensified. I found myself drawn to the complexities of animal anatomy and behavior, eager to understand the inner workings of these remarkable beings. The idea of applying my knowledge to improve their health and well-being became a driving force in my life. After careful consideration, I decided to pursue a career in veterinary medicine. The path was demanding, but the reward was clear: the opportunity to make a tangible difference in the lives of animals and their human companions. I was eager to combine my love for animals with my scientific curiosity, using my skills to diagnose illnesses, perform surgeries, and provide compassionate care. Today, as a veterinarian, I am humbled by the trust placed in me by pet owners and grateful for the chance to make a positive impact on the lives of animals. I am committed to staying at the forefront of veterinary medicine, continuously learning and adapting to ensure the best possible care for my patients, especially at the end of their lives. I want to provide in-home euthanasia to pets because it allows me to offer a compassionate and dignified end-of-life experience for beloved companions in the comfort of their own homes. I witnessed firsthand during those first few years out of school how this service minimizes stress for the pet and their family during a difficult time, enabling them to say goodbye in a peaceful and familiar setting.
