Dr. Lisa Fieg was very accommodating and compassionate while providing in-home euthanasia services for my rapidly declining Basset Hound. She came out the same night after hearing that my dog was experiencing seizures. I highly recommend her for anytime one has to euthanize their pet and wants to have it done at home.

Dr. Ross was kind and compassionate when it was time for us to let our beloved cat, Luna, go. She examined Luna and confirmed that she was very ill, which helped my son and husband accept what we needed to do for Luna. Dr. Ross explained each step before and as she performed it, and she never hurried. Luna's passing was simple and peaceful. We couldn't have asked for a better vet to help Luna at the end.

## Pet euthanasia and cremation pricing in Los Angeles, CA

### Reservations and payments

Your credit card is required to reserve your appointment. However, no payment is required until the appointment and nothing is due until the appointment is completed

### Cancellation policy or pet passing

We charge cancellation fee of $100 if an appointment is cancelled less than 4 hours before the start time. If your pet passes away before your appointment you would not be charged a cancellation fee. If the vet you scheduled is able, and you would like their assistance with cremation, then pickup fee would apply instead of euthanasia fee

## Other Consideration

### Large Animals

If you have a larger pet, your vet may need the help of one friend or family member. Talk to your vet about options and limitations when they reach out to you prior to your appointment, and they will inform you of any extra cost for your situation. 

### How do I get my pet’s ashes

Options for your pets return home and memorabilia depend on your local provider. Your vet coordinate the return of your pet’s ashes and let you know if there are additional fees for urn delivery. 

### Special factors affecting price

Extra time or medications needed can affect the total price. Other factors can be if it is decided that it’s not time to euthanize your pet after the vet has arrive. In that case, only the travel fee, platform fee, and a quality of life consult would apply. 

## FAQs

### What’s included in the total cost?

The total cost includes the in-home pet euthanasia service fee, any travel fee (if any apply), and a platform fee. Additionally, depending on your choice, fees may apply for cremation services or keepsakes.

### Will the vet take my pet with them after the appointment?

During your appointment, your vet will confirm your aftercare selection with you. If you choose to arrange cremation services, your vet will oversee your pet’s transportation to a local facility for cremation. If your preferred cremation option includes the return of your pet’s ashes to you, your vet will discuss the process to reunite you with your pet's ashes and the anticipated time frame during your appointment

### Will the vet examine my pet once they get to my home?

Yes, upon arrival the veterinarian will assess your pet. This can look different than an “nose to tail” examination in a clinic setting and will focus more on the pet’s history and quality of life.

### What if I am not sure it is time?

It is not uncommon to have doubts about whether the time is right. If you’ve taken the Quality of Life Questionnaire and are still unsure, we recommend consulting with your family veterinarian before scheduling an appointment.  
  
Rest assured, if you book an appointment, your in-home euthanasia veterinarian will let you know if they do not believe that euthanasia is appropriate at this time.

### How long will the procedure take?

You can expect your veterinarian to be in your home from 20-60 minutes, depending on how much of that time you need or want throughout the process.

### How does at-home pet euthanasia work?

At-home pet euthanasia with CodaPet’s network of veterinarians provides loving, end-of-life care when you need it most. Once you schedule a visit online, you will receive a confirmation, and your vet will make sure everything is arranged with care and clarity.

When your vet arrives, they’ll begin with a gentle assessment to reassure you of your decision and answer any questions you may have. Your vet will always move at your pace, giving you the time and space you need to say goodbye in your own way.

When you are ready, your vet will gently administer a sedative so your pet can relax and drift into a deep, peaceful sleep. After the sedation has fully taken effect, a final, humane medication is given, allowing for a calm and painless passing surrounded by love.

If you choose aftercare, your vet will respectfully care for your pet and transport them for cremation, handling every step with dignity and compassion.

### How much does at home pet euthanasia cost in my area?

At-home euthanasia with CodaPet’s network of veterinarians in Los Angeles and the surrounding areas begins at around $500. Your final cost may vary based on your pet’s size, your location, and any additional services you choose—such as private or communal cremation, ashes returned in an urn, or personalized keepsakes.

When [scheduling a vet visit](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment/) to your home, you’ll first receive a detailed, upfront price estimate according to your specific needs before confirming a visit. If you have questions or need support at any point, you can call (213) 529-0126.

If you’d prefer to speak with someone, you can always call (213) 529-0126.

### How do I tell if my pet is suffering?

Signs your pet may be suffering include chronic pain, difficulty breathing, loss of appetite, inability to stand or walk, or a loss of interest in daily activities. These symptoms could indicate a decline in their quality of life. You know your pet better than anyone, but speaking to a veterinarian can help you assess whether euthanasia is the most compassionate option. If you feel you need more help, you can read our guide on ‘[How will I know it’s time](https://www.codapet.com/how-will-i-know-when-its-time)’, take a [quality of life assessment](https://www.codapet.com/quality-of-life-scale), or call customer care at (213) 529-0126.

### What should I do if my pet is declining fast?

If your pet's health is declining rapidly, it’s crucial to take the following steps:  


  * **Consult Your Veterinarian** : Schedule an appointment to discuss your observations and any scoring from a quality-of-life scale. This information can help guide the conversation about your pet's condition and options moving forward. Your vet may suggest palliative care, hospice, or, if necessary, euthanasia.  

  * **Ensure Comfort** : Create a quiet, cozy space with soft bedding and easy access to food, water, and a litter box (if applicable).  

  * **Minimize Stress** : Keep routines simple and familiar, and limit loud noises or disruptions.  

  * **Offer Gentle Care** : Provide soothing touch through gentle petting and offer favorite treats if they can still eat.  

  * **Consider At-Home Euthanasia** : If appropriate, discuss the option of at-home euthanasia with your vet for a peaceful and familiar passing.  

  * **Reach Out for Support** : It's okay to lean on loved ones, pet-loss support groups, or counselors to help navigate this difficult time.



  
If you're noticing signs of declining health, we encourage you to use our [quality of life scale resource tool](https://www.codapet.com/quality-of-life-scale) to evaluate your pet's condition before your vet visit.

### What is the difference between in home pet euthanasia and euthanasia at a vet clinic?

The key difference is the setting. In home euthanasia allows your pet to pass peacefully in the comfort of their familiar surroundings, reducing stress and anxiety. This option especially benefits pets who may feel scared or uncomfortable traveling to a clinic. It also offers your family a private, intimate experience during this emotional time. While some urgent situations don’t allow for time to schedule in-home euthanasia, many pet owners in Los Angeles choose in-home services for the peaceful atmosphere and compassionate care their pets receive right where they feel safest. You can [find flexible availability](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment) for our local vets here, or look for [same-day euthanasia](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request) appointments.

### Will my pet experience any pain during euthanasia?

No, pet euthanasia at home is designed to be completely painless. After an initial end-of-life assessment, your veterinarian will first administer a sedative to ensure your pet is relaxed and comfortable. The euthanasia medication then gently stops the heart without causing pain. The process is peaceful and allows your pet to pass without distress.

### Do you provide 24-hour pet euthanasia services?

While we do not offer 24 hour pet euthanasia services, we do provide after-hours and emergency care in greater Los Angeles. You can request [same-day and urgent appointments](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request) to ensure your pet receives the compassionate care they need during critical moments.

### Is there an additional fee for after-hours or emergency services?

Yes, there is typically an additional fee for after-hours or emergency appointments. You can view the estimate when you request a [same-day or urgent appointment](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request).

### Is the cost of euthanasia for dogs and cats the same?

Most providers in Los Angeles charge a flat fee for euthanasia, although some providers do charge based on the size of your pet, so small dogs and cats can be the same price; however, medium or large size dogs (such as Bulldogs, Australian Shepherds, Labradors, or German Shepherds) will likely carry a higher price. At CodaPet, most vets charge a flat fee for both dogs and cats; however, if there is a large pet fee, it will be applied automatically for you to review in the price estimate when you reserve an appointment. You can view the detailed [pricing and availability here](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment) or call us at (213) 529-0126.

### What should I expect during an in home pet euthanasia appointment?

During an in home euthanasia appointment, your veterinarian will make an assessment of your pet’s health and quality of life to provide guidance to ensure your decision is informed. The veterinarian will administer an initial sedative or anesthetic to help your pet relax and become pain-free, ensuring they are comfortable and at ease. In the last stage, your veterinarian will first ensure your pet is fully sedated before gently administering anesthesia which will quickly slow down your pet’s respiratory system until the heart finally stops beating. In most cases, this process takes less than a minute. Your veterinarian will always move at your pace so the process is as comfortable as possible for your pet and your family.

### Can I choose a specific veterinarian for my pet’s euthanasia?

Yes, you can always choose the veterinarian you prefer, at the times they have available to reserve. You can see their [real-time availability](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment) or request a [same-day urgent appointment](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request) if no time suits your needs.

If you have any questions or specific needs, please don’t hesitate to reach out at (213) 529-0126.

### Do you offer any quality-of-life consultations?

Yes, your local veterinarian offers in-person and tele-consults depending on availability for a separate fee. In order to reserve a time to speak with a local veterinarian, please call (213) 529-0126.

  
**Note** : This consultation is aimed at providing advice on end-of-life care and quality-of-life questions. Your veterinarian is not offering telemedicine and is not able to provide specific diagnosis or treatments. If you have any medical needs, please visit your primary care veterinarian.

### How far in advance do I need to make an appointment?

The notice for every veterinarian differs, however, most veterinarians require at least a 2-hour notice from the time you need them to arrive at your home. This allows them time to prepare and ensure they can provide the highest level of care and compassion for your pet. It also accounts for their travel time, as your veterinarian may be traveling from many different locations around Los Angeles.  


While you can request a [same-day and emergency services](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request), it's always best to contact us as early as possible to ensure availability and to give both you and your veterinarian time to prepare for this important moment.

### What should I expect in terms of my pet’s behavior during the pet euthanasia process?

During the euthanasia process, your pet will be gently guided to a state of peace and comfort. After a sedative is administered, you can expect them to become calm and relaxed, free from any pain or distress. When the final injection is given, your pet will slowly drift off into a deep sleep before passing away peacefully. Your compassionate veterinarian will ensure the process is as gentle and serene as possible, allowing you to be present with your beloved companion in their final moments of love and care.

### Can I be with my pet during the euthanasia process?

Yes, during the in home euthanasia process, you are encouraged to be with your pet throughout the entire process. Being there provides comfort and reassurance to your pet as they pass peacefully.

### How do I know when it’s time to consider euthanasia for my pet?

Every pet is different, and you know yours better than anyone, however, it may be time to consider euthanasia when you notice more ‘bad days than good’. It’s important to keep an eye on your pet’s quality of life and try to understand when it has declined, such as no longer enjoying activities or suffering from unmanageable pain. To help you understand their quality of live, you take a [Quality of Life Assessment](https://www.codapet.com/quality-of-life-scale), which helps you get a more a clear picture of your pet’s well-being at this point in time.

Remember, if you are unsure, speaking with your primary care veterinarian can help better understand your pet’s quality of life. It’s important to speak with your primary care veterinarian if you haven’t yet to understand your pet’s health. If you do not have a primary care veterinarian, consider visiting an urgent care or emergency hospital in your area.

### How should I prepare my home for my pet’s euthanasia?

Everyone’s experience in saying goodbye to their beloved companion is different and very personal. It’s important to consider that you know your pet best. Some considerations, however, are choosing a comfortable space where your pet feels safe, sometimes their favorite spot in your home. Another consideration can be to gather any family members who wish to be present and feel free to bring your pet’s favorite blanket or toys, etc that make them feel comfortable. When your veterinarian arrives they will guide you through each step in the process and help you move at your pace to ensure the process is as peaceful as possible.

### How long does the euthanasia procedure typically take?

In home euthanasia procedures usually take about 10-15 minutes, however, the total time can vary depending on the pace you and your family prefer to move at and your pet’s comfort level. Your veterinarian will take the time necessary to ensure you feel you have enough time to be with your beloved pet while also ensuring your pet is calm and relaxed before proceeding. In some cases, this may take longer, especially if your pet is anxious or uncomfortable.  


We understand that saying goodbye is a deeply emotional experience, and we encourage families to take as much time as they need during the process. Our goal is to create a peaceful and compassionate environment for both you and your pet.

### What should I do after the euthanasia procedure is completed?

After the euthanasia, you are welcome to spend as much time as you need with your pet to say goodbye. If you’ve chosen any cremation services to handle your pet’s body, your veterinarian will reconfirm your choices and gently transport your pet when you are ready. If you’ve chosen any keepsakes offered by the crematorium, like Claw Paw Prints, Ink nose prints, or other memorabilia, your veterinarian will reconfirm your choices before leaving your home. If you have any questions or want to change your mind about any of your choices, you can discuss your options with your veterinarian before they leave your home.

### What are my options for cremation?

After the in home euthanasia procedure, your veterinarian will provide you with time to say goodbye to your pet. Once you're ready, they will re-confirm the preferred aftercare option that you choose when reserving your time with your veterinarian. In Los Angeles you can select three types of cremation services:  


  * **Individual Cremation (Ashes Returned)** : An individual cremation is a process where your pet will be cremated separated with physical barriers in the chamber. This ensures the separation with other pets in the chamber so you may reunite with your pet’s ashes. Your pet’s ashes will be returned to you in an urn of your choice. If you choose an additional urn then your pet’s ashes will be returned in the urn of your choice.  

  * **Communal Cremation (No Ashes Returned)** : A communal cremation is a process where your pet is cremated in a chamber with other pets. Once the process is complete, the crematorium will respectfully scatter your pet’s remains among other pets. It’s important to note, you pet’s ashes will not be returned to you.  




Some of our veterinarians offer an additional option known as **Private Cremation (Ashes Returned)**. In this option, only your pet is in the cremation chamber, ensuring that the recovered ashes are solely your pet's. These ashes can be returned in an urn of your choice, with additional urn options available. To see if private cremation is available with your provider, please refer to our [booking page](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment).

**Note** : If you choose to leave your pet's body with your veterinarian, rest assured it will be handled with the utmost care, respect, and dignity. Your veterinarian will coordinate all aftercare arrangements as requested, allowing you to focus on yourself and your family after this difficult goodbye.

### How do I get my pet’s ashes back?

Your veterinarian will coordinate the return of your pet’s ashes before they leave your home. Your options include having your pet’s remains delivered by your veterinarian (for an additional fee), shipping them to you (for an additional fee), or picking them up from your primary clinic or the crematorium.

### Are there any low-cost or no-cost pet euthanasia solutions?

Saying goodbye to a beloved pet is never easy, and we understand that cost can be a concern for many pet parents. While we specialize in premium in-home euthanasia services, we also want to acknowledge that cost may be a concern. If you're looking for low-cost or no-cost pet euthanasia options in Los Angeles, consider reaching out to the following:

  * **Local Animal Shelters & Humane Societies** – Many provide low-cost or donation-based euthanasia services, often with cremation options.
    * **Golden State Humane Society  
** 555 E Artesia Blvd, Long Beach, CA 90805(562) 423-8406  

  * **Low-Cost Veterinary Clinics & Nonprofits** – Some vet clinics and nonprofits offer reduced-cost euthanasia, sometimes supported by grants or donations.
    * **Community Animal Medicine Project  
** 957 North Gaffey St.**** San Pedro, CA 90731(310) 574-5555  

  * **Animal Control Services** – In certain cases, local animal control agencies may offer euthanasia services for terminally ill or suffering pets at a lower cost.



**Note:** When considering a low-cost pet euthanasia option, it's important to call ahead to check availability, as some providers may require an appointment or have eligibility criteria, such as income-based assistance. Be sure to ask about additional costs, including cremation or aftercare services, which may not be included in the base price. Additionally, verify service details, as some options may have restrictions based on your pet’s size, health condition, or location.

While low-cost options are available, many pet parents choose in-home euthanasia to ensure a peaceful, stress-free farewell in the comfort of their home. If you're looking for a private, compassionate experience, we’re here to help.

> We had a sudden need for home pet euthanasia for our beloved little dog, Jellybean. None of our local vets offered the service timely, so we had to try an unknown. I found CodaPet online and there were appointments available. Dr. Gordon at CodaPet was wonderful. The whole process went smoothly. Communication was thorough. She was a little late, but kept us updated (because you can't rush these things). She said all the right things and comforted us in our decision. We are heartbroken, but at least this part will be a good memory. Our pup was at home, peaceful, and not stressed out by being at the vet. We pet him, cried, told stories, and he just fell asleep. People who provide this service are special people. We SO appreciated being home for his final day. We would not hesitate to recommend Dr. Gordon if you unfortunately need this service.

> We were referred to Dr. Lisa Fieg from CodaPet to perform euthanasia on our beloved golden Oliver. She was very aware of our pain and did everything she could to make it easy for us to endure it. She explained the entire procedure and confirmed that Oliver, based on her experience, was indeed in pain. She made us feel at ease, and to accept the fact that it was the best for him. The process was smooth and tranquil to everyone. It is always sad to say goodbye to a loved one, but Dr. Fieg made it a little less painful. If anyone is in a situation like ours with a beloved pet, Dr. Fieg/CodaPet will help you through the process of saying goodbye.

> Deciding to let our sweet cat, Toby, go was the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life. But it was clear his cancer was beating him, and there was nothing more we could do for him. We couldn't stand to see him suffer. I called "Codapet". The person I spoke with on the phone was so kind and considerate. She took all of my information, and thankfully, Dr. Lisa Fieg was able to come to our home that afternoon. She was very calm and gentle with our Toby. She explained the procedure well and made sure we didn't have any questions. We sincerely appreciated the time she gave us to hold him during the process. She even stepped out of the room, allowing us to be with him alone, after he passed. Everything went very smoothly and took about an hour. I had a friend who put her dog to sleep at home. She kept telling me it was a "beautiful experience!" I'm not going to lie. It wasn't "beautiful" to me. There was no way around it being anything other than a gut-wrenching experience. We were losing something we loved dearly! I cried so hard, I could barely see! I would have given an arm and a leg not to have needed to make that call that day! But, it had to be done. For that reason, this company, Codapet, and Dr. Lisa were a Godsend. I would highly recommend them to anyone facing an end-of-life decision for their pet. Everyone we came in contact with was sincere, respectful, beyond caring, and professional. Everything was timely and efficient, but never felt rushed or robotic. That day, 4/21/25, was our worst nightmare, but Codapet and Dr. Fieg made it the best that it could be. She got us through it and gave our sweet boy the comfortable release he needed, while he was held by two people who loved and adored him. For that, we are eternally grateful.

> Dr. Orth was wonderful! She responded very quickly, which seemed like a miracle for us. She was very thorough and kind with our distressed older cat. She quickly assessed our cat Ronnie and agreed it was time. She explained what she would do and what would happen. She was very gentle and kind with our pet. She arrived totally prepared and acted to calm Ronnie and make the visit as comforting as possible. We can’t say enough good things about her professionalism and kindness to our pet and my husband and me. It’s very clear she loves animals. We would highly recommend her to help your cat in Sanger, CA area.

> We had to make the incredibly hard decision to put our cat down, and Dr. Diana was truly wonderful. She was kind, compassionate, and never rushed us. She gave us the time and space we needed and treated our cat with such care and dignity. I especially appreciated that she brought a basket to carry our cat after she had passed. It was a small detail, but it meant a lot during such an emotional moment. I am very grateful for her gentleness and professionalism.

> We are so grateful to Dr. Sarah Clem for the calm, loving presence she brought into our home during such a difficult time. From the moment she arrived, we felt respected—not only in our home, but throughout the entire process. I didn’t even realize in-home euthanasia was an option, and I can honestly say the experience was as peaceful and comforting as it could possibly be. Her compassion made an unbearable moment feel gentle and dignified. We will always be thankful.

> Lisa is beyond empathetic and lovely. Caring , understanding and loving. She melted in with our family immediately and was able to share in our love for Sophie. For a very trying time and so very traumatic Lisa, gave each and everyone of us (even my daughter Dylan whom was on FaceTime) the most incredible and loving send off to my beautiful princess, boots with the fur, bucket, nation , nation wide, puff, puffinator..... We love you Sophie beyond measure. Much gratitude for Dr. Lisa Fieg.

> I have had loved and lost a lot of pets. This was the first time I used an at home vet. I couldn't have another traumatic experience embrazened in my memory. Both my cat and I loved Dr. Amanda. She is so kind and respectful and she values the love you two share. I highly suggest that if you are considering this option you let Dr. Amanda help you.

> Using CodaPet was so easy; from searching for a vet near me to clear pricing. Once booked they remained in constant communication with me throughout the process, providing time updates, etc. Our family was matched with Dr.Kelsey Jones and I can not recommend her enough. She arrived promptly, listened to our concerns, examined our furbaby Ciddy and gave us ample time to grieve and make the final decision. At no moment did I feel pressured to rush. She gave us time to set up an area outside and spoke to us like a friend throughout the process, while treating all of us with respect and compassion. She even made a suggestion on how to allow our other dog to say goodbye (which I would never have thought of). It’s not an easy choice to let go of a beloved pet but i feel this was the best way to do it and highly recommend her services.

> Making the decision to say goodbye to your pet is one of the most difficult things a person can do. Dr. Fieg was so kind and empathetic and helped me feel confident I made the correct choice for my dog. Using this service to have it done in my home made the whole thing so peaceful for my pup, I’m so grateful it was able to be done in that way. I highly recommend the service and I highly recommend Dr. Fieg.

> Dr. Clark could not have been a more kind, compassionate and patient veterinarian. He’s also very experienced and made what I expected to be a traumatic experience (in home pet euthanasia) as peaceful as it could be and I will be forever grateful for that. I felt awful that I waited a day or two too long before making the decision, but having Dr. Clark be the one to help us was the right choice. We’ll now be taking our other dog to his practice for care.

> Our cat had reached the untreatable senior age of 18, and it meant a lot to say goodbye from the comfort of his home instead of taking him to the vet, where his last experience would've been stressful and upsetting for him.

> Dr. Fieg was exactly the person we needed on such a sad day. She was extremely respectful and a calming presence throughout the whole process. She explained everything beforehand, even took the time to sit with us and our fur baby before she even got started. Our gal took a turn for the worst very suddenly but Dr. Fieg gave us all the time we needed to process and say goodbye. When it was time, she walked us through each step before she administered anything. It was hard to say goodbye but our baby crossed the rainbow bridge very peacefully. The entire situation was painful and heartbreaking but we can’t thank Dr. Fieg enough for creating a calm environment and making the process as smooth as possible for everyone.

> After making the difficult decision to help our elderly bulldog cross the rainbow bridge, we found CodaPet online, offering in-home euthanasia. Our dog was a large breed and could hardly walk, and I couldn’t bear the thought of transporting her to a cold clinic for her final moments with us. Dr. Michelli arrived at our home and was so kind and gentle with our sweet girl; she explained to us how things would work and gave us time to answer any questions. We were so thankful to be able to say our final goodbyes to our fur baby in the privacy of our home and with her in the comfort of her own bed. Our hearts are broken by the loss, but I couldn’t have wished for a better way to have gone about this experience. Thank you, Dr. M and CodaPet. 🙏🏻🌈

> Having my pet euthanized due to a diagnosis of stage 4 lymphoma cancer at 7 years 11 months was something I wasn’t ready for. My dog was so young and taken away from me too soon. Dr. Fieg was the best. She was very thorough and explain explaining the entire process and gave me as much time as I needed to be with my dog until his demise. My dog went very peacefully and is no longer in pain. It was very comforting to me seeing the process and being there for my dog till the end. I did everything I could for my dog and the cancer was just too much for him. Although I miss him on a minute to minute basis, I know that he is in a better place now. I would highly recommend.Dr. Fieg if and when it comes time to make that decision that you never thought you had to make. Thank you Dr. Fieg for being so thorough and respectful to my dog and my wishes.
