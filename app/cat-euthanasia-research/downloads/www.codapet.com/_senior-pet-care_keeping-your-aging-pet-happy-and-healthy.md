# How to Care for Senior Dogs and Cats: Keeping Your Aging Pet Happy and Healthy

Senior pet care is about proactive health monitoring and lifestyle adjustments. Aging pets benefit from more frequent veterinary visits, adjustments in diet, and a calm, safe home environment tailored to their specific needs.

## Key Takeaways

  * Senior pet care is about proactive health monitoring and lifestyle adjustments. Aging pets benefit from more frequent veterinary visits, adjustments in diet, and a calm, safe home environment tailored to their specific needs.
  * Daily comfort and Mental Stimulation Are Just as Important as Medical Care. Soft bedding, manageable exercise, and enrichment activities can dramatically improve quality of life.
  * Understanding when to make end-of-life decisions is a crucial part of senior pet ownership. Recognizing signs of discomfort and knowing when to transition from palliative care to peaceful euthanasia can help ensure a compassionate goodbye.



Just like people, pets go through many changes as they age. Gray whiskers, slower steps, and more naps are just the beginning. Whether you’ve had your furry companion since they were a puppy or kitten or adopted them later in life, caring for a senior dog or cat takes a special blend of compassion, vigilance, and proactive care.

In this guide, we’ll walk you through how to adjust to your pet’s evolving needs, covering:

  * Nutrition
  * Mobility
  * Healthcare
  * Comfort
  * Emotional well-bein



## **What Changes Happen as Pets Age?**

Dogs and cats are typically considered seniors around age 7 (for medium-sized dogs and most cats), though smaller dogs may not show signs of aging until closer to 10. As pets age, they can experience:

  * Reduced mobility and joint pain
  * Hearing and vision loss
  * Dental disease
  * Decreased kidney, liver, or heart function
  * Behavior changes or cognitive decline
  * Increased anxiety or restlessness



Recognizing and adapting to these changes is key to supporting your senior pet’s well-being.

## **Veterinary Care for Senior Dogs and Cats**

Older pets benefit from more frequent veterinary visits, ideally every six months. Regular checkups help detect early signs of disease, allowing your veterinarian to recommend targeted care.

Key Elements of Senior Vet Care:

  * Bloodwork and urinalysis to monitor organ function
  * Dental exams and cleanings
  * Pain management for arthritis or chronic conditions
  * Vaccination adjustments based on lifestyle and risk
  * Cognitive assessments for behavior changes or confusion



## **Adjusting Diet and Exercise**

A senior pet's metabolism, digestion, and activity levels change as they age. Diet and movement should evolve to reflect those changes.

### **Nutrition Tips:**

  * Feed a senior-formulated diet with lower calories and joint-supporting nutrients
  * Increase hydration, especially for pets prone to kidney disease
  * Use elevated food and water bowls to ease joint strain



### **Exercise Tips:**

  * Stick to shorter, more frequent walks for dogs
  * Provide low-impact playtime for both cats and dogs
  * Incorporate gentle stretches or massage for arthritic pets
  * Consider pet ramps for furniture or vehicles



## **Enhancing Comfort and Daily Living**

Simple home adjustments can help your senior pet move safely and rest comfortably:

  * Orthopedic beds to relieve joint pressure
  * Non-slip mats or runners on hardwood floors
  * Night lights to assist pets with vision loss
  * Warmth from soft blankets or heated pet beds



Also, be patient with accidents or confusion. These incidents are often signs of aging, not misbehavior.

## **Supporting Emotional Well-Being**

Aging pets may develop separation anxiety, confusion, or increased clinginess. Maintaining routines, offering companionship, and using enrichment toys or puzzles can help keep them emotionally engaged.

Some pets benefit from:

  * Soothing music or aromatherapy
  * Calming supplements (ask your vet)
  * Interactive toys to prevent boredom



Cats, in particular, require mental stimulation to counterbalance a more sedentary lifestyle.

## **When It's Time to Consider End-of-Life Options**

No one wants to think about saying goodbye, but it’s an essential part of senior pet care. If your dog or cat is no longer enjoying life, can't move without pain, or stops eating and engaging with you, it may be time to consider palliative care or humane euthanasia.

That’s where CodaPet can help.
