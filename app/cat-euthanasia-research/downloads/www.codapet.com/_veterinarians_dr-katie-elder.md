Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

When I was doing volunteer work in shelters, I once saw kittens die because they were too young to be on their own. There weren't enough resources to help them at such a young age, and I wasn't in a position to offer help or end their suffering. I wanted to be in a place where I could make a difference for the vulnerable. Now, I want to provide in-home euthanasia because it's a conclusion and a peaceful ending, and because there's a need for it where I live. In-home euthanasia gives pets a comfortable conclusion and offers their owners closure.

## What pet parents are saying

> Compassionate, kind, extremely professional. Was able to read the situation and meet our dog where he was snd his people where we were. Allowed us to feel our own emotions rather than assuming we would feel a certain way. Extremely respectful of our elderly dog and showed him love.
