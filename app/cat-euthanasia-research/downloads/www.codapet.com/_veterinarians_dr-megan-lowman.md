Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

Growing up I always new that I wanted to be a veterinarian. I do not remember ever considering another career. After graduating veterinary school I initially went into equine practice, and actually completed an equine surgery residency in Leesburg, VA. However, after having my daughter in late 2022, I knew I needed to change career paths. Providing in-home euthanasia allows me to provide personalized and vital care to owners and pets in my area while supporting a family-oriented lifestyle.

## Education

> Dr. Lowman was so kind and caring. Having never met our dog Caesar, she treated him just like he was hers. She talked to him lovingly and to us with so much respect and support. Dr. Lowman allowed us to take the time we needed to say our 'sorrowful good-byes'. Dr. Lowman answered ALL of our in-depth questions regarding the entire procedure, and explained what she was doing when and what Caesar was experiencing at that time. Caesar was sleeping so peaceful and snoring. We love and miss our Caesar dearly. I whole-heartedly recommend Dr. Lowman. God Bless her!

> Dr. Lowman was so comforting during our rainbow appointment for our dog Teddy. She was professional and friendly throughout the visit. I’ve been recommending Dr. Lowman and codapet to anyone considering their options. My family and I had a lot of closure and a big part of that is because of Dr. Lowman. Thank you again.

> Thanks to Dr. Lowman for coming to our house at 9pm to allow our sweet boy to pass in peace. He was over 14 years old and his health rapidly declined within 48 hours. I cannot recommend a better more respectful way than to allow your fur family to pass in their own home with family by their side. Thanks again.

> I was connected to Dr. Lowman through CodaPet and was so thankful she was the one to help us say goodbye to our sweet pup. I had called around a few other places and couldn't find appointments within the week. I was beginning to worry I'd have to take my dog to the vet instead, which would have been extremely distressing for her. Thankfully, I checked CodaPet and was able to get a next-day appointment with Dr. Lowman. It was the perfect amount of time for us to spend one last good day with our girl, but also soon enough that she did not have to be in pain for long. Dr. Lowman was kind, compassionate, and a great listener. She allowed me to tell her my dog's life story, ask questions, and quelled my fears and doubts about the process. She sent a sympathy card to us in the mail, which just meant so much during this tough time. I am so glad that I know between the time we said goodbye and the time she was taken for cremation, that she was in the best hands with Dr. Lowman. I could go on and on, but will just say there's no one else I'd have wanted to guide us through this difficult time. Very, very happy with CodaPet and Dr. Lowman despite the unfortunate circumstances we encountered them in.

> Dr Lowman euthanized my dog that I’ve had for over 14 years with such kindness and compassion. After I booked the appointment she contacted me to ask if I had any questions and helped talk me through my doubts. She went through a medical history to make sure I was making the right decision and helped me feel less guilty about it all. When she arrived, she was so calm and compassionate. My pet died peacefully in my arms and I couldn’t have imagined a better way for her to go. My heart is still broken but I’m so grateful for Dr Lowman for making the process easier.

> Dr. Megan Lowman was fantastic when I needed someone for an in-home euthanasia of my dog. She did a thorough assessment, listened to my concerns, and reassured me that I had made the right decision. Her calm, gentle demeanor was incredibly helpful during such a difficult time and she went out of her way to ensure the experience was what my dog and I needed - even allowing me and my other dog time to grieve together after the procedure. I hope to never have to do this again, but if I do, in-home euthanasia with CodaPet and Dr. Lowman will be my #1 choice!

Her bedside manner is unparalleled. She is extremely compassionate, sensitive, professional and reliable in a way that is a rare find these days. I strongly recommend her to anyone who is focusing on quality of life for their pet.

Before we sent Kisses (our senior cat) with her, she explained next steps clearly and patiently waited for any questions or concerns we had. She went above and beyond to make sure that we received Kisses ashes. Thank you so much, Megan. We are forever grateful for you and appreciate so much how you handled that moment for us.

> Dr. Lowman was so incredibly kind and peaceful during her visit. This decision was so hard for our family, but she reassured us we were doing the right thing for our dog. Having gone through this once before, it was exponentially better doing this at home, where our dog was comfortable and we didn’t have an audience. I know this must be a hard profession, but I’m so glad there are people like Dr.Lowman who can help us say goodbye without the added stress of a vet’s office or anxious pet.

> Charlie came to us back in 2013 from a friend in North Carolina. Since then, Charlie traveled the world with us until we settled in Virginia. By this time our little buddy was hanging on, but his body slowly started to fade until he was no longer able to move on his own. Sadly, when it came time to send our angle back to heaven, we turned to Coda Pet who sent us Dr. Lowman. I'll be honest... She is the definition of professionalism, courtesy, empathy, you name it. She was a godsend who was present in the moment, caring, and made the process feel seamless. There was no unnecessary conversation, no judgement, and she was very supportive of our decision given his condition. The entire process felt very genuine from the initial phone call to our interaction with Dr Lowman to picking up his remains. If I thought for a second that Charlie was going to somehow pull out of his condition, I never would have made the call, and they reenforced that sentiment. That if at any time we felt that this was the wrong decision we could pull out. So, all that to say I am so lucky to have had this experience made less tragic by the loving and caring and professional team at Coda Pet. We even got a handwritten card from Dr Lowman. I mean come on. They truly care about you, and it shows. ❤❤❤

> Dr. Lowman helped make a devastating time in our lives feel bearable. She was incredibly kind and sweet to us and our dog Charlie. She gave us time to say goodbye in a peaceful and loving way, the way our Charlie deserved. One thing that may seem small, but was very important to me in my grief, was that she told us when Charlie would be cremated, and when we could pick up his ashes. It was a comfort to have this information. We previously went through having to euthanize our dog at a vets office, and it’s odd some of the things that stick with you in your grief. One of those things for me was not knowing where my dog’s body was, or when or where she’d be cremated, and then waiting weeks for an undetermined date when her ashes would be shipped to our home. Dr. Lowman has a gift, she has a very special way with animals and people alike. We are so grateful that she was able to come to our home and help us say goodbye to Charlie.

> Saying goodbye to a beloved furry family member is never easy, and this was my first time so I didn't know what to expect. Dr Megan Lowman and CodaPet exceeded our expectations. We booked an appointment within 3 days, received upfront estimate for the cost of services, and a warm introduction from Dr Lowman to assist with any questions. Dr. Lowman arrived on time and was very professional but also warm and caring. She walked us through what to expect, gave our pup lots of treats and pets, and made sure she was comfortable. She gave us our space to say goodbye in the intimacy of our home and I cannot be more grateful for the experience. A few days later, we received a check in from Dr Lowman and the handwritten note that was so thoughtful I have it saved in my memorial of our beloved Lady. I've already been telling my friends and family what a great experience it was, given the circumstances. I would recommend anyone evaluating their pet's end of life care to book with CodaPet, especially Dr. Lowman. Thank you all again for your care during a difficult time.

> When the time came, it was an enormous blessing to have Dr. Megan Lowman administer at-home euthanasia for our beloved Labrador, age 13 years. On a five-star scale, we give Dr. Lowman 10 stars. This veterinarian is intelligent, compassionate and the consummate professional. Answered all our questions. Gave exquisite care to our dog. Showed us grace by letting us say goodbye, tearfully and mournfully. All of our friends loved our dog. After her passing, I told these friends that this cherished member of her extended family that our dog was granted a "beautiful death." All thanks to the extraordinary care of Dr. Lowman and CodaPet. That this old soul is at peace now gives us comfort. -Katherine & Tom

It was as beautiful and as peaceful a passing as I could have hoped for as I held him in his favorite spot by the fire in my arms. She was especially terrific with my other two pets, giving them space and time to approach and grieve. While we never want to lose a pet to cancer, Dr. Megan’s care at home was a gift. Thank you for your kind and gentle nature and the loving care with which you attend to the end of life. I highly recommend Dr. Megan and CodaPet services.

> It seems an odd thing to give 5 stars for an in home pet euthanasia service. But, from the care of the phone call and the event itself...it felt like another member of our family was helping us through this terrible time and celebration of our small dog's life. Ava dog was 15.5 when she passed and suddenly in a lot of pain. Dr. Megan Lowman opened up and added a 9pm appointment to her schedule to help our sweet Ava in her time of need. She was careful, caring, loving, soft spoken, informative, and patient. The back of her van was set up like a small, clean and beautiful little bed... to take our baby girl to In Memorial Pet Cremation Services (also, 5 stars...I can't say enough kind words) . She was attentive and must have listened to all of the emotional stories and nonsense I was saying...because she sent a detailed and very personal card a few days later that mentioned our family members' names and even personal details about Ava's life. Thank you, Dr. Lowman and the wonderfully caring customer service at CodaPet for making this transition as caring and loving as possible.

> CodaPet gave us a gift of peace and compassion during one of the most difficult moments of our lives. Having them come to our home to help our beloved dog Bella pass on was the best decision we could have made. From the moment we reached out, the process was handled with such care and professionalism, which made everything feel less overwhelming. The veterinarian was truly remarkable—so kind, gentle, and incredibly empathetic. She took the time to explain everything, allowing us to ask questions and never rushing us through the experience. Her demeanor was calming, and she treated our dog with the utmost respect and love, as if she had known her for years. Being in the comfort of our home made all the difference. Our dog was able to rest in her favorite spot, surrounded by the people who loved her most, rather than being in an unfamiliar clinic setting. It was serene and peaceful, exactly as we had hoped. CodaPet made this heartbreaking moment feel like a beautiful farewell and gave us the closure we needed. I cannot express how grateful we are for their kindness and expertise. If you are considering this service, I wholeheartedly recommend it. They provided more than care—They gave us a way to say goodbye with dignity, love, and peace. Thank you, CodaPet, for helping us honor our furry family member in such a meaningful way. ❤️🐾
