Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I chose my career because veterinary medicine lets me combine my love of animals with my love of science. Every day is a challenge. At-home euthanasia lets me provide pet owners with a hard-to-find service during a particularly delicate time of need.

> Dr. Perret was so wonderful through such a difficult time for me. He was so caring and fully attentive. Honestly it was the saddest and most beautiful thing at the same time. He was so gentle and calm with my sweet girl Betty . Highly recommend him.

> Dr. Perret was very kind as he helped my dear Abby-Jo cross the rainbow bridge. He took great care and compassion to explain the procedure and even though it was a sad day, it was made easier by his thoughtful and gentle professionalism. I couldn’t have asked for a better vet, and the fact that he came all the way to my home where Abby wouldn’t be scared or placed under any undue stress meant the absolute world to me. I highly recommend Dr. Perret.
