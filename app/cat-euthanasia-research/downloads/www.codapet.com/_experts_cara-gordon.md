# Dr. Cara Gordon

CodaPet Veterinarian

Dr. Cara Gordon is a dedicated veterinarian who proudly hails from the state of Oklahoma. She pursued her education at the esteemed Oklahoma State University, where she completed both her undergraduate degree and her Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine. Although she has also spent time in Texas and California, Dr. Gordon now considers Oklahoma her home, where she is committed to providing compassionate care to the beloved animal companions of the area. Dr. Gordon's passion for animals has been a lifelong journey that began at a very young age. Her deep love and curiosity for the animal kingdom led her to pursue a veterinary degree, and she is determined to use her knowledge to benefit the well-being of our furry friends. Dr. Gordon's goal is to offer the best possible care to pets, ensuring their health and happiness. Outside of her veterinary profession, Dr. Gordon finds solace in reconnecting with the great outdoors, indulging in horseback riding, and spending quality time with her loved ones. The sweet pup pictured was her best friend and loyal companion, her beloved beagle named Enzo who passed in 2024. With her commitment to compassionate care and her strong connection to Oklahoma, Dr. Cara Gordon is a trusted and caring veterinarian dedicated to the well-being of pets in her community.
