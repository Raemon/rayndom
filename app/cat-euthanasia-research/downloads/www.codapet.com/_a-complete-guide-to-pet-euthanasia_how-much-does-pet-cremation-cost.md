# How Much Does Pet Cremation Cost?

[Dr. Bethany Hsia](/experts/dr-bethany-hsia)

Saying goodbye to a beloved pet is hard. The preferred aftercare option of many pet parents is individual pet cremation because it allows families to keep their pets close, even after they've passed. 

## **Primary Factors That Affect the Cost of Pet Cremation**

The price of your pet’s [cremation](https://www.codapet.com/a-complete-guide-to-pet-euthanasia/how-does-pet-cremation-work) will depend on a few different factors, including the method by which your pet is cremated, its body weight and size, regional location, and more. Below we will discuss the factors as they relate to traditional flame-based cremation using high heat, as water based cremation or aquamation is not yet widely available. However, for readers that live in a CodaPet service area, you can get the most accurate estimate of what it costs to cremate a pet by using our [pricing estimator](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment).

## **Pet Cremation Method**

The first factor that affects the cost of pet cremations is the method of cremation. There are three main methods of pet cremation: communal, individual, and private. About half (52%) of pet parents on CodaPet choose private or individual cremation, both of which allow the crematorium to return your pet's ashes to you, while about one-third (29%) of pet parents choose group or communal cremation, which do not. The remaining one-fifth (18%) of pet parents self-handle cremation (please check local laws and regulations).

## **Communal Cremation: Your Pet’s Ashes Are Not Returned**

Communal cremation is the most cost-effective solution for pet parents as it allows for numerous pets to be cremated simultaneously. Communal cremation is done in a single chamber and results in the co-mingling of pets’ ashes. As a result, this method makes it impossible to gather a single pet’s remains and return them to the pet parent. Most crematoriums have a designated place where the ashes are respectfully spread, such as a memorial garden.

Pet parents that choose Group or Communal Cremation on CodaPet spend around $100 on average, but that ranges from $50 on the low side to $300 on the high side.

## **Individual and Private Cremation: Your Pet’s Ashes Are Returned**

Individual and Private Cremation both allow crematoriums to return your pet’s ashes to you, but there are important differences between the two:

**_Individual cremation_** is sometimes called partitioned cremation. This method involves the cremation of multiple animals in the chamber at the same time, but separates them by dividers or partitions. This way a pet’s ashes may be gathered together and returned to the family. However, there may be a small amount of co-mingling as the pet is not in the chamber completely alone. Not all facilities offer this service, but when offered it is a cost effective way to cremate a pet and have their ashes returned in the selected urn or scatter tube.

**_Private cremation_** means that your pet is the only one in the chamber during the cremation process. This ensures that your pet’s remains will be returned with little to no chance of co-mingling. Consequently, this method of cremation comes at a higher price to offset the extra cost to the facility.

Additionally, some crematoriums have an option for pet parents to be present in a grieving room during their pet’s aftercare. This gives families an additional opportunity to say goodbye, allowing for a moment of privacy before cremation.

As with individual cremation, after the private cremation process is complete the ashes are gathered into the urn of choice or a special tube for scattering.

Pet parents that choose Individual or Private cremation on CodaPet spend around $300 on average, but that ranges from $110 on the low side to $460 on the high side.

## **Pet BodyType**

Another factor that affects the pet cremation cost is the size and weight of your pet. Larger pets require more room and time in the chamber than smaller pets. Therefore, a larger pet will cost more to cremate than a smaller pet.

Additionally, different types of pets may take longer depending on the species. For example, turtles or animals with horns or hooves, like goats, will require more time in the cremation chamber.

However, no matter the size or species of your pet, pet cremation services are a worthwhile and dignified option for body aftercare.

## **Location and Additional Costs**

Other factors contributing to cremation costs are location and potential fees.

Just like any other services, pet cremation can vary in cost among providers. The region in which you live can have an effect on the cost of crematory services due to supply and demand. Furthermore, states and local governments can have stricter or more lenient regulations on when and how crematoriums can operate keeping in mind potential environmental impacts. All of which can lead to varied pricing.

Each crematorium is different and their arrangements for the return of ashes can vary. Some deliver the ashes back to the veterinary hospital for pick up, others allow pet parents to pick up ashes from them directly, or they may ship the ashes home and charge additional fees to cover such costs. Crematoriums may also offer facilities for memorial services or private spaces, all of which would affect the total cost.

## **Memorializing and Honoring Your Late Pet**

Finally, there may be additional services you wish to purchase when [memorializing](https://www.codapet.com/pet-loss-and-grief/pet-memorial-ideas) your pet. Each facility offers different options, and if your crematorium does not offer an item you would like, you can often find independent companies in your area or online who do. Some popular items include:

## Personalized or engraved urns 

Personalized and engraved urns are a great way to celebrate your unique pet. Instead of a standard urn, pet parents can customize an urn with their pet’s name, a loving quote, and other information about their pet.

## Specialized jewelry

Pet parents also have an opportunity to have some of their pet’s ashes added to jewelry made specifically to hold the ashes of a loved one. These jewelry pieces are often designed as necklaces or rings and can be a great way to keep your pet close to you.

## Decorative art pieces

Similar to jewelry pieces, ashes of a beloved pet can be incorporated into glass artwork such as orbs, hearts, or other blown glass shapes. They can also be placed into an hourglass to acknowledge cherished time with the departed or mixed into tattoo ink for a living art piece.

Losing a pet is hard, we understand how important they are and believe their last moments should be as peaceful and dignified as possible. If you are facing the end of your pet’s journey and would like to [schedule an appointment](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment) for euthanasia or aftercare, we would be honored to assist you and your companion.
