## What pet parents are saying

> Dr. Randolph went above & beyond for my dog Rocco & myself. This was an incredibly hard thing to go through and Dr. Randolph is such a caring and relatable person to where you will feel like he has known you & your pet your entire lives. Being able to say goodbye to my big guy in our home was incredibly important to me & I am forever grateful Dr. Randolph gave me the option of being able to do that. He collected special keepsakes of my dog. And he kept in close communication with me during the weeks leading up to having to say goodbye while my dog was In home hospice care. Thank you Matthew for everything you have done for my big guy and me. I know him & my husband are in Heaven together now and that brings me comfort.

> Dr Randolph was such a blessing. He helped us in the most gentle way help us let Teagan go. She was at peace being in her home while we grieved as a family in private. I will never forget his kindness. I am so grateful your company exists and I found you.

> Dr. Randolph made an urgent visit to help transition our Bless. Although letting him go was difficult, home euthanasia was a far better choice than the vet office. Dr. Randolph explained each step, was compassionate, and gave us all the time we needed to say goodbye. I highly recommend this service/vet. We are fortunate to have this service in South Georgia.

> Dr. Randall and his team showed exceptional compassion and professionalism during one of the most difficult times of our lives. He allowed us all the time we needed to be with our little man, McNabb, and treated him with the utmost care, dignity, and respect. From my very first call—when I spoke with a kind and understanding young lady—to the moment our sweet Buggie’s ashes were returned to us, every step of the process was handled with tenderness and grace. We are forever grateful for the compassion shown to our family and our beloved McNabb. I cannot recommend Dr. Randall and his team highly enough. — Keri from Valdosta
