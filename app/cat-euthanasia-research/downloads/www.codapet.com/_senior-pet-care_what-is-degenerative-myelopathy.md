# What is Degenerative Myelopathy?

[Dr. Gary Hsia](/experts/dr-gary-hsia)

A diagnosis of degenerative myelopathy isn’t the end—it’s a call to adapt. With therapy, support, and love, you can make every day count. Keep them moving, keep them comfortable, and most of all, keep them loved. 

## What is Degenerative Myelopathy?

Degenerative myelopathy (DM) is a chronic, degenerative disease that affects the spinal cord. It is usually seen in older dogs and leads to hind limb weakness, loss of coordination and ultimately paralysis.

## What are the Causes?

Degenerative myelopathy is primarily associated with a genetic mutation of the SOD-1 gene that hinders the ability for free radicals to be destroyed, thus damaging the cells of the spinal cord. Over time, as more of these cells get damaged, we see the onset of the disease. To a smaller degree environmental factors may also play a role.

## Clinical Signs and Symptoms

The clinical signs of degenerative myelopathy often start off mild, sometimes only affecting one leg, but will progressively get worse. It usually starts in the hind limbs and then progresses to include all limbs. Some common signs include:

  * Difficulty getting up and walking
  * Falling over easily
  * Hind limb weakness
  * Ataxia/ loss of coordination
  * Muscle loss
  * Paws knuckled over and nails scrapped up
  * Incontinence



## What Breeds Are Most Commonly Affected by Degenerative Myelopathy?

Degenerative Myelopathy is most commonly seen in older dogs with an average age of 8yrs old. It is most commonly seen in, but not limited to: German Shepherd Dogs, Boxers, Siberian Huskies, Chesapeake Bay Retrievers, Golden Retrievers, Bernese Mountain Dogs, Pembroke Welsh Corgis, Rhodesian Ridgebacks and Standard Poodles.

## How Do You Diagnose Degenerative Myelopathy?

There is not one specific test to diagnose degenerative myelopathy. It is suspected based on the breed, medical history, neurologic examination, and diagnostic tests to rule out other neurologic disease. Oftentimes, it is helpful to run other tests such as blood work, x-rays, MRI/ CT scans, and spinal fluid analysis to rule out other diseases such as intervertebral disc disease, hip dysplasia, arthritis, spinal tumors.

Genetic testing may also be helpful. It will determine if the dog has none, one or two copies of the SOD-1 genetic mutation associated with degenerative myelopathy. A dog with no copies of the genetic mutation is very unlikely to get the disease. A dog with one copy of the mutation, known as a carrier, has a less chance but may still develop the disease. A dog with two copies of the mutation are considered high risk for developing DM, although it is not a guarantee they will develop the disease.

## What are the Treatment Options?

Unfortunately, degenerative myelopathy is a progressive and fatal disease with no specific cure or treatment. Progression of the disease will eventually result in all limbs affected and inability to stand, walk and oftentimes both urinary and fecal incontinence. Some treatments are available that can help support and maintain an acceptable quality of life for months to years. Your veterinarian may recommend treatment for any other comorbidities such as arthritis that can contribute to pain and mobility issues. There are alternative treatments such as physical therapy and hydro therapy that are aimed at maintaining a healthy body weight, decreasing muscle wasting and slowing down the progression of disease. Lastly, there are a number of tools aimed at supporting the patient's ability to stand and walk such as mobility slings, rugs or carpet over tiled surfaces, pet ramps, and wheelchairs.

## What is the Prognosis and Quality of Life?

The prognosis for dogs affected with degenerative myelopathy is poor. They often become completely non-ambulatory and unable to support their own body weight within a year of their initial signs. It often leads to urinary and fecal incontinence, and around the clock care to ensure access to proper food and water intake, and assistance with urination and defecation. This is especially challenging for owners with larger dogs, thus it is prudent to think about the dogs quality of life and humane euthanasia when they become unable to stand and walk on their own.
