Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

Eagerness for the veterinary profession has been cultivated in me since my teenage years by a deep fascination with animal health. The sheer magnitude of intellect and complexity that goes into being a veterinarian drove me to the profession. During my nights in Emergency Medicine, I discovered the need to offer tender, kind, and serene end-of-life care for my patients and their families. I wanted to provide relief to the pet in the comfort of their home and give their parents the grief time they needed.

## What pet parents are saying

> Dr. Sanchez was friendly, professional, and compassionate. My pet still had some active years left, but was put down due to aggressive behavior mandated by the county. Even still, she interacted with the dog and petted him and made and my last moments with him better with her demeanor. A+ for Dr. Sanchez.

> Dr. Sanchez was warm, empathetic, and professional during our experience. She answered our questions, explained the process thoroughly and was very kind throughout. I would highly recommend her services to anyone considering the very difficult decision of euthanasia that we had to make for our sweet dog, Bacall. Thank you Dr. Sanchez.

> Dr. Evymarie Prado Sanchez was wonderful with our dog, Parker, and with us, his human parents. She 100% understood the emotional and physical situation and had never met any of us before. She explained the procedure clearly and everything happened as she said it would. It takes a special person to do what she does. She followed up after Parker was gone to check on us. I would highly recommend her .
