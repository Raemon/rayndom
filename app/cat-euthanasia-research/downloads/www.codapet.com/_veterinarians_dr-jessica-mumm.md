Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

Our pets are one of the few constants in our life. They play such a grounding role for us, with their unconditional love and support. It is truly the last loving decision we can make as their caretakers to help them pass peacefully, with dignity and respect. As a veterinarian that has helped with end-of-life care both in home and in a clinic, I see the many great benefits for families and their pets with the privacy of in-home services, where both are the most comfortable and relaxed in their own environment.

> This was a beautiful experience. Dr. Mumm was so kind, took the time to get to know our pup but also our other pup, spoke gently and talked through everything in advance. For our senior pup who hated getting in the car, this was a much nicer way to say goodbye to her.

> What a beautiful experience we had with Dr. Mumm and our dear cat. After 17 amazing years her body was telling us it was time to and Dr.Mumm came to our house for this end of life. She was beyond gracious, so warm, and calming in her review of what was to happen. I would recommend her to anyone faced with this difficult decision as she made it as lovely as it could be for us. My heart was broken but also warmed that our cat left us in such a loving way.

> If I could give Dr. Jessica 100 stars, I absolutely would. We recently faced one of the hardest moments of our lives, saying goodbye to our 10.5 year old golden retriever, Seamus (left in photo), just five months after losing his littermate, Logan (right in photo). It was a heart wrenching decision, but Dr. Jessica made an unbearable experience as comforting and compassionate as humanly possible. From the moment she arrived at our home, she felt less like a doctor coming to perform a service and more like a trusted family member walking alongside us. She came out to our back porch where Seamus was resting. Although he was too weak to show his usual smiles, he still greeted her with a wagging tail, a testament to the warmth and gentleness she brought with her. Dr. Jessica took her time to sit with us, pet and love Seamus and explain every step of the process with such patience and care. She emphasized over and over, "Take your time," and "It's okay. When you're ready." There was never a sense of being rushed, only compassion, understanding and genuine love for our boy in his final moments. She even brought extra treats for Seamus, ensuring he was spoiled with love and kindness right to the end. Dr. Jessica also had a couple of thoughtful surprises for us that meant a great deal to our family. Her attention to both the emotional and professional aspects of her visit was extraordinary. If you are reading this and struggling with an impossible decision, I am deeply sorry. I understand the pain you're feeling. But if it offers even a small bit of comfort, I can confidently say Dr. Jessica is the person you want by your side. We will forever be grateful for the care, dignity and compassion she showed us and Seamus during this heartbreaking time. Thank you, Dr. Jessica! You are truly a blessing.

> She loves animals, and showed such care for our Penny dog and us! At home euthanasia was the perfect way to respect our dog and let her pass with dignity. She gives lots of treats and interacts with your pet with you and gives time for happiness!!! Our Penny greated her at the door and was so happy interacting with Dr Jessica Mumm! It's the hardest thing to do for your loved pet, but the most unselfish thing, and Dr Jessica helps you with that. She did a great assessment lettingbus know the time was right.

> I want to give so much thanks to Dr. Jessica. We had to say goodbye to our family cat of 16 years, Gizmo down due to metastatic cancer. He was on hospice already and it was time so he wouldn’t suffer, his pains meds were only managing so much and his status was declining. I honestly have to say this was the hardest decision I have ever had to make and it broke my heart. Dr. Jessica was so kind, patient and supportive to us during the process. My Gizmo who isn’t font of outsiders was even kind to her and let her pet him. If you have to make this hard decision for your loved pet I would definitely recommend Dr.Jessica. Doing this at home made the experience so much easier for myself and family. I was balling but I Gizmo and my family got to be in the comfort our own home and he got to listen to music, and be cuddled by his family as he passed.

> When we made the painful decision that it was time to send our sweet Bella to heaven, we knew her final moments needed to be spent in the comfort of her own home — relaxed, calm, and surrounded by the love she gave us every day of her life. It was the least we could do for her after all the unconditional love she had given us. Dr. Jessica Mumm was an absolute blessing during one of the hardest moments we’ve ever faced. She was incredibly kind, compassionate, and professional from the moment she arrived. She explained everything gently, moved at our pace, and gave us all the time we needed to hold Bella, talk to her, and say our goodbyes without ever feeling rushed. Her presence brought peace into a heartbreaking moment, and she made Bella’s transition as gentle and dignified as possible. We will forever be grateful for the care, respect, and empathy she showed our girl — and us. If you are facing the impossible decision of in-home pet euthanasia, I cannot recommend Dr. Mumm highly enough. She gave our Bella the peaceful passing she deserved, and that is a gift we will always remember.

> Our dear hound Frankie woke up Saturday morning unable to walk due to the pain of his hip dysplasia. We knew our 13 yr old friend suffered from the condition, but it finally crippled him. We spent a sleepless night, watching him agonize over not being able to go outside to do his business. Sunday morning I looked for home services for pet euthanasia and found Dr. Mumm. She replied immediately and put me at ease. Frankie had suffered abuse before we adopted him and had a terrible fear of riding in a vehicle so we needed someone to come to us. She arrived and explained the procedure calmly and sympathetically. Our whole family was able to be there to say goodbye. It is one of the hardest choices a pet lover has to make, but Dr, Mumm did everything right, as far as we are concerned. Have already recommended her to friends and family. Thank you!

> Dr. Mumm was incredible. She called the morning of the appointment and talked about the process. She offered to come earlier than the scheduled appointment time if that would make it easier on us. When she got to our house she took time to get to know our Sunshine a little bit and talk about what was going on with her. She also let me talk about Sunshine, my memories of her and what a wonderful dog she has been for us. She was so kind and reassured us that we were doing the best thing for my little girl. We have lost many pets due to old age, but this was the hardest time ever. Thank you to Dr. Mumm for making it as gentle as possible.

> Dr. Mumm was incredibly compassionate and caring even though we booked a same day appointment and she had not met our family before. Our dog was so clearly in pain that day and we needed help urgently, she was truly incredible. I work in hospice (for humans) and had high expectations, she exceeded all of them. I just can't say enough about how she made a very difficult situation less painful for the whole family.

> Just before New Years, we noticed some changes in our beloved elderly cat, Callie, who unfortunately went downhill quite quickly. We scheduled a vet visit with our local vet clinic for early New Years Eve day suspecting we were nearing the end but hopeful she might pull through. When the time came for the appointment, it became more clear to us Callie was in rough shape and the thought of bringing her to the vet and her last moments alive being of sheer terror didn't feel good for us. We started calling around to several vets who perform home euthanasia, but being New Years Eve and due to our more rural location, we were coming up short. Thankfully one of those companies recommended CodaPet. I was able to make our appointment for that day online and shortly after Dr. Mumm reached out via phone to talk to us about what was going on and what to expect. When Dr. Mumm arrived, she did an exam on our kitty to help us confirm what our gut suspected and helped us to know we were making the right choice for Callie. She was so very kind to us, our kids, and our sweet cat. She was so patient, compassionate, and flexible to our needs in the moment. The whole process was handled just beautifully, in one of the worst moments of our life. We also just received the kindest sympathy card with all the little details, and it meant the world to know she truly listened and cared. We are just so so grateful for CodaPet and Dr. Mumm for being there for us in a time where we really needed it. We will recommend CodaPet to anyone with pets facing a similar choice. Thank you Dr. Mumm and CodaPet!

> We recently had to say goodbye to our beloved dog, Wilson, and chose in-home euthanasia so he could be comfortable in his favorite place. Wilson was quirky, special, and so very loveable. Dr. Jessica Mumm came into our home and showed such kindness, patience, and empathy throughout the entire process. She treated Wilson with the utmost compassion and dignity, and she gave us the space and support we needed during such a difficult moment. Her gentle presence made an incredibly hard day just a little bit easier. We are so grateful for the care she provided to both Wilson and our family.

> Two weeks ago today I needed to euthanize my big, handsome, and sweetest boy ever Archie. He was 14, and his precipitous decline was so sudden. I didn’t even know home pet euthanasia was even an option, until I began looking online that morning. Dr Jessica was such a gift to me and my family members that were able to gather here to love Archie and say goodbye together. The worst possible day happened in the best possible way. And I know he’s very happy now with my mom and dad, and all our family members in heaven. Thank you, Dr Jessica for walking us through that morning of mourning.

> Dr. Jessica Mumm has the most soothing voice and demeanor and quickly put our family at ease. She knew right away that Blanca was suffering and explained the symptoms that she could see. Dr. Jessica told us that we had made the right decision. We knew that Blanca was not the dynamic dog that she used to be, but losing her seemed unimaginable. Dr. Jessica gave us all the time we needed to say goodbye, which we were so grateful for. Blanca passed so peacefully we barely knew that she was gone. I will highly recommend Coda Pets to whoever needs this important service. Thank you from the Trotter family 💝

> This was the best possible choice for saying goodbye to our pet. Jessica is very informative, compassionate, gentle, humane and loving to both the pet and the humans! We needed someone to come out to our house right away. Jessica bent her schedule to fit us in at the last moment. She offered us options for afterwards, including take away of your loved one and help with deciding what to do with their remains. In our case it includes delivery to our vet when our cats ashes are ready to come home. She gave us a paw print of our kitty and a few other things. This was my kids first pet and my first time having to do this, so it was especially hard for us. I was very nervous and scared. This was perfect for our situation and for helping my kids go through it. I have already told a few people about our experience. I hope this place thrives and continues to do the great work they do. It takes a very special person to do this service. Thank you!

We had the time to tell stories and be together in the comfort of our home, so it wasn't scary for Mango. She helped him gently fall asleep and then when we were ready, she helped him peacefully be euthanized. This is never an easy life event to process and accept, but Dr. Mumm and CodaPet made it about Mango and us and we are so thankful we found her!
