## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I understand the heartache of saying goodbye to a beloved pet firsthand. During my rigorous studies at LSU, I navigated the loss of my childhood companion, Creasy. This personal experience fuels my dedication to ensuring a peaceful transition for every furry family member, turning moments of sorrow into moments of comfort and relief.

## What pet parents are saying

> Dr. Alexander was very kind and gentle when helping my Kelsey transition. I really appreciate her explaining what to expect so that my kids would all be prepared for what they might see. She took great care with those last precious moments and while transporting her. Tonight she went out of her way to bring Kelsey’s remains back to us so we could finally be reunited. Thank you Dr. Alexander for your compassion.

> Dr Alexander was wonderful to help us through the emotional and difficult time as we said good bye to our beloved family member, Tucker. She explained every step of Tucker's transition and was so patient and kind. We were given time to grieve and say goodbye. Thank you for helping our family through this difficult time.

> It has been very difficult and sad since my soul dog passed but I have comfort in knowing that with Dr. Alexander’s help my dog transitioned in peace, with dignity, and without fear. Dr. Alexander was compassionate, understanding, and respectful throughout the appointment and created safe space for my beloved dog to pass in comfort. Dr. Alexander treated my dog with gentleness, kindness, and care. The decision with my dog’s passing was difficult to make but I feel that doing it in my home where my dog felt at ease was the best decision for my dog and my family.

> We made the heartbreaking decision that it was time to let our beloved dog of 17years go. We wanted it to be as peaceful as possible for her and for us. We decided on in home pet euthanasia and contacted three options before deciding on CODAPet. Dr Derecka Alexander contacted us to make the arrangements. She was extremely supportive. When we described our dog's decline she made helpful suggestions about how to manage her comfort and medications until we were ready to make the decision. She described the process for us and was extremely gentle with our girl. She was not in a rush and gave us time to grieve privately. We recommend CodaPet highly. Even the operators are extremely empathetic. Dr Alexander helped make an extremely sad day better for us.

> Dr. Alexander was wonderful and I cannot thank her enough for helping me peacefully say goodbye to my very beloved cat and best friend of 16 years in the comfort of our home. I was worried as she was a very shy cat, but Dr. Alexander was patient and understanding and she was able to administer the sedative while my cat was calmly in my lap. Then we had her rest on a blanket once everything took effect for the rest of the procedure. The doctor even sent her sympathies in a handwritten card and hand-delivered the cremains and pawprints to me (I had ordered an extra). I was amazed at the beauty of the mementos. First a cut of her fur was placed in a small jar which she placed near a picture I had laid out. The cylinder urn is beautiful, navy blue with silver pawprints. The pawprint came lovingly displayed in a leather box that doubles as a photo frame when closed. Each came in a velvet bag. Finally, I just wanted to express my appreciation for Dr. Alexander and CodaPet for allowing me to book such an emotional procedure online when it was difficult to speak without crying, and for having late hours available even on a weekday. You came through for us when we needed it the most so my family could all be there together to say goodbye. Thank you.

Everything was seamless and it allowed me to stress less and focus more on grieving the loss of my pet. Can’t recommend Dr. Alexander and CodaPet enough. Thank you!

> We had to say goodbye to our pup Leo, who we had for 16 years, and it was one of the most painful things I ever had to do. Leo had advanced kidney disease and his health quickly deteriorated. We had scheduled a Coda Appointment with Dr. Derecka Alexander for a Tuesday, but Leo’s health took a turn for the worse on a Sunday. I emailed Coda Pet to ask if there was any possibility any Vet could come out sooner. Dr. Alexander immediately contacted me and made herself available in our time of need. We were so appreciative of Dr. Alexander’s compassion and kindness in helping our beloved pup Leo cross over the rainbow bridge, especially after it became urgent. She made a very difficult experience of us having to say goodbye to our pup more manageable. We chose to get a Vet to come to our home for our final goodbye to our Leo because we wanted him to be surrounded by the warmth of our love, the comfort of his family, and the smells and sounds he has always known. I wanted his last memories to be of us — his family — holding him, kissing him, thanking him. Thank you, Dr. Alexander, for allowing us to provide that to our pup Leo.

> We recently had to make the difficult decision to help our elderly, very sick German Shepherd girl across the Rainbow Bridge. Our vet recommended CodaPet in-home pet euthanasia and we are so grateful as our dog really would have been more stressed having to go back to a vet office. Dr Derecka Alexander came to our home and was so comforting, compassionate, professional and gentle with our dog (and us). It's still so hard, but our dear pet went peacefully in her favorite surroundings. Thank you, Dr. Alexander.

She made sure I had the time I needed with my cat as he was dying. Thank you to Dr. Alexander and Coda Pet. I am forever grateful that I could say goodbye to my cat at home.

> Upon arrival Dr. Alexander was quiet and respectful, which immediately showed me that she understood the weight of the day. Through the process there was no attempt at lightening the mood or even small talk. She showed reverence, respect and great empathy when explaining the process. After the procedure she stepped out and gave me the time I needed to say my goodbyes and once I let her in she handled my boy as if he was her own. Overall a very professional experience, incredibly well handled. While I don’t wish to use CodaPet or Dr. Alexander again anytime soon, they will be go-to whenever my next furry family member needs a peaceful passing.

> Dr. Derecka Alexander went “the extra mile” to make the “at home pet euthanasia” of our 14 year old retriever mix Lilly as comforting as possible for our family. She arrived very prepared with all of her equipment and immediately, gracefully and professionally took charge of a very emotional situation. She could see that Lilly was stressed and was able to calm her before she began the procedure. She created a peaceful setting with the soothing music and answered in detail all of our questions. Dr. Alexander made the sad and grief stricken passing of our Lilly a beautiful blessing. Thank you Dr. Alexander, your knowledge, organization, compassion and communication make you an outstanding Veterinarian and fellow human being.

> Our need was dire, it was the week of Christmas and our beloved cat was dying. The vets we spoke to could only fit us in on Christmas Eve and we knew saying goodbye to our boy on Christmas Eve was not ideal. And then we met Dr. Alexander. She went out of her way to ensure we could say goodbye to our beloved cat before the holiday. She was kind, empathetic, and considerate. Her tone was compassionate while remaining precise in preparing us for what to expect. Afterwards, she ensured we had space to say our goodbyes, to grieve. She took our boy and after the holidays returned him to us personally, in beautiful box and kind note. Words cannot express how grateful we are for Dr. Alexander. Her work is hard, but so very important. Thank you, Derecka. We ever grateful to you.

She brought calm the moment she arrived, carefully and gently explaining each step of the process, doing everything with great care to ensure our dog had a peaceful end, and to help us through the process. She was also outstanding with our younger dog, making sure she was calm, and able to watch the process so she would understand what was happening with her pack mate. Dr. Alexander did everything possible to ease our dog, and us, through the process of saying goodbye and giving our beloved dog, the blessed, restful and peaceful end she deserved.
