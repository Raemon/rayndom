> Dr Cory was patient and kind and informed us every step of the way. It was a very difficult time for us, but she reassured us. We were making the right decision to let our Coco pass peacefully at home. We highly recommend Dr Cory she treated Coco with Grace and Love all the way and had a special memorial in her car which just made it even more comforting that she was going to be transported with Love.

> Making this decision is one of the hardest decisions, for me, to make - but having the ability to have my Jasper pass at home, in my arms, while in no way easy, but so much more comforting for me and I believe Jasper - there was no stress of going to the vet, waiting in the waiting room, waiting for the doctor. Dr Cory was wonderful, listened to my concerns and extremely compassionate - thank you very much for being there for me and Jasper.

> Dr Cory Korsgen, introduced herself as Cory. She did not rush. She was thorough in evaluating that the euthanasia was timed right and that it was the best thing for our pet. She was accommodating to our needs and gave so much of herself in our time of grief. She treated the whole process with so much respect and care. Even the transport of our pet after he passed was done so with care, he was carried out in comfort and the back of the vehicle was specially prepared to receive him. She made herself available for last minute requests. I will always recommend this for those that want their beloved fur babies not to suffer. Cory is a caring and beautiful person and she gives a part of that beauty to a very sad event helping to make the loss a little less painful. I am Forever grateful for you Cory.

> In-home euthanasia with Dr. Korsgen is truly the best option. Dr. Korsgen put me at ease and walked me through the entire process from start to finish. She was very knowledgeable, gentle, and my dogs loved her. While it was unbelievably hard to say goodbye it was really nice to be able to do so at home. It was also very helpful to have my other dog present during the process so that he could have some closure. Thank you so much Dr. Korsgen!

> Dr Korsgen was wonderful. She is a good communicator, explained everything she was doing, and was gentle and compassionate toward our beloved kitty. And very kind to us. It was worth every penny to say goodbye to our kitty in our own home and with such a skillful and caring practitioner guiding us all through it. 💔 Thank you Dr Korsgen

> Dr. Korsgen was the most empathetic and kind professional during the euthanasia of my canine friend. She even went the extra mile to rearrange her schedule to arrive at my home a few hours earlier than originally planned, because my dog's decline and suffering were escalating. I'm not a religious person, but Dr. Korsgen was an angelic presence. She was so sweet and gentle with my dog, and so very patient and understanding with me. I will always be thankful to Dr. Cory Korsgen for her special touch.

> Deciding to put a pet down is one of the hardest decisions a pet owner can make. My friends suggested booking an appointment with Dr. Korsgen to do in home pet euthanasia. I cannot speak highly enough about the entire experience. Although my heart was shattering during it, Dr. Korsgen provided the most respectful and beautiful experience I could have asked for. I'm eternally grateful that I got to say goodbye to my best friend in the most loving, compassionate way possible.

> I highly recommend Dr. Korsgen for in-home euthanasia. She is gentle, compassionate, and a terrific vet! I have had my dogs put down at the animal hospital in the past, and seeing them so anxious in their last hour is heartbreaking. Every pet deserves to be in the safety of their own home, next to the people they love, and in the care of a phenomenal veterinarian. Dr. Korsgen, I sincerely hope I will not need you anytime soon, but when the time comes I will 100% be calling you again.

> We recently had to make the incredibly difficult decision to say goodbye to our beloved boxer, Rocco. After a lifetime of love, loyalty, and joy it was important to us that his final moments be peaceful and in the comfort of his own home. We were fortunate to have found Dr. Cory, who came to our home and helped guide us through this emotional process with the utmost compassion and professionalism. From the moment she arrived, Dr. Cory was gentle, kind, and incredibly respectful not only to us, but most importantly, to Rocco. She took the time to explain each step of the process, allowing us to move at our own pace and ask questions as needed. Her calm and compassionate demeanor helped bring a sense of peace to an otherwise heartbreaking moment. What stood out the most was the care she showed for Rocco. She ensured he was comfortable, pain-free, and relaxed, treating him with the dignity and tenderness he deserved. Her presence helped us feel less alone in our grief and more at peace with our decision. We are so grateful for Dr. Cory and the service she provided. While nothing can take away the sadness of losing our sweet Rocco, having him at home, surrounded by love, with someone so compassionate guiding us, made all the difference. Thank you, Dr. Cory for helping us give Rocco the goodbye he deserved.

> During one of the saddest moments of my life, I was lucky enough to find Dr. Cory Korsgen to help us say goodbye to Misfit, my faithful companion of 14 years, my amazing cat. Misfit gave me so much more than just companionship, she gave me love and kept me centered in life here and now and notso much in the past. With Dr. Korsgen careful and caring direction, my sweet cat died in my arms after peacefully falling to sleep. Everyone is different, but for me this was the right decision for so many reasons. I am forever grateful to CodaPet and Dr. Korsgen; they were caring, supportive, and treated our grief with respect and understanding.

> On February 25th, I had to make the most heartbreaking decision—to say goodbye to my sweet girl, Bella, after her battle with cancer. As painful as it was, the thought of doing it in a cold veterinary office and walking away with only her collar made it even harder. I couldn’t comprehend how I was supposed to walk in with her and leave without her. In the midst of my distress, a friend told me about in-home pet euthanasia—something I hadn’t even known was an option. I immediately began researching and found CodaPet - At Home Pet Euthanasia. I am beyond grateful for this recommendation, as it allowed Bella to spend her final moments at home, surrounded by family, her favorite toys, and the warmth of the sunset from her favorite window spot. Dr. Cory Korsgen was an absolute blessing. She was incredibly compassionate and understanding, not only toward Bella but also to me and my mom. She provided us with comfort and support, walking me through every step of the process with care and patience. She was gentle with Bella, ensuring she felt no pain, and allowed me to hold her paw and stroke her head as she peacefully passed. While nothing can take away the pain of losing Bella, knowing she was in her own home, in peace and comfort, rather than on a cold metal table, brought me immense solace. To anyone facing this incredibly difficult decision, my heart is with you. If you are able, I strongly encourage considering an in-home service—it makes an unimaginable moment just a little more bearable, both for you and your beloved pet. Days later, as I was slowly beginning to pull myself together, I found a beautifully handwritten letter from Dr. Cory Korsgen in my mailbox. The moment I opened it, tears filled my eyes. It was so personal, so thoughtful, and an unexpected kindness that meant the world to me. That letter now sits beside Bella on the mantle, a testament to the love she gave and received. I hope Bella knows how deeply she was loved and how she left a pawprint on every heart she ever met. 🐾💕🙏🏻🐶

> Dr. Cory made what was a heartbreaking decision and day so much easier for us to get through. We had our doubts about if it was “the right time” or if we were doing “the right thing”. Dr. Cory took the time to help us become comfortable with the decision we made (over the phone prior and at our home the day of). We were blown away by the compassion and sincere empathy she showed us. She is a genuine, kind, respectful person who goes above and beyond to be a source of strength for those who are experiencing the loss of a loved companion. Being able to be share our Boxer Dog Sammi’s last moments with her in the privacy and comfort of our home allowed us to grieve and also celebrate Sammi’s amazing life without distractions or the discomfort of being in the presence of strangers at a veterinary office. Although we never met Dr Cory prior, it felt as if she was also part of our “pack” and was celebrating Sammi’s life and greiving along with us. Thank you for everything, Dr. Cory.

> Dr. Cory was so genuinely compassionate at a time when our hearts were absolutely broken. We could not have imagined a more caring person coming into our home and helping us survive the trauma of sending our 16 and 14 year old pugs to the rainbow bridge together. She truly was the best Dr. we could have asked for to be with us during the saddest time of our lives.

> I am so grateful for the in home euthanasia experience I had with Dr. Korsgen. Dr. Korsgen was sympathetic, knowledgeable and knew just what to say to make a really difficult time a little easier. I’m glad I didn’t have to put Marley through the stress of bringing her to the vet. I was so thankful that the last moments for Marley were spent in her home. I would recommend Dr. Korsgen. I am so thankful that in home euthanasia is now an option. Thank you.

> Dr. Cory Korsgen has been incredible with both of my dogs. Her genuine passion for animals really shines through in the way she interacts with them, and it’s one of the main reasons I keep coming back. She’s amazing at reading their body language and understands their individual personalities, which allows her to tailor each visit to their unique needs. I have a cocker spaniel who is anxious and a german shepherd that's more rambunctious, and she handles both of them with patience and care. Thanks to her calm demeanor and ability to build trust, my dogs feel comfortable with her, even in stressful situations. I highly recommend her to anyone looking for a vet who truly understands and loves animals!
