# Can I Let My Dog Die Naturally?

[Dr. Bethany Hsia](/experts/dr-bethany-hsia)

March 31, 2024

A natural death is one that occurs as a result of the disease process or failure of one or more major body systems. It is important to note that a natural death can be assisted or unassisted. Join us as we explore both, discuss the stages of natural death, and an alternative way to say 'goodbye' to your dog.

## **What You Need To Know**

  1. There is no set amount of time it takes for a dog to die naturally.
  2. The time it takes for a dog to die depends on factors such as age, underlying illness, and access to medical services.
  3. The most common signs your dog is dying are loss of appetite, extreme fatigue, labored breathing, incontinence, disinterest in surroundings, cooler body temperature, and unresponsiveness or confusion.



The time it takes for a dog to die naturally depends on various factors, including age, underlying health conditions, and overall care. Some of those factors include:

  * **Old Age** : A senior dog experiencing organ failure may decline over days or weeks.
  * **Terminal Illness** : Diseases like cancer or kidney failure can lead to a gradual decline over weeks or months, but the final stages may last a few days.
  * **Lack of Food/Water** : If a dog stops eating or drinking, death can occur within a few days to a couple of weeks.
  * **Comfort & Palliative Care**: With proper hospice care, a dog may pass peacefully at home over an extended period.



As unpleasant as it can be to think about the end of a beloved companion’s life, understanding the stages and potential timeline of the natural dying process can help families know what to expect should they choose to allow a natural death for their dog.

If you're dealing with this situation, make sure to speak with a vet. Read on to learn more about natural death in dogs and when euthanasia may be right for you.

## **How To Know If Your Dog Is Dying**

Recognizing when your dog is nearing the end of life can be difficult, but several signs indicate their health is declining. While every dog’s experience will be different, some common signs of a dying dog include:

  * **Loss of Appetite and Thirst:** Your dog may refuse food and water, showing little to no interest in eating or drinking.
  * **Extreme Fatigue and Weakness** : They may sleep more than usual, struggle to stand, or show little interest in activities they once enjoyed.
  * **Labored Breathing** : Irregular or strained breathing patterns, excessive panting, or long pauses between breaths can indicate the body is shutting down.
  * **Loss of Bladder or Bowel Control** : Incontinence or difficulty going to the bathroom is common as the body weakens.
  * **Disinterest in Surroundings** : Your dog may withdraw from family, show less interest in affection, or prefer to be alone.
  * **Cooler Body Temperature** : As circulation slows, your dog’s body temperature may drop, and their paws or ears may feel cold.
  * **Unresponsiveness or Confusion** : They may seem disoriented, have trouble recognizing familiar people, or stare blankly into space.



## **Defining Natural and Assisted Death in Dogs**

As with people, end-of-life pet deaths either occur without medical intervention (natural) or with medical intervention (assisted.) While similar, there are some key differences.

### **What Is Natural Death In a Dog?**

A natural death occurs as a result of disease or failure of one or more major body systems. It is important to note that a natural death can be assisted or unassisted.

An unassisted death will vary widely depending on the disease process at play but will likely involve great suffering. In the wild, animals who are reaching the end of their life won’t usually have the opportunity to die from their body failing. More often, they succumb to dehydration or exposure, if not predation. For a pet that is sheltered from such agents of Mother Nature, death can occur more slowly but also with prolonged suffering. This is not a humane option.

An assisted natural death is one where a patient can be kept reasonably comfortable, and their symptoms can be managed while they move through the dying process. Such care is usually referred to as hospice or palliative care, where the goal of treatment is comfort rather than cure. It is important to note that not all diseases allow for this type of palliative death. For example, if the pet is suffering from a disease that affects the respiratory system, such as Congestive Heart Failure, or one that bears a risk of bleeding out, such as a ruptured Hemangiosarcoma, a palliated natural dying process is not a humane option.

### **What Is Assisted Death in a Dog?**

Assisted death, commonly known as euthanasia, is a medically facilitated process to end a dog’s life in a humane and painless manner. This decision is typically made when a dog is suffering from a terminal illness, severe injury, or a significant decline in quality of life with no hope of recovery. Veterinarians use medications to ensure the process is peaceful and free from distress.

Euthanasia is often chosen to prevent prolonged suffering. Unlike natural death, which can be unpredictable and painful, assisted death allows pet owners to provide a controlled and compassionate end for their beloved companion. The procedure typically involves administering a sedative to relax the dog, followed by an injection that peacefully stops the heart.

Choosing euthanasia is never easy, but it is often considered the most humane option when a pet’s pain and discomfort outweigh their ability to enjoy life. It allows owners to say goodbye in a calm, loving environment, ensuring their dog does not suffer unnecessarily.

## **What are the Stages of A Natural Death In a Dog?**

There are three general stages of natural death that a dog will experience. However, they are not always distinct. Stages may overlap and progress at different rates depending on the individual dog’s circumstances.

### **Pre-Active Phase**

The pre-active phase refers to the period leading to the active dying process. During this stage, dogs may exhibit subtle changes in behavior and physical condition. They may become more withdrawn, lose interest in activities they once enjoyed, experience changes in appetite, show signs of fatigue, weakness, or restlessness, and have difficulty maintaining normal bodily functions. The duration of this phase can vary from a few days to several weeks.

### **Active Dying Phase**

The active dying phase is characterized by more pronounced changes in a dog’s physical and mental state as organ functions fail and toxins build up in the blood. Dogs receiving palliative care may not display pronounced signs of this stage, but the unassisted death of a beloved dog can be very difficult to witness. Dogs in this phase may exhibit extreme weakness, difficulty breathing, decreased responsiveness, disorientation, loss of bladder and bowel control, nausea, vomiting, and unregulated body temperature. Dogs in the active dying phase may also experience seizures or uncontrolled muscular activity. This phase may also include barking or vocalizing without an obvious cause or intent to communicate. The active dying phase typically lasts a few hours to a few days.

### **Terminal Breath Phase**

The terminal breath phase is the final stage of the dying process in dogs. During this phase, breathing patterns may become irregular, shallow, or labored. The dog may take long pauses between breaths or experience periods of rapid breathing. This phase can last anywhere from a few minutes to several hours.

## **Pros and Cons of Natural Death**

Natural death comes with a variety of pluses and minuses. Here are a few examples.

### **Pros of Natural Death in Dogs**

  * **Avoids Medical Intervention** : Some owners prefer to let their dogs pass peacefully at home without medical procedures.
  * **No Stress From Vet Visits** : Euthanasia requires a trip to the vet, which can be stressful for some dogs.
  * **Allows for a More Natural Process** : In nature, the body shuts down on its own time without external interference.
  * **Can Provide Closure for Owners** : Witnessing a natural passing can offer emotional closure and a sense of completeness.
  * **May Be More Comfortable in Familiar Surroundings** : The dog can remain in their home, surrounded by loved ones.
  * **Avoids the Ethical Dilemma of Euthanasia** : Some owners struggle with the decision to intervene and prefer to let nature take its course.



### **Cons of Natural Death in Dogs**

Potential for Prolonged Suffering: A natural death can be slow and painful, especially for dogs with terminal illnesses.

  * **Difficulty Managing Pain and Discomfort** : Owners may struggle to provide adequate pain relief without medical intervention.
  * **Unpredictability of Timing** : Natural death can take days or even weeks, making it hard to plan for the dog’s comfort and care.
  * **Emotional Toll on Owners** : Watching a beloved pet decline naturally can be emotionally distressing and traumatic.
  * **Possible Loss of Dignity** : Incontinence, labored breathing, and loss of mobility can lead to a decline in the dog's quality of life.
  * **Can Be Harder on Other Pets** : Other animals in the household may become anxious or stressed during the process.
  * **May Lead to Regret** : If the dog suffers, some owners may later feel guilty for not choosing euthanasia to prevent prolonged distress.



## **Pros and Cons of Pet Euthanasia**

Assisted death comes with a variety of pluses and minuses. Here are a few examples.

### **Pros of Euthanasia Death in Dogs**

  * **Prevents Suffering:** Euthanasia ensures a peaceful and painless passing, sparing the dog from prolonged discomfort.
  * **Quick and Humane:** The procedure is swift and minimizes distress for both the dog and the owner.
  * **Provides Control Over Timing:** Owners can choose the right moment, ensuring their dog passes with dignity.
  * Can Be Done in a Familiar Environment: Many vets offer at-home euthanasia, allowing the dog to stay comfortable.
  * **Reduces Anxiety:** Professionals manage the process, ensuring minimal fear or confusion for the dog.
  * **Eases Emotional Burden for Owners:** Knowing their pet is not suffering can bring comfort and closure.
  * **Prevents Unexpected Complications:** Avoids the potential for a distressing or drawn-out natural death.



### **Cons of Euthanasia Death in Dogs**

  * **Emotional Difficulty:** Making the decision to euthanize can be painful and guilt-inducing for owners.
  * **Timing Uncertainty:** Some owners struggle with deciding the right moment, fearing they may act too soon or too late.
  * **Cost Factor:** Euthanasia, especially at-home services, can be expensive.
  * **Regret or Doubt:** Owners may question whether they made the right choice, particularly if their pet had a few good days before passing.
  * **Clinical Setting May Cause Stress:** If done at a vet’s office, the unfamiliar environment could make the dog anxious.
  * **Cultural or Religious Concerns:** Some beliefs may discourage or prohibit euthanasia.
  * **Final Goodbye Can Feel Rushed:** The process happens quickly, leaving some owners unprepared.



## **Assessing Your Dog’s Quality of Life**

When considering euthanasia for your dog, it is helpful to take stock of their quality of life in an objective manner. This may be easier said than done. Begin by honestly asking yourself:

  1. Is my dog still eating and drinking? If they can’t eat or drink independently, can I provide a way for them to eat or drink comfortably?
  2. Can they still enjoy the same activities and social interactions with me and other pets in our household?
  3. Is my dog comfortable? Is it able to move about to urinate or defecate in appropriate places, and is it able to rest without experiencing pain?
  4. What is the quantity of their good days; are they having more good days than bad?



However, if your answers to the above questions are “no,” then it’s probably time to consider what is most important to you regarding end-of-life care for your dog. Will you provide palliative or hospice care to support your pet as they move through the dying process? Will you arrange for euthanasia, and if so, what type of goodbye will best suit your family? How will you memorialize your pet and honor their memory? There aren’t right and wrong answers here; the important thing is to discuss your options with your veterinarian and formulate a plan that you are comfortable with.

If you’re still unsure, using tools to assess your dog’s overall physical and mental well-being will generate a numerical value you can track over a period of time. Keep in mind that the decision to pursue at-home euthanasia for your dying dog is a deeply personal and challenging one. By considering factors such as your dog’s quality of life, emotional well-being, and the support available to you, you can make an informed decision that is most appropriate for both yourself and your pet.
