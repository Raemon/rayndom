Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

My life growing up was on a diverse IN farm with pets and livestock. Some of these mostly four-legged family members we raised from birth, while others were adopted. I’ve nurtured and loved many pets. My childhood led to being a veterinarian. Our pet’s lifespan may be short, their unconditional love and companionship make them just as much a part of our family as the rest of the household. This bond overwhelms our hearts with joy, while also creating one of the toughest challenges when it comes time to say ‘good-bye,’ emphasizing why the end-stage of life deserves special attention and care. I recognize an expanded need for affordable top-notch end-of-life pet care in the Columbia, SC area. My goal is to assist families and their beloved pets through this difficult and emotional experience with peace and dignity.
