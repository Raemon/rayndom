Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

My love for animals combined with a deep understanding of science and a fascination for medicine guided my path to becoming a veterinarian! A graduate of Tuskegee University College of Veterinary Medicine. I find all aspects of Veterinary medicine fascinating but if I had to pick one field, it would be internal medicine!

## What pet parents are saying

> Dr. Canty has been providing excellent care for our senior Standard Poodle for approximately 4-5 years. Her compassion is second to none! On 12/07/2024 her & her assistant came to our home to euthanize our beloved Mia. It was a calm, lovely experience. Dr. Canty & Alex were patient & most caring. She also took care of having Mia’s remains removed right then & set up for cremation & an urn in advance.…we didn’t have to do anything during this heartbreaking experience. I highly recommend & am so grateful for her loving manner. She will be our veterinarian for the next dog we get. ❤️🐩❤️
