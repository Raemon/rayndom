# Pet Aftercare & Cremation Near You

We understand that choosing what to do with your pet’s remains is an extremely personal decision, and we want to completely honor your wishes. As with every other aspect of your pet’s transition between life and death, your personal preferences and beliefs, as well as cost and local regulations can all affect your decision. Here are several options.

## Cremation

Cremation is the option most often chosen by our pet parents, in part because our CodaPet vets can handle all the cremation details for you, whether you decide on private or communal.

### Private Cremation

This makes it possible for us to return the remains of your pet in an urn of your choice. You can then choose to bury the ashes, scatter them, or even transfer them to a decorative urn or other keepsake. If you would prefer water-based cremation (Aquamation) rather than traditional flame based, please ask your CodaPet vet if this is available in your area. If you'd like to consider the different options of urns we offer, please consult with your CodaPet vet before or at the appointment.*Aquamation places your pet’s body in a bath consisting of water and salts that together, hasten the process that would normally occur if your pet had been buried. It takes longer than traditional cremation (up to 24 hours) and has less impact on the environment.

### Communal Cremation

We also offer communal cremation options for a lower price. This option ensures your pet is cremated with others and the ashes are ceremoniously spread on the crematorium grounds or another location.

## Burial

### Private Burial

If your city/county regulations allow, you can choose to bury your pet on your personal property. Please check local regulations to see if this is legal in your area.

### Cemetery Burial

Many areas have pet cemeteries where you can bury your pet and mark the grave, making it possible for you to visit as you might with any other family member who has passed. If you want to bury your pet in a cemetery, you will need to choose and make arrangements with a local pet cemetery [before the euthanasia appointment](/schedule-appointment). Please be sure to let your CodaPet vet know if you have planned for such a burial.

## Other Options

### Taxidermy

Some people choose to preserve a lifelike replica of their pet. If you are interested in this option, we recommend that you ask the taxidermist you plan to use to determine the most ideal method of storing your pet’s remains after passing. Please share this information with your CodaPet veterinarian as soon as possible so they are aware of your wishes.

### Charitable Donation

Some people find comfort in knowing that as painful as it is to say goodbye to their pet, his or her remains can provide invaluable learning opportunities for future veterinarians and pet nurses. If that resonates with you, contact a veterinary teaching hospital or university prior to [euthanasia](/pet-euthanasia-near-me) to determine their current need. Please be sure to ask them if there is a particular drug that your CodaPet Vet should either use or avoid so that your pet’s condition at the time of passing will remain clear for the students to study. They might also have questions for your regular veterinarian about your pet’s general health and diagnosis.As difficult as it is to think about any of these options, deciding what you want ahead of time will help all concerned to honor your wishes.

“We can't say enough kind words about Dr. April. She is extremely kind and has a very calming presence. She really understands the grieving process and did everything possible to make for the most comfortable and nurturing goodbye possible. We really appreciate her great attention to detail every step along the way. She clearly has put in a lot of thought into making for a peaceful goodbye and taking all the best steps possible to help with the grieving process. Thank you so so much, Dr. April, for everything you do.”

“Dr Mary was truly kind and compassionate during our appointment. We ended up having to schedule the visit sooner than we initially expected as our senior kitty got rapidly worse. Nothing about that day was easy, but everything was taken care of for us so we just got to be there for our companion. Dr Mary walked us through every step of the process, making sure we and our senior kitty were comfortable the whole time. I am so grateful we were able to say goodbye at home, where our kitty felt safe, and get those precious extra minutes with him. ”

“Dr. Schmalz is calm and patient in all that she does. She's gentle and helps answer any questions every step of the way. My dog greeted her with curiosity and Dr. Schmalz just let Bella sniff and explore until she was comfortable. My dog selected her special place for her last moments, and Dr. Schmalz accommodated that without question. It was important to me that my other dog be present and that worked out well. We never felt rushed in any way.”

“I can’t say enough good things about Dr Kristi Thompson’s kindness and compassion both before, during, and after this process. 10/10 would recommend. She thoroughly and professionally explained the process. She listened carefully to the long list of ailments our senior dog was experiencing. She then examined our dog and explained what was potentially treatable, and what the prognosis was. This allowed us the chance to make a fully informed decision before proceeding. I appreciated that, especially since it was a lethal one for a very loved family member. We never felt rushed or pressured one way or the other. I just wish there were people doctors who were as attentive, kind, compassionate, and laid out the various options to their patients. ”

“We are extremely glad we choose to have April help us with this very sad moment for our family. She was able to provide the understanding, professionalism, and emotional support that we needed, helping us and our 10-year-old daughter to say goodbye to our elderly dog. In the time she was with us, April was present and open. She didn't treat us as clients; she treated us as new friends and that made all the difference. We recommend her without any hesitation. ”
