> We had to make a very tough decision to send our beloved 15 year old Natty to dog heaven. Michelle made this a peaceful process. Because of Michelle we know Natty is in a peaceful place. She was very polite and understood our pain. I would recommend Michelle to anyone that has to go through this.

> We were so emotional about the whole thing but knew we did not want to take him to the vet to let him go. She was so patient and compassionate, she made it as easy as it could possibly be. She personally returned his ashes to us and again made it so easy to let our beloved pet go. It was a blessing to find her.

> Dr. Michelle Vosburg was amazing through this difficult time for my family. She was professional, yet genuinely empathetic and caring, helping us through everything. I've met funeral directors that do not have the bedside manner and comforting aura that she does. I hope you never need her services, but if you do, this is definitely the way to go.

> Dr. Michelle Vosburg is an Earth Angel, and I do not say that lightly. From the moment she walked through my door, I knew she was more than "just a vet". As soon as she looked at me, she began to weep. She is a true Empath and felt my breaking heart. She sat on the floor with me, holding my hand and Maggy's paw as she listened to how I had rescued Maggy and how Maggy had rescued me. We both cried and she loved on us both. Dr. Vosburg helped me give Maggy a beautiful walk to the Rainbow Bridge. Being able to help Maggy cross here at home helped more than words could ever describe. I truly love Dr. Vosburg, and again, she's an Earth Angel; I highly recommend her to help other humans assist their pets in crossing over.

> Dr. Michelle Vosburg was accommodating and supportive in humanely euthanizing our 17 year old cat. We originally had a 9 AM appointment; however, the morning of our appointment it became clear that our cat was quickly declining. When I reached out at 7 AM that day to see if she could come as soon as possible, she came over right away. It gave us great comfort to ease our cat’s suffering. I recommend Dr. Vosburg if you find yourself in the unfortunate position of needing this service.

> When I had to make the difficult decision to say goodbye to my sweet baby Rivers, I elected for in-home euthanasia. I wanted Rivers to be as comfortable as possible during his journey. Dr. Vosburg was a God-send. She was so gentle, caring, and compassionate with us and Rivers. She explained every step and what to expect. There was no hurrying or rushing, allowing us the time to say goodbye and love on Rivers one last time. I'm so grateful for Dr. Vosburg and CodaPet in helping Rivers on his restful journey. Rest well, my sweet boy! I love and miss you so much. ❤️

> We recently had to put down our 14-year-old dog, and Michelle helped us through the process. She was kind, and compassionate. She explained each step so we knew what to expect, and she made sure our dog was as comfortable as possible. Michelle made it as peaceful and respectful as it could be. We really appreciated her support.

> This was a heartbreaking time for us. Rebel doesn't get along well with strangers. Much less a traumatic trip to the vets office. Dr. Vosburg was so patient and showed so much love and compassion for him (and my husband and me). To have Rebels' last minutes on earth in our laps where we could comfort him meant so much. Thank you so much Dr. Vosburg for helping us through this sad time. Would rate 100 stars if we could! Ann Rawls

> They are amazing! My baby was only 6 years old. And he was poisoned only the poison didn’t take him right away it was slow and we didn’t know what was happening to him . He just lost himself he was no longer the dog we knew he became almost like mentally challenged and senile at the same time . I brought him to the vet and the blood work came back clear. So for a couple months he went from just acting mentally challenged but still eating drinking and walking on his Owen still trying to play but being kind of aggressive to not walking or eating on his Owen to potting in the kennel and the house vertigo really bad and I had had enough I couldn’t get him in the car he started having seizures and I didn’t want him to be scared but it was time. I wanted him free of whatever this was that took my baby. Dr. Vosburg was so patient and gentle and she came to the house no judgment at all just kind and compassionate she went slow and at his side she gave him the sleep meds let us love on him and then sent him on his way to freedom . My heart is never gonna be the same after having that bundle of energy that loving adorable baby in my life , and even though I wasn’t supposed to be sending him off yet , as sudden as it was , having him sent off that way was perfect and I felt ok sending him with her. They are just amazing people and I’ll forever call on them when I need to. Thank y’all so much.

> It's so tough to say goodbye to loved pet, but when the signs all say life isn't fun anymore, you know - and it's a true gift to let them go in the most peaceful and caring environment you can. I hurt so much more than I thought I would letting go of my dear Sasha, faithful and loving companion for well over 14 years. Dr. Vosburg was gentle, slow, and considerate of the heartache she knew was coming. She coaxed my baby girl and gave us a moment to share each others space before letting her go. It was hard, but I wouldn't have given her up in any other way than in the comfort of a familiar place. All my appreciation to you Dr. Vosburg - for the kindness and the heartfelt note days later

> Dr Vosburg is amazing. She is so caring. She made me and my sweet Ella so calm and comfortable in the worst situation… I lost my 7 yo Great Dane to seizures just days before having to put Ella down. Thank you, Dr Vosburg for helping Ella in the transition to go be with her sister

> Dr Michelle was so very kind and empathetic. She gave us all the time we needed, to cuddle our boy and let him feel safe in my arms, as he quietly passed. She was also very respectful when taking him from our home that day and returning his ashes and memory items in 7 days, as promised. I can't say enough how comforted I felt, spending those last few moments with my precious little MeatPie.

> Dr. Michelle Vosburg made such a hard time meaningful and peaceful. Our very good boy Gibson was relaxed and peacefully slipped away while we talked to him and loved him. I held his face in my hands and he gazed at me with love. I am so thankful for such a calm and loving ending to our good boys time on earth. He brought such joy to our lives, I am forever grateful we could help to give him a loving and dignified transition.

> Dr Vosburg is a kind and caring professional. She talked us through the process and was very respectful of our feelings. She handled our pup with great skill and gave us time to grieve. This was the final gift that we could give our family dog. It was a fitting end for Lily who gave us much love and laughter. I highly recommend Dr Vosburg to anyone considering at home pet euthanasia.

> Dr. Vosburg was so empathetic during this whole process. She was there with us to talk us through the entire process, what to expect, and to simply hold our hands and cry with us. I’ve lost a few fur babies and this was by far the gentlest way of saying goodbye for now to my sweet girl.
