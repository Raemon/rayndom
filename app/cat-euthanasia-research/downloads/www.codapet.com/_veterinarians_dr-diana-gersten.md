> We had no idea that at home euthanasia was an option until hearing from a friend that they did an at home passing for their dog. Once we knew it was time, we searched online and found Codepet and Dr. Diana Gersten, and she was beyond amazing. It is such a better experience to have your little loved one pass at home in their own bed and Dr. Diana was great with us. She gave us so much time to get Holly comfortable and give her some snacks and she was genuinely caring and interested in hearing stories about Holly and what made her so special. She allowed us to take our time and give Holly so much love as we said goodbye and she drifted off to sleep. Dr. Diana also gave us plenty of time to grieve as well. This was absolutely the best choice we could have made to say goodbye to our little girl Holly. Thank you Codapet and Dr. Diana Gersten for being there and making such an awful situation the best it could be.

Our family can not thank her enough for helping guide us through the step by step end of life process for both of our 18 & 19 year old fur babies. It is never easy to make an end of life decision for your pet, but Dr. Gersten provides a thorough exam of your pet as soon as she arrives to your home and explains everything to you so that you know you are making a well informed decision for your pet. Dr. Gersten and Codapet provide the most compassionate and private end of life services for your pet family members. Thanks Dr. Gersten & Codapet.

> I want to thank CodaPet - At Home Pet Euthanasia in Fort Lauderdale for their service. As one can imagine, this is not the easiest decision to make. I did not feel pressured not compelled to make this choice other than it was the right thing to do for Buddha. He was a wonderful dog and I believe he was given a proper, professional, and warming send off. I personally want to extend a thank you to Dr. Diana Gersten. The whole process was difficult for myself on an emotional and spiritual level; however, with Dr. Gersten's caring and gentle approach, i felt as ease. She was great with communication, confirmation in Buddha's condition and walked me through the steps accordingly. With Buddha having issues walking, having an organization willing to come to the house on 24 hours notice was a huge help and sigh of relief. I can not speak for other organizations, but if one needs an in home treatment, I would highly recommend CodaPet - At Home Pet Euthanasia in Fort Lauderdale.

> Pet euthanasia done the right way, we didn’t want to make the difficult decision that it was time to let go of our elderly dog but Dr Diana Gersten at CodaPet made the process as stress free as possible for us & our dog. From the ease of booking the service on line that gave us time to make the last few days as memorable as possible, to the communication before the appointment was gentle & supportive. When meeting Dr Diana Gersten in person she was very kind & compassionate walking us through the process, there was no pressure to rush & she sensed when to step back & give us time & space in our own home, our dog was calm & comfortable in his bed when she arrived & remained so throughout & that was perfect. Even though it’s one of the hardest things we have had to do I wouldn’t change a thing & would highly recommend the service without hesitation.

> I truly appreciate having an in-home euthanasia option when faced with a suffering pet. I liked the CodaPet electronic intake form because I didn’t have to struggle through that process telephonically, struggling through my tears and sobbing. I was offered an opportunity to discuss directly with Dr Gersten the day I booked the appointment and appreciated that so much. We connected the morning of my appointment again at my request and she was great and communicative. I’ve sadly been through this before but when she arrived she made sure she let us know what to expect and was very skilled with my pup, Roxie and informed and supported us as we comforted Roxie throughout. I had selected private cremation during the intake process and she confirmed my selections, even crediting a duplicate selection I had made and paid for. It made this heart wrenching need easier and let my Roxie breathe her last breath, and her heart to beat its last beat in the peace of our home while we held and comforted her for the last time. Thank you. We’re very appreciative of everything.

> In the past two years we have lost both of our dearly loved pet cats to chronic Kidney disease. One was 16 years old, her brother, the second and more recent loss was 18 years. the euthanasia necessary to relieve suffering in their final days was an unwelcome but expected additional personal trauma. Their usual veterinarian's office was very familiar with the sister and brother cats and with our personal emotions, and suggested CodaPet, in the home euthanasia, as an option for Zorro. That is how we met Dr. Gersten. We made a home appointment so that the surroundings, the home, and our being able to hold and comfort Zorro would be possible. It is never easy to say goodbye no matter how necessary. Dr. Gersten was the very best , arriving at our home at the planned time, tending to our very ill cat, and for supporting my wife and I during that difficult time. Much better than a dash to a vets office amidst rush and confusion . She was also able to provide services for a cremation which was an added and ultimately highly appreciated service. My wife and I are very pleased with our experience and highly recommend Doctor Diana.

Our beloved dog was able to remain in the comfort of her own home without stress and anxiety. It was a peaceful process for her and the care and consideration the vet had for my feelings and time were greatly appreciated. I received her ashes back much quicker than expected and the package was just what I hope for. Thank you for everything.

> She was the absolute best. The whole process we were kept informed, she gave myself and my family plenty of time to say goodbye, and treated my Mya with such care afterwards. At first I felt such guilt over putting my dog to sleep, but with Dr. Gersten it was a feeling of immense relief and gratitude when it was all done, because I know she was happy at home and felt no pain through the whole procedure. Thank you again.

> Dr. Gersten is a very kind, soft spoken, compassionate person. She made a difficult situation a beautiful one. I was able to hold my baby as he went “Somewhere over the Rainbow “🌈 . She made me feel very comfortable as she did with Pacino. She let me spend as much time before and after the procedure with him. I would highly recommend her. She is a beautiful person. Thank you Dr. Gersten for everything.
