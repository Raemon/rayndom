Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

One of my earliest memories is of saying goodbye to my mom’s dog, Amy, when I was 4 years old. The veterinarian who helped us through that experience was so kind, compassionate, and methodical—I never forgot it. That moment inspired me to become a vet, and it continues to shape my passion for supporting pets and their families during end-of-life care. Before starting this work, I spent years in emergency veterinary care, helping families through some of their hardest moments. This experience helps me bring both clinical expertise and heartfelt understanding to families facing the most difficult goodbye. After recently saying goodbye to my own beloved dog, Jackie, I truly came to understand how important it is to be able to say goodbye at home—in a space filled with comfort, love, and familiarity. That experience shaped my approach and deepened my commitment to helping others navigate this difficult time with compassion, respect, and peace.

> I was really struggling with the decision to put my kitty to sleep. I knew it was eminent because her health was declining, but the thought of someone taking my sweet girl away was agonizing. When the time came, Dr. Thomason put my mind at ease immediately. Her kindness was apparent right away and I completely trusted her to take good care of my sweet girl. She took great care of both of us. Thank you so much, Dr. Thomason!

> Dr. Thomason was incredibly kind and gentle with us in the process of helping our girl, Sheila, go. She took the time to sit with us and explain the process, got to know both Sheila and our other dog, Tillie, and handled what was a very emotional event for us with kindness and professionalism. We especially appreciated how Dr. Thomason followed up with us afterwards sending us a lovely handwritten / handmade card. For something as difficult as making the decision to help a pet pass on, I would highly recommend Dr. Thomason.

> Dr. Jill was absolutely everything we could’ve needed or wanted in this time of grief. She came in our home with grace, kindness, sympathy and explained everything along the way perfectly concisely and clearly. She treated our sweet Lily with the utmost care and love as we would have. I truly don’t think there was any other way we could’ve said our goodbyes to our fur baby without the help and care from Dr. Jill! I would absolutely recommend Dr. Jill Thomason as even though this is an incredibly difficult thing to do, she truly helped provide the care and closure we needed at the end of our kitty’s life!

> We are very fortunate to have found Dr. Jill to help our beloved cat Joan depart this earthly plane :) Immediately after booking she reached out and offered to meet with us to talk through the decision, which we had been equivocating over for days. When it came time for the event itself, Dr. Jill was very organized and compassionate and enabled us to have a deeply meaningful experience during Joan's passing. Looking back we can't imagine having to do this in a vet's office and are so grateful we could do it at home. We'd highly recommend Dr. Jill!

> This is one of the hardest experiences for those of us who adore our pets. For animals who are traumatized by car rides and vet visits it makes it all the harder to know their final moments are stressful. I was given Dr Thomason's name by our vet and opted for the in-home procedure. It was still a heart-breaking moment, but having Jojo in her usual place, on my lap, unafraid was a much more peaceful end to her life. Dr Thomason is empathic and caring. She didn't rush anything and took the entire process at my pace. I am so grateful for her calm demeanor. She made one of the worst moments in my life easier, knowing Jojo was not stressed in the least and her final moments were with her family in her familiar home. The paw-print card that arrived in the mail was so appreciated. I very highly recommend Dr Thomason for anyone who opts for an in-home euthanasia.

> Jill was amazing- she was very communicative and accommodating when we requested an earlier time for our home euthanasia for our pup. I let her know my 4 year old would be there and she was careful and gentle in how she spoke to him. She made an awful process so much more comfortable; I will recommend her again and again!

> Putting a beloved pet to rest comes with such complex and heavy emotions. Dr. Jill made the entire process stress-free, approaching every interaction with deep compassion, patience and helpfulness. From initial scheduling to final arrangements, Dr. Jill has been communicative and very responsive over text and email. We are so grateful to her for ensuring that our sweet boy was able to transition peacefully at home, as well as ensure that we have all of the information and arrangements we need for the care of his remains. We would highly recommend Coda Pet, and especially Dr. Jill.
