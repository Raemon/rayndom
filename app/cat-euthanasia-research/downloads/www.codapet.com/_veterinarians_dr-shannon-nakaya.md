About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

It was never my mission to be a euthanasia "specialist", but I understand why clients appreciate the option of in-home euthanasia when the goal is a peaceful passing. As a veterinarian for Codapet, my objective is to facilitate smooth transitions and graceful exits.

> It was with a very heavy heart I had to say goodbye to my sweet Bella! My heart was breaking. Dr. Shannon made the transition for Bella go very smoothly. Finally Bella was at peace and out of pain. I highly recommend an at home euthanasia and I highly recommend Dr. Shannon. She is kind, courteous and if it in anyway could be easier on me she made it so. Thank you Dr. Shannon. 🙏🏻

If you’re in need of at home care for your furry family member, she’s the best! Mahalo nui loa for all you do, Dr. Shannon!
