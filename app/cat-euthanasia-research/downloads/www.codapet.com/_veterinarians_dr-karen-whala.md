Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

There is truly no better way to honor our beloved pets last wishes than to help them pass, when its time, peacefully and painlessly in their sleep, at home, surrounded by family. I firmly believe it, because it is a desire we all would want when that time comes.

## What pet parents are saying

> Dr. Whala was a sweet soul to work with. She was very compassionate and we could tell her voice and demeanor put our Charlie boy at ease. She made a very difficult situation as bearable as possible. I wouldn’t have had it any other way than having Charlie at home surrounded by family, to cross the rainbow bridge.

> This was the hardest thing me and my wife had to do .. we had our dog 15 years she was our baby we loved her and spoiled her and try to take the very best care of her.. she walked every day till her last 5 days she showed signs of pain and discomfort and eventually couldn’t get up and was crying a lot .. we wanted to keep her comfortable and let her go on her own but she was such a fighter and we couldn’t have her be in pain .. we found dr. Karen and she we like an angel sent from heaven she was so kind and gentle and explain everything got my dog very comfortable in her bed in her home and around all her family .. its very hard to lose something so close to you.. but this service made it so much easier for our dog and family to be there.. it was sad but yet very beautiful to see how much everyone loved my dog .. would recommend this to every pet owner!

> I am sure all the vets are great, but I can only speak about Dr. Karen. Dr. Karen was fantastic; we appreciated her listening and compassionately answering all our questions. She explained the process and took her time. We were all able to love on Lucky and say goodbye. She gave him some prosciutto with a relaxant, and from the time he walked back to his spot, he started falling asleep. Lucky was ready :( It happened very quickly, and then she gave him a shot, and within a few minutes, he was gone. She didn't rush; she waited until we were ready. I am so relieved that we could say goodbye to Lucky at home, surrounded by those who loved him.

> Karen was the kindest and thoughtful person. She dealt with us so patiently and understood our pain. We are so happy that we found this option for our Allie. I couldn’t bear the thought of it being done in a facility that would have caused her stress. She took to Karen and was very calm. Our girl was able to leave all her pain and struggles behind in the comfort and warmth of her own home and with those who loved her by her side. One of the saddest days of our lives was made a little easier knowing we did this for her and in the best way possible. They handled everything. Thank you so much! Our highest recommendations!

> Dr. Whala is one of the most incredible, caring, intelligent person I have ever met. She turned the worst day of my life (so far) into a loving, meaningful experience. Words simply cannot describe the care that Dr. Whala took with my beloved dog. My dog passed in peaceful comfort thanks to Dr. Whala. Dr. Whala also provided us with peace with the decision that the timing was right. Working with Dr. Whala was one of the best decisions that i have ever made. I am truly grateful to Dr. Whala and will remember her for the rest of my life. The Fresno community is beyond lucky to have Dr. Whala working in it.

> Dr. Karen Whala made my first experience with in-home pet euthanasia a very positive one. I will definitely use her service again when the time comes. She is kind and compassionate and was very gentle with my dog Sadie. Dr Whala never rushed the process and made sure Sadie stayed comfortable during the whole procedure. Choosing in-home pet euthanasia gave me an extra day to love and spoil Sadie while accepting that we were not going to have her anymore. It also gave Sadie comfort in her last hours to be free from severe anxiety that going to the vet brought her.

> Our experience with Dr. Whala was an incredible one. Our 17 year old cat had been living with kidney disease for several years, but it progressed rapidly the last two months. Within a few days he greatly declined and we were faced with the unthinkable choice of putting him to sleep or continuing to care for him while he suffered unnecessarily. When we finally decided to have him humanely euthanized, our regular vet's office recommended CodaPet. We had to make a very fast decision, and were able to book an appointment with Dr. Whala the very next morning. From the moment we booked to the appointment, everything went professionally and with the utmost compassion. Dr. Whala texted the next morning to confirm everything and explain the process. When she arrived, she was extremely kind and caring, and allowed our entire family the time and respect to spend as much time as we needed with our beloved cat. She explained the entire process and was just lovely in her demeanor. It was obviously an emotional time, and she knew exactly how to proceed without overwhelming us. As the visit continued, she explained everything she was doing and made sure to ask us if we had any questions or concerns. She provided compassionate care and went above and beyond to respect this difficult time. For anyone wondering if this is the route for them to take, I highly recommend at-home euthanasia with Dr. Whala. Yes, it was difficult and not an enjoyable time, but I can't thank her enough for the care she took to help our beloved Indy cross the rainbow bridge. If you are in a similar situation, or questioning whether this is the right decision for you, I absolutely recommend using Dr. Whala and allowing her to help your loved one pass on with dignity. Thank you Dr. Whala for honoring our cherished pet.

> Losing our beloved Bully was one of the hardest moments for our family, but Dr. Karen Whala helped us through it with compassion, grace, and genuine care. From the moment she arrived, she created a peaceful and comforting environment that honored Bully’s life and eased his passing. Dr. Whala was incredibly supportive—not just to Bully, but to every member of our family. Her presence brought comfort during a heartbreaking time, and we are so grateful for her gentleness and professionalism. The resources shared by the CodaPet team were thoughtful and meaningful, especially the grief support and memorial ideas. It truly felt like we weren’t alone. Thank you, Dr. Whala and the entire CodaPet Care Team, for helping us say goodbye with dignity and love. We will never forget it. — Villarreal Family

I can’t begin to put into words how grateful I am that my Stoney was able to be home in his last chapter surrounded with love and his favorite human by his side!

Thank you for making the experience as peaceful and painless as possible.

Literally prepped in the flower bed and went to where our doggy was hiding. Her words were comforting and encouraging throughout the time she was there. So thankful for her home service. After this, no one should be driving a vehicle anywhere! Thank you Karen for your kind hear for our girl who is not in any pain now. 🐾🐾❤️

> I only hesitated to give a 5 star rating because Dr. Whala did not call me sooner about our date with Endora's passing. She called that morning to ask if I was having second thoughts which I was. I had another boxer put down in 2022 and I sensed Dr. Whala was hesitant to put her down because she was worried I would feel "incredible guilt" because Violet seemed to be doing a little better. I went ahead with the euthanasia after talking to my vet again and I did feel horrible as Dr. Whala feared but I am now okay with the decision. Violet's heart was bad and Endora had metastatic cancer. My point is that I had Dr. Whala's imput for a day or so and then again on the day of the euthanasia. I love Dr. Whala and just wanted a phone call the night before. I wanted my hand held I guess.

> This was, unfortunately, our second time using this service. But I will never go through this any other way. The vet who came the first time many years ago had moved away so I chose Dr. Karen this time because I was present when she helped my sister say goodbye to her dog a few years ago. Her beside manner is absolutely beautiful. She's so calm, patient, caring, and soft spoken. As soon as she walked in the door, it was as if she's a regular guest in our home. She sat down on the floor and immediately made friends with our Herman. He felt safe and comfortable with her right away. She explained every step of the process thoroughly and told us what to expect. More importantly, she explained it in a way our children could understand. It had been ten years since our last goodbye, and I hope it'll be that or more until our next. But I also hope Dr. Karen will still be available when that time comes. I recommend her 100%. Thank you, Dr. Karen 🤍

Chloe was relaxed and laying in our arms when she passed and crossed over. There was no anxiety, or stress for her. Just soft hands and words. We are never ready to make the difficult decision, but knowing Chloe was ready and it was so peaceful for her, made our grieving a little more bearable. Our hearts are broke but will forever be grateful for Dr. Whala’s support and guidance during such a difficult time. Really there are no words for what she does but so grateful.

> My girl Molli was 16 this past June and when she took a turn for the worse I reached out to Peaceful Passing/Coda Pet for help. While her appointment was scheduled for a few days later, Dr. Whala was able to come sooner - this allowed Molli not to be in pain or any discomfort for any longer than needed. The whole process was amazing and left me knowing that it was the best outcome for Molli. There was no rush, no judgement, no criticizing - just compassion and understanding. We were given time to be with Molli through the entire process. We also chose to have Molli cremated and wanted her ashes back. I was expecting to get a call to go pick up those ashes but instead I was greeted by an individual at my house that hand delivered Molli back to me. Unbelievable service from beginning to start - I would not do it any different.

She was very informational and told you everything she was doing before she did it. Dr. Karen Whala Truly made an INCREDIBLY difficult situation go smoothly and with her support.

She is so kind gentle and loving to both your pet and your family at such a difficult time. It was a very peaceful and beautiful moment because we all got to be there with him and say goodbye. When she went out to get the stretcher she even suggested we bring our other dogs in to sniff him so they would understand. I can’t recommend her in this service enough. Whatever extra it costs for having her come out is 100% worth it. You won’t regret it

The good doctor was so gentle and compassionate towards my boy and to me in such an hour of distress. She truly has a vacation for God's creatures and a spirit of loving respect us humans too. Thanks ever so much Dr Whala and for the recorces for grief. My heart continues to be heavy not having him around. I do have great satisfaction that his passing was of great dignity and peace in his own home. He deserved all the love and care as he gave me so much in return

> We actually have a unique story. When Dr. Karen arrived and assessed our Bandit, she said, “I don’t think he’s ready to go.” Without going in to every detail, she spent an hour with us as we observed Bandit, and discussed all that was going on with him. We determined that a medicine we were giving him was overprescribed and that was likely what caused his symptoms. Anyway, as I said, there’s much more to the story, but the end result is that Bandit is still with us! Dr. Karen was extremely compassionate, calm, comforting, not in a rush, and knowledgeable. We wholeheartedly appreciated her calm and discerning manner and the way in which she explained her thoughts and feelings to us. It is a comfort to know we now have a Dr./company we can turn to if we need to put a pet down. We live in the foothills/mountains and it is so nice to know we have Dr. Karen who would come to us in our time of need. Our gratitude is immense. Thank you, Dr. Karen. ♥️

The vet who came the first time many years ago had moved away so I chose Dr. Karen this time because I was present when she helped my sister say goodbye to her dog a few years ago. Her beside manner is absolutely beautiful. She's so calm, patient, caring, and soft spoken. As soon as she walked in the door, it was as if she's a regular guest in our home. She sat down on the floor and immediately made friends with our Herman. He felt safe and comfortable with her right away. She explained every step of the process thoroughly and told us what to expect. More importantly, she explained it in a way our children could understand. It had been ten years since our last goodbye, and I hope it'll be that or more until our next. But I also hope Dr. Karen will still be available when that time comes. I recommend her 100%.

Dr Whala has a true understanding of what we as dog owners feel about our furry friends, she knows they are our family and we love them with all our hearts. There is never any rush when Karen visits your home for the final goodbye, the last moments of our babies is so difficult and Karen understands the pain we are going through.

> Where do I start? My dog, Einstein, was diagnosed with lymphoma three weeks prior. It exploded throughout his body faster than the doctors expected and while he and I were on a road trip. Einstein woke one day, in obvious pain. I got lucky and found Dr. Whala through CodaPet. She was able to come see me that afternoon. It was either that or wait 4 days for the next availability (it was Thanksgiving). When she came to our house, she took the time to say hello and let Einstein and me get to know her. After she observed him and I explained his situation, she helped him pass in the most peaceful way I've witnessed. It's difficult for me to express exactly how peaceful it was, except to say, I couldn't have wished for someone to treat my buddy better. There was no pain and he felt loved. There was no sudden change but rather, a gentle transition. It's never easy making this choice but I feel Dr. Whala was the right choice for Einstein.

> "I am sure all the vets are great, but I can only speak about Dr. Karen. Dr. Karen was fantastic; we appreciated her listening and compassionately answering all our questions. She explained the process and took her time. We were all able to love on Lucky and say goodbye. She gave him some prosciutto with a relaxant, and from the time he walked back to his spot, he started falling asleep. Lucky was ready :( It happened very quickly, and then she gave him a shot, and within a few minutes, he was gone. She didn't rush; she waited until we were ready. I am so relieved that we could say goodbye to Lucky at home, surrounded by those who loved him.".

> Dr. Whala was amazing. My boy was suffering, but she made sure he didn't feel a thing. For something so difficult to go through, Dr. Wahla made it just a little bit easier.

> Losing a beloved pet is never easy, but Dr Karen made this difficult situation a peaceful experience. Our sweet Roxy got to pass in the comfort of our home surrounded by her favorite human & furry family members. Dr Karen was very kind and compassionate throughout the appointment. She truly has a gift for what she does and how she does it. We can’t thank her enough. While we hope we don’t need to use this service anytime soon, we will definitely seek Dr Karen’s help the next time it is needed.

> I have had to use Dr Whala twice in 5 months and she makes a sad and difficult time less difficult. She was wonderful with both my dogs. She takes time to explain what she is doing, makes sure the pet is comfortable at each stage of the process, and wraps it up very nicely.

> We were recently faced with making the decision to say goodbye to our Rottweiler, Cookie. This is the second time that Dr Whala has assisted us and each time she has shown kindness and compassion as well as loving care to our beloved pets. We can't thank her enough for her sympathetic care and professionalism.
