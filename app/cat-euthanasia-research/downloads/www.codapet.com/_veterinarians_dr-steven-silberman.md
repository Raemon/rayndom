Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

My next door neighbor growing up in Alabama was a large animal veterinarian and as tough as they come. My good fortune was that he had 5 daughters and no sons. This gave me the unique opportunity to ride with Dr. Buck as his gate opener on farm calls and challenged me to try to become an animal doctor. That was 1981 and I've lived a life in service to animals ever since, mostly by trying to provide lower cost veterinary care, especially in the operating room. Medical standards and treatment options for the animal patient now rival human medicine. Lives can be extended or made better in ways that did not exist when I started. Additional quality time can be provided, but it has limits and the inevitable always arrives. This will never change. After treating many thousands of medical and surgical cases, I have learned that no service that I could every offer was as significant or kind as humane euthanasia performed for the right reasons, at the right time and especially, the right way. The right way, and usually the best way, is in the home (if medically possible). The reasons are many and the experience is almost always so much better for the patient - and everyone involved. Although the medications will make euthanasia painless regardless of location, there is always stress (or distress) for a loved pet when compelled to visit a vet clinic, especially when unwell. In home euthanasia is perhaps the most loving act that we can provide for our cherished family member when the time to say goodbye has arrived. My experience has validated my belief in this service and I hope to finish my career helping in this way. For me, this is a significant opportunity to continue to fulfil my veterinary oath for as long as I can. A hospital seems a terrible place to leave this earth if it can be avoided. Calling CodaPet can help make a sad day much easier.

## What pet parents are saying

> It started off with bad communication. He called, I returned his calls, no answer. After many attempts and two hours later, we finally communicated. When he showed up, he was asking about my dogs history; then stated he would need to do a blood test to see what was going on. My dog was literally on her deathbed; which was more than evident. My dog had been sick for 4 years and on many medications. When he finally opened his bag, he stated he forgot the second medication that would euthanize her. He left and returned an hour later. Though he did euthanize her; his bedside manner and judgmental attitude was not good.
