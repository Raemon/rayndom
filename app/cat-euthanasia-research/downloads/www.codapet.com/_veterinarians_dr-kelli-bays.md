> Dr. Bays was an excellent choice for us. She is professional, kind and sympathetic. She listened to my family talk about our dear cat, and didn't rush us but allowed us to share. The process was thoroughly explained to us, and she did her job with gentleness and compassion. This was a really hard decision for us to make, but we as family, felt so much better after her reassurances. She clearly truly loves animals and was the perfect doctor for us.

> Dr Kelly is an amazing Vet helping those of us who are in distress about the decline of our beautiful animals. The website is very easy, Dr Kelly connects on a personal level after your decision is made and continues to give you options at this difficult time. Dr Kelly is kind and comforting and treats all with respect. A heart felt condolence card was in the mail. Dr Kelly returned our ashes in a beautiful box that was wrapped with love and care. She was still asking and concerned about the ones who are grieving the loss of their best friend. I highly recommend Dr Kelly’s services.

> Why is it that the kindest thing you can do for your pet is probably the hardest decision you will have to make? I have had to go down this road too many times and on October 21st I had to do this again for my 14 year old Maltese mix. I knew we would make the transition happen at home and I was so fortunate to find Dr. Kelli Bales, DVM. Her gentleness and compassion and kindness were exactly what I needed to make this peaceful for my best buddy. She even brought a special treat for him to enjoy as a final desert. I am forever grateful for Dr. Bays.

> Dr Kelli Bays was the exact doctor we needed for Gracie. She was perfect! Her gentle and calm demeanor, her ability to understand what Gracie and we needed at this difficult time, were priceless. She explained every step without making us feel that she is hurrying through a process . She took her time and she gave Gracie a peaceful goodbye. We are ever grateful for her service and codapet. Saying goodbye to a beloved animal, family member is never easy , but with Dr Kelli we felt that our Gracie was in the best hands possible.

> CodaPet was a great choice for our 14-year old cat's end-of-life needs. We were able to book a same-day, Saturday appointment, which was great since our old cat was starting to deteriorate quickly and we wanted euthanasia BEFORE he was experiencing pain and suffering (he'd already lost a good bit of weight). The veterinarian, Dr. Kelli Bays, was punctual, thorough in describing the steps of the procedure, professional, compassionate, and efficient. She was gentle and kind with our old cat, and allowed us to either hold him or put him in his favorite spot for his procedure. We ultimately chose their communal cremation option, and Dr. Bays took care of the delivery to the crematorium. It was such a relief NOT to make our sweet, old, dying cat ride in a car across town to a vet clinic, stressed out on his last day of life. Thank you CodaPet and Dr. Bays for the convenience and ease of home euthanasia. It's a great service and you made the experience stress free. If you are someone considering this service, CodaPet will not be a disappointing choice, but it is a business, so make sure you read the Q&A section of their website for cancelation and appointment change policies, while you are looking over their care options and memorial products.
