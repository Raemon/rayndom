Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

I always wanted to help the voiceless (animals) for as long as I can remembered. After working years in emergency medicine, I want to ensure pet owner's final moments with their precious pets. I see many patients coming to the ER just for euthanasia. We truly try to make the euthanasia experience at the hospital as peaceful as possible. But performing a euthanasia at the pet's home would ensure the best possible experience for them.

> I cannot recommend Dr. Treece enough, she was so kind and had a calming presence. Every step was explained thoroughly and taken at our own pace. It is an extremely difficult decision to put your dog to sleep, but Dr. Treece and her assistant made the hard time much easier and were very respectful of my pup all the way to the end.

> Dr. Treece was professional, courteous and, most importantly, empathetic. She listened to us talk about our dog and gave us plenty of time with her during the procedure. She laughed at her funny stories and agreed when we said LuLu was the best dog ever. This service was well worth the price and Dr. Treece was exactly the right person to perform it.

> Dr Treece quickly reached out to expedite my apt as our beloved baby was rapidly deteriorating. She was very kind to our family, she explained the process and made a very difficult evening as smooth as it could've been. We highly recommend Dr Treece and appreciate having the ability of keeping our fur baby home he crossed the Rainbow Bridge.

> Dr. Treece came to my home to help my bull mastiff Angus cross the bridge. I can not express enough how thankful for her we are. We were told exactly what they would do and what to expect. Treated our pet and ourselves with dignity and respect. No rushing, gave us all the time we needed for our goodbyes. Would definitely recommend her and this service. Thank you Dr. Treece.
