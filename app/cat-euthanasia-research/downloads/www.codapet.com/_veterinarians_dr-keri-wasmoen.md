Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

At a previous practice, Dr. Wasmoen was able to provide in-home euthanasia services to a limited degree. It didn’t take long to realize that while these services are of vital importance, they were in short supply. Dr. Wasmoen was drawn to provide this type of care to allow families to say goodbye to their beloved companions in a familiar, loving, and private environment which can make a world of difference in these difficult situations. CodaPet in particular allows veterinarians to tailor patient care to individual pets and provides the ability to service many communities, extending the option for a peaceful in-home goodbye sometimes outside the range of other veterinary providers.

## What pet parents are saying

> Dr. Keri made what could have been a very stressful and traumatic experience (for us and for our pet) a peaceful and beautiful one. Our pet’s comfort was her top priority. She explained each step of the way professionally and compassionately. I highly recommend her services. I imagine that providing this service takes a special person with a passion for the dignity and care of our 4-legged friends..and Dr. Keri is such a person.

> I always thought when it was time I had to bring my dog to a vet. I was told you can do it at home and I said yes immediately. In home euthanasia was amazing. My dog was comfortable and at home where I wanted him to be when it was his time. Dr. Keri was amazing. She made sure I knew I was making the right decision for my dog. She made him comfortable x2 before starting the euthanasia medicine. She let me have all the time I needed after he had passed to say goodbye. I recommend in-home euthanasia to anyone making that decision for their family member. Picture of my baby of 14 years eating his last meal.

> The whole process, while extremely difficult for us emotionally, was handled in a thoughtful, professional, caring way that really helped us work through a sad and difficult decision. Dr. Keri explained things thoroughly and never rushed us in any way, gave us time to handle our grief, and was genuinely empathetic. She was gentle and kind to our sweet kitten. This was obviously an incredibly hard thing to go through, but we were very glad for the support that Dr. Wasmoen gave us.

> In home pet euthanasia with Dr. Keri - Dr. Keri was extremely kind and understanding throughout the entire process as we were all grieving, as a family, losing our very beloved cat, Smokey. Dr. Keri explained the procedure step by step and also explained again as she administered each medication, and reassured us that Smokey would not be in any pain. If you're looking for a personal experience without the stress of the vet's office, I absolutely recommend Dr. Keri with CodaPet.

> We recently made the incredibly difficult decision to say goodbye to our beloved kitty, Mapache, who was 18 years old. After reviewing his rapidly declining health with our veterinarian—he had not eaten in a week, was losing weight and strength, and was becoming increasingly distant and confused—it was clear his condition was not going to improve. We wanted to spare him further suffering or a traumatic passing, and above all, ensure his final moments were peaceful and dignified. Dr. Keri Wasmoen was recommended to us, and after reading about her experience and her reasons for specializing in in-home euthanasia, we knew she was the right person to help us through this. Choosing to have Mapache remain at home—rather than endure a frightening car ride and an unfamiliar clinical setting—was one of the best decisions we made. Dr. Keri was exceptional from the moment she arrived. She was professional, empathetic, calm, and deeply caring. She took time to explain every step of the process so we knew exactly what to expect, never rushed us, and always centered Mapache’s comfort and dignity. Her presence was genuine and reassuring during an incredibly emotional and sensitive experience. She thoughtfully outlined our options, allowed us to make decisions at our own pace, and ensured Mapache was as comfortable as possible throughout each step. Afterward, with our permission, she provided a beautifully prepared paw print kit with his name stenciled on it and space for a photo, along with a small bottle containing a lock of his fur—gestures that meant more to us than we can express. At one point, I told her that she must have such a hard job. She gently replied that we, as responsible pet owners, had the hardest job of all—and that we were doing the right thing. That reassurance was incredibly meaningful and comforting in the moment. We recommend Dr Keri without reservation.

> Difficult as it was, we made the right decision to euthanize our dear friend Harper after learning of her serious medical condition. We heard of Dr. Wasmoen through our veterinary clinic. She was outstanding in helping us get through the process. Dr. Wasmoen made herself available when we finally made the decision to euthanize Harper at our home. Her communication skills were excellent. Dr. Wasmoen clearly explained what she was doing, how our dog could respond & allowed us the time we needed to get through it. We were both very emotional & Dr. Wasmoen was gentle, comforting & supportive. Our dear Harper left our home peacefully in her care in a comfortable basket. We are grateful for her outstanding care and highly recommend Dr. Wasmoen. Arlene & Rob

> Hi Dr. Keri, It is with heartfelt gratitude I write this message to you. Your compassion and warmth, in addition to the time you dedicated to assisting us with Augie's passing was such a positive experience -- both for Augie and our family. You provided us with guidance on how to allow Augie to feel calm leading up to the morning of your arrival at our home with your suggestion of CBD treats and that feeling continued throughout the experience. With your guidance, Augie was able to pass peacefully in the comfort of his home. This enabled our family the space and time necessary to begin the grieving process together and was a humane, respectful and gentle experience, one that we will cherish. Thank you, Andy Miller

Dr. Keri was incredibly compassionate and supportive throughout the entire process. She gently explained each step of the procedure, helping me understand what was happening and what to expect. What meant the most, though, was that it didn’t feel like just a service or a job to her. She took the time to ask about Mia, to learn what made her special, and to truly honor her memory. Thank you for being there for me—and for so many others—during such a difficult time. Your care and empathy mean more than words can express.

We can't express how thankful we were to have had Dr Keri help us cross Sunny over the rainbow bridge. Dr Keri was amazing the minute she walked into our house asking about Sunny, how we were doing, explaining the process and telling us to take our time. The hardest decision to make was eased with compassion, tenderness and grace thanks to Dr Keri. She is sincerely appreciated in our household.

> Like all pet owners making the decision to end your pet’s life is one of the hardest decisions you will make in your life. So, when our little dog's medical condition began to worsen, and it became apparent that her getting better was not an option we prayed on the decision to euthanize our beloved dog. We had heard of "in home pet euthanasia" from friends and decided to explore that option. We were glad we did and found a wonderful, compassionate and professional Vet that specialized in home euthanasia. Dr. Keri Wasmoen with Codapet was recommended by a friend and we could not have been more pleased with how she handled the last moments of our precious dog's life. From the moment she arrived we were set at ease and given comfort during the process. Dr. Wasmoen took care of everything with unbelievable patience and professionalism. She has a three-step process that gradually leads to the end with a calm and clear explanation of each step and what your pet is experiencing. Dr. Wasmoen made the experience comforting and much easier than we had expected. We feel that our dogs last moments were peaceful and loving and as hard as it was Dr. Wasmoen consoled us and took care of all the details which made the process easier to deal with. We highly recommend Dr. Keri Wasmoen for any pets Euthanasia.

From the moment Dr. Keri arrived, she brought an incredible sense of calm, compassion, and professionalism that helped ease our pain during such a heartbreaking time.

> Dr. Kari Wasmoen came to our home last week to help my 21-year-old kitty complete her journey in peace and relative comfort. While it was a heartbreaking event, Dr. Kari did everything in her power to make it peaceful and comfortable for my kitty and my family. She was a kind, calming presence. She explained everything clearly and calmly and treated my cat and our family with the utmost respect. It was my first time using an in-home pet euthanasia service, and the experience was so much more pleasant and meaningful than I think it would have been in vet's office. I hope it is a long, long, time before I need these services again, but I would absolutely use CodaPet and Dr. Kari Wasmoen again.

I don't think I could have said goodbye in a more kinder, gentler or respectful way. Dr. Keri was so incredibly caring, knowledgeable and patient on which was probably the most difficult day of my tired old life.

> My dog Maggie would have been 14 years on September 10th. She fought so hard to make it till her birthday, but at the end she was struggling. I know we all wish that our pets (ourselves as well) would just fall asleep and pass peacefully, but that didn't happen. The Dr had told me she had congestive heart failure two weeks before, and she declined rapidly. I could not stand to see her struggling. My family decided to help her on her journey. That was the hardest decision I have ever made. Maggie was my companion, my best friend, my baby, my confidant, my snuggle buddy, my walking partner, my travel partner, my everything. I rescued her when she was about 10 months old. I wanted her to be at peace, not in any pain, able to let go and rest. Dr. Keri Wasmoen from CodaPet came to my house and was so kind, so compassionate, so patient, so wonderful. I appreciated very much how when she arrived, she didn't automatically go into the "clinical" aspects of what was happening/going to happen. She sat down on the floor and took some time to let Maggie feel comfortable with her. There was no fear, no anxiety on Maggie's part, and that is because Dr. Keri took that time to ease into everything. She explained step by step what was happening and when, and what to expect and when. She went at our pace. She did not rush anything. She gave my family time to have private, alone time with Maggie after she passed. She wrapped Maggie up in a snuggly blanket. She gave me a lovely box with one of Maggie's paw prints in it, Maggie's name engraved in it, and a space for Maggie's picture. The whole thing was calm, peaceful, loving, compassionate, and I so appreciated everything Dr. Keri did to make Maggie's transition easy for all of us. I would never want to go through that process again, it was so painful on my heart, but I know it was the right decision and I am so grateful that it was Dr. Keri that came and was with us during the process. I would definitely recommend CodaPet and Dr. Keri Wasmoen to anyone that may need to make a decision like I did. I will miss my Maggie every day and will cherish the memories I have of her until I see her again. Maggie Moon 9/10/11 - 8/30/24

> Dr. Kari was so understanding to the pain Miss Holly and we were going thru. She discussed with us about what our Miss Holly was going thru and what she would be going thru during the euthanasia. She said that this would relive her suffering. She also acknowledged our grief associated with saying goodbye to Miss Holly. Dr Kari was very sympathetic and compassionate; she listened and understood our sorrow. We really like to thank her again for helping Miss Holly and us.

> Dr. Keri arranged to assist us with Fawns Soul Return Home and her gentle approach throughout the experience provided us the quietest heartbreak we've ever had to walk through. Our decision was a release from terrible pain our Sweet fur Babygirl was in. We're both very grateful 🙏

> Dr. Wasmoen is so calm and caring during a very difficult time. Our beloved 14 yr old dog had been recently diagnosed with diabetes and we made the decision not to treat. So, when the time came to have him put to sleep, I came in contact with Dr. Wasmoen through Coda-pet. She came to our home and was so kind and considerate of our feelings and even reassured me that it was the right thing to do. She explained everything that would happen very clearly before and while she was doing the procedure. We had as much time as we wanted to spend with him afterwards and she took him out in a basket wrapped in a blanket. Every step of the process was so well done. We received his paw print, some of his hair and later, his ashes. It was such a difficult time but she made it a peaceful ending to his wonderful life.

> Dr. Wasmoen was very comforting for us during this difficult time. We had to make the decision to put down 2 of our senior dogs, so it was extremely difficult and a very sensitive time. She was calm and collected, she explained everything wonderfully. She gave us time alone with them both after they passed. The in-home pet euthanasia was the right choice for our family. With a 6 month old at home also, it was much more comfortable for us to all be together in our home. I couldn't imagine taking my babies to a scary vets office to send them over the rainbow bridge. I'm so glad I found this option for us, and I have already been telling many friends and family about the option. It's definitely worth every penny. We got to keep some of their fur, and we also got paw print keepsakes as well. Dr. Wasmoen bundled them up in soft blankets when she took them, and handled all of the cremation process afterwards. 100% recommend. Sad situation, but a comfortable experience.

> Dr. Keri was a consummate professional with just the right balance of kindness, patience and compassion. The entire process was easy to navigate, timely and so very dignified for our precious dog. We debated initially about the cost benefit of doing this at home vs at the vet. Hands down it was the right decision. Dr Keri carefully explained every step along the way and made sure we understood. Our dog was comfortable, surrounded by her favorite people and took her last breath gently and painlessly. We are grateful.

> Dr.Keri Wasmoen was our Soul Returning angel of mercy. The deep gentle sincere compassion was evident with everything she said and did. I am raw brokenhearted to my core but strangely at peace because of her and the availability of home departure. Fawn my sweet Sweet girl I know you know how precious you 💕 have been in my life...We will be together again...Sweetie Kitty misses you toooooo

> I was lucky to find a spot and book online for the next day after deciding to put our dog, Daisy, out of her misery. We didn't know who the vet would be, but were very lucky to have such a calm, knowledgeable, and thoughtful person in Dr.Keri. Everything went smoothly, they sent text reminders and notices that she was on her way. She gave us whatever time we need with Daisy afterward. She had a nice stretcher to take Daisy away in a respectful way. Dr. Keri had a peaceful and respectful presence during the process that was very helpful for such a sad experience. I highly recommend.
