I am so grateful we had Dr. Lara Allison to help us through this process. I was having a really difficult time making the decision about what was best for Guinness. Dr. Allison came to our home for a consultation. Her medical knowledge of Guinness's needs was important, but her intuitive insights into what he was experiencing and why I was struggling so much with the decision was invaluable. Just talking through all of it with her helped me tremendously. When she came to our home for our final moments with Guinness, Dr. Allison was so compassionate. Her presence allowed Guinness, and our family, to make room for healing in his transition to the other side. I would highly recommend Dr. Allison for anyone who is going through the difficulty of saying good-bye to their fur baby.

Dr Briell is a wonderful vet who was kind, considerate and extremely thoughtful. She understands what a pet means to a family. She allowed our family private time to say goodbye and helped us keep our composure during the process. Dr Briell explained step by step the procedure she was about to perform and ensured us Willie would suffer no pain. She kept her word and Willie passed very peacefully. Out of her kindness she gave us Willie's paw prints and later a beautiful card was mailed to us. Dr Briell is a very caring and special person. She gets a very high recommendation from us.

## Pet euthanasia and cremation pricing in Charleston, SC

### Reservations and payments

Your credit card is required to reserve your appointment. However, no payment is required until the appointment and nothing is due until the appointment is completed

### Cancellation policy or pet passing

We charge cancellation fee of $100 if an appointment is cancelled less than 4 hours before the start time. If your pet passes away before your appointment you would not be charged a cancellation fee. If the vet you scheduled is able, and you would like their assistance with cremation, then pickup fee would apply instead of euthanasia fee

[Personalize Quote](/schedule-appointment "Personalize Quote")

## Other Consideration

### Large Animals

If you have a larger pet, your vet may need the help of one friend or family member. Talk to your vet about options and limitations when they reach out to you prior to your appointment, and they will inform you of any extra cost for your situation. 

### How do I get my pet’s ashes

Options for your pets return home and memorabilia depend on your local provider. Your vet coordinate the return of your pet’s ashes and let you know if there are additional fees for urn delivery. 

### Special factors affecting price

Extra time or medications needed can affect the total price. Other factors can be if it is decided that it’s not time to euthanize your pet after the vet has arrive. In that case, only the travel fee, platform fee, and a quality of life consult would apply. 

## FAQs

### What’s included in the total cost?

The total cost includes the in-home pet euthanasia service fee, any travel fee (if any apply), and a platform fee. Additionally, depending on your choice, fees may apply for cremation services or keepsakes.

### Will the vet take my pet with them after the appointment?

During your appointment, your vet will confirm your aftercare selection with you. If you choose to arrange cremation services, your vet will oversee your pet’s transportation to a local facility for cremation. If your preferred cremation option includes the return of your pet’s ashes to you, your vet will discuss the process to reunite you with your pet's ashes and the anticipated time frame during your appointment

### Will the vet examine my pet once they get to my home?

Yes, upon arrival the veterinarian will assess your pet. This can look different than an “nose to tail” examination in a clinic setting and will focus more on the pet’s history and quality of life.

### What if I am not sure it is time?

It is not uncommon to have doubts about whether the time is right. If you’ve taken the Quality of Life Questionnaire and are still unsure, we recommend consulting with your family veterinarian before scheduling an appointment.  
  
Rest assured, if you book an appointment, your in-home euthanasia veterinarian will let you know if they do not believe that euthanasia is appropriate at this time.

### How long will the procedure take?

You can expect your veterinarian to be in your home from 20-60 minutes, depending on how much of that time you need or want throughout the process.

### What is at home pet euthanasia, and how does it work?

At home pet euthanasia allows your pet to pass away peacefully in the comfort of your home surrounded by love. A compassionate veterinarian will provide end-of-life care for your pet starting with an initial end-of-life exam followed by sedation to ensure your pet is comfortable. Your vet will always move at your pace so you have the time you need to say your goodbyes. Once you are ready, your vet will administer medication to help them gently and painlessly say goodbye surrounded by comfort and love.

### How do I tell if my pet is suffering?

This is one of the hardest questions to answer as a pet parent, because we don’t want to “see”our pet suffer. We feel terrible guilt when we know that our pet is suffering, and so often we will just deny what is happening because it is an awful feeling to address.This is a common experience, one of which I have gone through as well. Having a veterinarian help you determine QOL is so helpful. Some ways that we determine quality of life are by looking at your pet as a whole. Some questions to consider are: Are they happy to see you when you come through the door? Do they still want to play and interact with you? Are they still eating and drinking?Are they able to get up and go outside and go to the bathroom? Are they having any physical difficulties like vomiting, diarrhea, seizures, decreased mentation, rouble breathing and immobility? Are they having more bad days than good? Do they have a terminal illness? Remember animals do NOT show pain like we would. They will not cry or whine unless it is SEVERE. It is a survival tool that is embedded in their DNA to not show pain as it is considered a ‘weakness” in nature.

It is sometimes much easier to see your pet objectively for a brief moment in order to assess these questions logically. Then when you have answered these questions, kept a daily log for a few days, you will have more information that can help you decide if there is more medically that can be done to help, or if it is time to give them the gift of a peaceful transition in the comfort of your own home surrounded by all their loved ones.

### What should I do if my pet is declining fast?

If your pet's health is declining rapidly, it’s crucial to take the following steps:  


  * **Consult Your Veterinarian** : Schedule an appointment to discuss your observations and any scoring from a quality-of-life scale. This information can help guide the conversation about your pet's condition and options moving forward. Your vet may suggest palliative care, hospice, or, if necessary, euthanasia.



  * **Ensure Comfort** : Create a quiet, cozy space with soft bedding and easy access to food, water, and a litter box (if applicable).



  * **Minimize Stress** : Keep routines simple and familiar, and limit loud noises or disruptions.  

  * **Offer Gentle Care** : Provide soothing touch through gentle petting and offer favorite treats if they can still eat.  

  * **Consider At-Home Euthanasia** : If appropriate, discuss the option of at-home euthanasia with your vet for a peaceful and familiar passing.  

  * **Reach Out for Support** : It's okay to lean on loved ones, pet-loss support groups, or counselors to help navigate this difficult time.



  
If you're noticing signs of declining health, we encourage you to use our [quality of life scale resource tool](https://www.codapet.com/quality-of-life-scale) to evaluate your pet's condition before your vet visit.

### What is the difference between in home pet euthanasia and euthanasia at a vet clinic?

The key difference is the setting. In home euthanasia allows your pet to pass peacefully in the comfort of their familiar surroundings, reducing stress and anxiety. This option especially benefits pets who may feel scared or uncomfortable traveling to a clinic. It also offers your family a private, intimate experience during this emotional time. While some urgent situations don’t allow for time to schedule in-home euthanasia, many pet owners in Charleston choose in-home services for the peaceful atmosphere and compassionate care their pets receive right where they feel safest. You can [find flexible availability](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment) for our local vets here, or look for [same-day euthanasia](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request) appointments.

### Will my pet experience any pain during euthanasia?

No, pet euthanasia at home is designed to be completely painless. After an initial end-of-life assessment, your veterinarian will first administer a sedative to ensure your pet is relaxed and comfortable. The euthanasia medication then gently stops the heart without causing pain. The process is peaceful and allows your pet to pass without distress.

Once you have picked your provider, the cost will usuallydepend on your pet’s size and any additional services you may choose, such as cremation, keepsakes, or other services. Our services start with a base fee of $320 for in home euthanasia. If your vet is traveling further than their local area, there is a travel fee applied based on how far you are from them.

### Is the cost of euthanasia for dogs and cats the same?

Most providers in Charleston charge a flat fee for euthanasia, although some providers do charge based on the size of your pet, so small dogs and cats can be the same price; however, medium or large size dogs (such as Bulldogs, Australian Shepherds, Labradors, or German Shepherds) will likely carry a higher price. At CodaPet, most vets charge a flat fee for both dogs and cats; however, if there is a large pet fee, it will be applied automatically for you to review in the price estimate when you reserve an appointment.

### What should I expect during an in home pet euthanasia appointment?

Here is what Dr. Lara Allison say, one of our local veterinarian:

  
"When you first book an appointment, I will reach out as soon as possibleto confirm the appointment and to see if you have any questions or concerns. From that point on you will have my personal cell phone number in case your pet’s condition changes or worsens. When I arrive at your house, I will do everything possible to make sure your pet does not feel alarmed or scared. I am there to hold a loving, nurturing and compassionate space for you, your family and your pet. I want to get to know you and your pet, so I often ask questions to learn about all of you. I then will also gently explain the process and answer any questions or concerns at that time. I will then perform a physical exam to ensure that I have chosen the best protocol for a peaceful transition for your pet. I usually perform a 2 step sedation process, as I find that giving just one sedative can sting and they fall asleep so quickly that it can be alarming to some. With a 2 step, there is no discomfort with the first injection and they gently drift off to a peaceful state where they are still aware of you, however they are pain free and comfortable. This is also a place in the processto spend some time alone with your pet to say whatever it is you want them to know, as they are lightly sleeping yet are aware that you are there with them. I then give a second injection which induces a deeper state of sedation, like anesthesia. This is to ensure that your pet is completely unaware of the final injection and that in no way can they feel or experience any kind of pain or discomfort what so ever. The exception to this protocol, only occurs in an emergent state where the process needs to be speeded up in order to avoid any suffering in the part of your pet. The final injection is given in a vein and is administered slowly in order to avoid any reactions. Unfortunately sometimes, due to illness and/or age, the veins can be compromised and then an area in the belly or chest needs to be accessed. Just know that if this were to happen, your pet is completely in a deep anesthetic state and will not feel or experience anything uncomfortable. This injection is very peaceful in that it goes directly to the brain centers that control the heart and breathing. Your pet will gently stop breathing. His or her last memories will be filled with the love and peace they felt all around them. Being at home with your pet is probably the single best gift we can give them. Afterwards, when you have had plenty of time to say goodbye, I will gently transport your pet in my personal car directly to the crematorium, Mcalister-Smith Funeral home." - Dr. Lara Allison

### Can I choose a specific veterinarian for my pet’s euthanasia?

Yes, you can always choose the veterinarian you prefer, at the times they have available to reserve. You can see their [real-time availability](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment) or request a [same-day urgent appointment](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request) if no time suits your needs.

### Who are the veterinarians providing at-home pet euthanasia services in Charleston?

If you're searching for at-home pet euthanasia in La Jolla and the surrounding areas, you're in compassionate hands with our local veterinarian. Below, you can learn more about their professional journey and what inspired them to offer peaceful in-home euthanasia services.

  * **Dr. Lara Allison** is a compassionate veterinarian with over 29 years of experience, dedicated to supporting pets and their families during life’s most challenging transitions. Growing up in Georgia surrounded by beloved cats, dogs, and horses, Dr. Allison’s dream of becoming a veterinarian was fostered from a young age. She earned both her Bachelor’s and Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degrees from the University of Georgia, completing her DVM in 1995.  
  
Dr. Allison’s calling to in-home euthanasia was profoundly influenced by her first experience with her mother’s dog, Smokey, who passed peacefully in his favorite spot by the riverbank. Witnessing how the calm, natural setting eased both Smokey and her mother inspired Dr. Allison to offer this same sense of peace and closure to others. Dr. Allison believes that a pet’s final moments should be filled with love and gratitude, surrounded by familiar sights, sounds, and the comfort of their home. Her practice focuses on honoring this bond, helping families create lasting memories and offering pets a gentle, dignified farewell.

  * **Dr. Briell Dzierga** has had a lifelong passion for animals that began with drawing them as a child, sparking her eventual journey to becoming a veterinarian. Born and raised in rural Massachusetts, she pursued a Bachelor’s degree in Animal Science and Technology at the University of Rhode Island, graduating in 2014, followed by her Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree from The Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine in 2018.  
  
Throughout her career, Dr. Dzierga has worked with a diverse range of species, from biomedical primates to large and small animals, which has deepened her dedication to high-quality, compassionate care.

For Dr. Dzierga, being able to offer both pets and their families this level of dignity and comfort during their final moments is her highest priority.

Each of these veterinarians is dedicated to making end-of-life care a compassionate and meaningful experience for both pets and their families.

### Do you offer any quality-of-life consultations?

Yes, your local veterinarian offers in-person and tele-consults depending on availability for a separate fee. In order to reserve a time to speak with a local veterinarian, please call **833-263-2738**.

  
**Note** : This consultation is aimed at providing advice on end-of-life care and quality-of-life questions. Your veterinarian is not offering telemedicine and is not able to provide specific diagnosis or treatments. If you have any medical needs, please visit your primary care veterinarian.

###  How far in advance do I need to make an appointment?

The notice for every veterinarian differs, however, most veterinarians require at least a 2-hour notice from the time you need them to arrive at your home. This allows them time to prepare and ensure they can provide the highest level of care and compassion for your pet. It also accounts for their travel time, as your veterinarian may be traveling from many different locations around Charleston.

  
While you can request a [same-day and emergency services](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request), it's always best to contact us as early as possible to ensure availability and to give both you and your veterinarian time to prepare for this important moment.

### What should I expect in terms of my pet’s behavior during the pet euthanasia process?

During the euthanasia process, your pet will be gently guided to a state of peace and comfort. After a sedative is administered, you can expect them to become calm and relaxed, free from any pain or distress. When the final injection is given, your pet will slowly drift off into a deep sleep before passing away peacefully. Your compassionate veterinarian will ensure the process is as gentle and serene as possible, allowing you to be present with your beloved companion in their final moments of love and care.

### Can I be with my pet during the euthanasia process?

Yes, during the in home euthanasia process, you are encouraged to be with your pet throughout the entire process. Being there provides comfort and reassurance to your pet as they pass peacefully.

### How do I know when it’s time to consider euthanasia for my pet?

Every pet is different, and you know yours better than anyone, however, it may be time to consider euthanasia when you notice more ‘bad days than good’. It’s important to keep an eye on your pet’s quality of life and try to understand when it has declined, such as no longer enjoying activities or suffering from unmanageable pain. To help you understand their quality of live, you take a [Quality of Life Assessment](https://www.codapet.com/quality-of-life-scale), which helps you get a more a clear picture of your pet’s well-being at this point in time.

Remember, if you are unsure, speaking with your primary care veterinarian can help better understand your pet’s quality of life. It’s important to speak with your primary care veterinarian if you haven’t yet to understand your pet’s health. If you do not have a primary care veterinarian, consider visiting an urgent care or emergency hospital in your area.  
  
We asked one of our local veterinarian and here is what they had to say:   
  
_"It is time to considereuthanasia when your pet’s quality of life is declining and all medical options have been either exhausted, or they are just not an option. Taking a quality of life assessment or having a veterinarian help you decide can be paramount in helping to make this decision as well. When you can measure objectively and logically what quality of life means to your pet, and you determine that they are surviving and not thriving. If your pet has a terminal illness or condition, it is important to be prepared for euthanasia in order to help them transition before they are painful or having difficulty breathing, for example. A question to ask yourself is 'Why Wait?'"- Dr. Lara Allison_

###  How should I prepare my home for my pet’s euthanasia?

Everyone’s experience in saying goodbye to their beloved companion is different and very personal. It’s important to consider that you know your pet best. Some considerations, however, are choosing a comfortable space where your pet feels safe, sometimes their favorite spot in your home. Another consideration can be to gather any family members who wish to be present and feel free to bring your pet’s favorite blanket or toys, etc that make them feel comfortable. When your veterinarian arrives they will guide you through each step in the process and help you move at your pace to ensure the process is as peaceful as possible.

### How long does the euthanasia procedure typically take?

_"The length of the actual procedure at home is a lot more flexible than if you were in a clinical setting, and it is based on your pet’s condition and on how much time your family needs. I have spent anywhere from 5minutes (due to an emergent state) to over 2 hrs. I allow 3 hours between appointments to ensure that no-one ever feels rushed during this tender and sacred moment. In summary, from sedation to transition can take 5-20 minutes." -_ Dr. Lara Allison  


We understand that saying goodbye is a deeply emotional experience, and we encourage families to take as much time as they need during the process. Our goal is to create a peaceful and compassionate environment for both you and your pet.

### What should I do after the euthanasia procedure is completed?

After the euthanasia, you are welcome to spend as much time as you need with your pet to say goodbye. If you’ve chosen any cremation services to handle your pet’s body, your veterinarian will reconfirm your choices and gently transport your pet when you are ready. If you’ve chosen any keepsakes offered by the crematorium, like Claw Paw Prints, Ink nose prints, or other memorabilia, your veterinarian will reconfirm your choices before leaving your home. If you have any questions or want to change your mind about any of your choices, you can discuss your options with your veterinarian before they leave your home.

### What are my options for cremation?

After the in home euthanasia procedure, your veterinarian will provide you with time to say goodbye to your pet. Once you're ready, they will re-confirm the preferred aftercare option that you choose when reserving your time with your veterinarian. In Charleston you can select three types of cremation services:  


  * **Individual Cremation (Ashes Returned)** : An individual cremation is a process where your pet will be cremated separated with physical barriers in the chamber. This ensures the separation with other pets in the chamber so you may reunite with your pet’s ashes. Your pet’s ashes will be returned to you in an urn of your choice. If you choose an additional urn then your pet’s ashes will be returned in the urn of your choice.  

  * **Communal Cremation (No Ashes Returned)** : A communal cremation is a process where your pet is cremated in a chamber with other pets. Once the process is complete, the crematorium will respectfully scatter your pet’s remains among other pets. It’s important to note, you pet’s ashes will not be returned to you.



  
Some of our veterinarians offer an additional option known as **Private Cremation (Ashes Returned)**. In this option, only your pet is in the cremation chamber, ensuring that the recovered ashes are solely your pet's. These ashes can be returned in an urn of your choice, with additional urn options available. To see if private cremation is available with your provider, please refer to our [booking page](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment).

**Local Veterinarian Insights on Aftercare Services**

"_I use Mcalister-Smith Funeral Home because they are a locally, family owned business that has been around since 1886. When I met Gia Kondakor, their Pet Loss Director, I was so impressed with how honest, organized, caring and knowledgeable she is about pet loss and their aftercare. Her staff is also compassionate, caring and so helpful and professional. They truly are committed to providing graceful and dignified after care for your pets. Their protocol for ensuring that your pet comes back just as your pet is excellent. They understand how much we love our pets and how important this step is in reuniting pets with their loved ones._ " - Dr. Lara Allison

  
  
**Note** : If you choose to leave your pet's body with your veterinarian, rest assured it will be handled with the utmost care, respect, and dignity. Your veterinarian will coordinate all aftercare arrangements as requested, allowing you to focus on yourself and your family after this difficult goodbye.

### How do I get my pet’s ashes back?

Your veterinarian will coordinate the return of your pet’s ashes before they leave your home. Your options include having your pet’s remains delivered by your veterinarian (for an additional fee), shipping them to you (for an additional fee), or picking them up from your primary clinic or the crematorium.

### Are there any low-cost or no-cost solutions?

Saying goodbye to a beloved pet is never easy, and we understand that cost can be a concern for many pet parents. While we specialize in premium in-home euthanasia services, we also want to acknowledge that cost may be a concern. If you're looking for low-cost options in Charleston, consider reaching out to the following:

  * **Local Animal Shelters & Humane Societies** – Many provide low-cost or donation-based euthanasia services, often with cremation options.  

  * **Low-Cost Veterinary Clinics & Nonprofits** – Some vet clinics and nonprofits offer reduced-cost euthanasia, sometimes supported by grants or donations.  

  * **Animal Control Services** – In certain cases, local animal control agencies may offer euthanasia services for terminally ill or suffering pets at a lower cost.



**Note:** When considering a low-cost pet euthanasia option, it's important to call ahead to check availability, as some providers may require an appointment or have eligibility criteria, such as income-based assistance. Be sure to ask about additional costs, including cremation or aftercare services, which may not be included in the base price. Additionally, verify service details, as some options may have restrictions based on your pet’s size, health condition, or location.

While low-cost options are available, many pet parents choose in-home euthanasia to ensure a peaceful, stress-free farewell in the comfort of their home. If you're looking for a private, compassionate experience, we’re here to help.

I wanted to thank Laura for being so compassionate during probably the toughest time in my life and guide me through. Laure was very willing to let you vacillate back and forth on decisions as most of us do in a situation like this she was willing to listen to us and our beloved family member and help us make informed thought out decisions. Our loved one got very sick in the night and Laura was here first thing to help with this situation we hoped would never come. If it had not been for Laura, I am not sure I would have any mind left. Laura helped us work through the entire process and you could tell could feel what we felt. Thank you for being there for us in our time of need. You are a true friend and am so glad you entered our life’s to help make this unbearable situation more manageable. Laura gave us a hair clipping from our loved one and he still goes with us to all of his favorite places. It helps us remember he is still with us.

> Dr. Orth was wonderful! She responded very quickly, which seemed like a miracle for us. She was very thorough and kind with our distressed older cat. She quickly assessed our cat Ronnie and agreed it was time. She explained what she would do and what would happen. She was very gentle and kind with our pet. She arrived totally prepared and acted to calm Ronnie and make the visit as comforting as possible. We can’t say enough good things about her professionalism and kindness to our pet and my husband and me. It’s very clear she loves animals. We would highly recommend her to help your cat in Sanger, CA area.

> After making the difficult decision to help our elderly bulldog cross the rainbow bridge, we found CodaPet online, offering in-home euthanasia. Our dog was a large breed and could hardly walk, and I couldn’t bear the thought of transporting her to a cold clinic for her final moments with us. Dr. Michelli arrived at our home and was so kind and gentle with our sweet girl; she explained to us how things would work and gave us time to answer any questions. We were so thankful to be able to say our final goodbyes to our fur baby in the privacy of our home and with her in the comfort of her own bed. Our hearts are broken by the loss, but I couldn’t have wished for a better way to have gone about this experience. Thank you, Dr. M and CodaPet. 🙏🏻🌈

> We had a sudden need for home pet euthanasia for our beloved little dog, Jellybean. None of our local vets offered the service timely, so we had to try an unknown. I found CodaPet online and there were appointments available. Dr. Gordon at CodaPet was wonderful. The whole process went smoothly. Communication was thorough. She was a little late, but kept us updated (because you can't rush these things). She said all the right things and comforted us in our decision. We are heartbroken, but at least this part will be a good memory. Our pup was at home, peaceful, and not stressed out by being at the vet. We pet him, cried, told stories, and he just fell asleep. People who provide this service are special people. We SO appreciated being home for his final day. We would not hesitate to recommend Dr. Gordon if you unfortunately need this service.

> Using CodaPet was so easy; from searching for a vet near me to clear pricing. Once booked they remained in constant communication with me throughout the process, providing time updates, etc. Our family was matched with Dr.Kelsey Jones and I can not recommend her enough. She arrived promptly, listened to our concerns, examined our furbaby Ciddy and gave us ample time to grieve and make the final decision. At no moment did I feel pressured to rush. She gave us time to set up an area outside and spoke to us like a friend throughout the process, while treating all of us with respect and compassion. She even made a suggestion on how to allow our other dog to say goodbye (which I would never have thought of). It’s not an easy choice to let go of a beloved pet but i feel this was the best way to do it and highly recommend her services.

> Dr. Lara was such a blessing to us. She was so kind, sensitive, and respectful to my dog and what we were going through. Having my dog cross the rainbow bridge at home was such a gift. Thank goodness there are people like Dr. Lara to help people say goodbye to their beloved pets in a way that is the least stressful for everyone.

> We recently had to make the heartbreaking decision to say goodbye to our beloved dog, Fritz. Dr. Allison treated us and our pet with the utmost compassion, respect, and kindness. She gave us time, comfort, and space to say goodbye, and explained everything gently so we knew what to expect. It was one of the hardest moments of our lives, but we are forever grateful for the care and dignity she provided. I would highly recommend Dr. Allison to anyone needing support during such a difficult time.

> Dr. Clark could not have been a more kind, compassionate and patient veterinarian. He’s also very experienced and made what I expected to be a traumatic experience (in home pet euthanasia) as peaceful as it could be and I will be forever grateful for that. I felt awful that I waited a day or two too long before making the decision, but having Dr. Clark be the one to help us was the right choice. We’ll now be taking our other dog to his practice for care.

> The time had come for our 14-year-old Golden Retriever, Katie, to be put to sleep. We wanted Katie’s last moments to be at home in familiar surroundings with her family. Dr. Allison, explained the procedures and told us exactly what to expect. After giving Katie the mild sedative, Dr. Allison gently wrapped Katie into a fluffy cozy blanket and placed a blanket/pillow under her head for support. When everything was in place, Dr. Allison administered the final medication, and Katie passed peacefully into her heavenly sleep. We can not say enough about how pleased we were with Dr. Allison and how she helped us through this difficult time. She was very kind and compassionate, she did not rush anything and was very sensitive to our needs. We wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Lara Allison in helping us to help our precious baby girl go over the Rainbow Bridge.

> Dr. Allison came to our home to help us say goodbye to our beloved dog, and I am so grateful I am for her care. I have known Dr. Allison for many years and the care and professionalism I have experienced with her has always been above and beyond. She was flexible, incredibly kind, and deeply comforting during a hard time. She explained everything gently, moved at our pace, and treated Patsy with dignity and compassion. Being able to do this at home was such a blessing for both me and my dog, and Dr. Allison made a difficult situation far less stressful. I am truly thankful for her empathy and professionalism during this difficult time.

From the moment she arrived, we felt respected—not only in our home, but throughout the entire process. I didn’t even realize in-home euthanasia was an option, and I can honestly say the experience was as peaceful and comforting as it could possibly be.

From the moment she arrived at our home, she brought a sense of peace, compassion, and comfort that helped ease the weight of such a difficult decision. She treated Annie with the utmost gentleness and respect. She took the time to explain everything with patience and care, allowing us the space we needed to say our goodbyes without feeling rushed or overwhelmed. Her presence turned what could have been a cold and clinical experience into something tender, humane, and full of love. We will forever be thankful for the way Dr. Lara helped Annie pass peacefully, in the comfort of her home, surrounded by those who loved her most. It takes a truly special person to do what she does, and we feel so fortunate that it was her who guided us through this painful moment, she’s truly an angel on earth! If you ever find yourself in the heartbreaking position of needing this service, know that Dr. Lara Allison will not only provide the highest level of professionalism, but will also bring genuine compassion and grace when you need it most.

The service she provides allowed my sweet cat, Opie, to cross the rainbow bridge in my arms in the bedroom where he had slept for most of his life. Dr Allison explained thoroughly each step of the procedure as well as Opie’s response so well that I actually felt comfortable participating in his transition. Opie never seemed to be stressed or uncomfortable. He seemed to be at peace, as was I. I recommend highly Dr Lara Allison for end of life/transition care.
