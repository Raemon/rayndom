Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

Euthanasia is a personal, private decision that should be stress free. At home euthanasia provides the owner with a procedure that can take place in a personal, private place that is familiar to the pet. I enjoy interacting with owners and pets, learning their stories

## What pet parents are saying

> Dr.Fowler made an extremely difficult decision and experience much less stressful than we expected. She was compassionate, patient, and explained every step with care. She helped us make paw print stamps and collect some of our dog’s fur before taking her for cremation. Her empathy and professionalism brought us a lot of comfort on one of the hardest days of our lives. We’re deeply grateful. Thank you Brianna!

> I found out about Codapet Home Service thru a co-worker at my hospital and I'm so Happy I used their Excellent service. Booking my home appt during this difficult time was convenient and easy to meet my needs. Codapet pet staff was so helpful and answered any questions or concerns that I had including Dr. Brianna Fowler who personally sent a text or I could call her personally if I had any concerns...There was no hidden fees,extra charges or changes in your cost that was quoted and many options available for cremation if needed. I had my own already with no worries orr sales pitch from any Staff...Dr Fowler was so professional, kind & caring when handling my sweet little boy Peanie and gave me whatever time I needed to Say Goodbye thru out the process. He never was in any Pain as I held my little boy for the last time on my lap for initial shot to make him comfortable and fall asleep.. Dr Fowler helped me put my dog's favorite comfy bed up on my table for the 2nd shot. Dr Fowler offerered me such support & kindness which means alot to me! She cares about your animals which us plain to see in a person...CODAPET is exceptional and I'll be using their services again...Thank you Codapet and God Bless you all in having this Home Euthanasia Personalized Service available in comfort of are homes Versus sitting in a waiting room..Sincerely KS
