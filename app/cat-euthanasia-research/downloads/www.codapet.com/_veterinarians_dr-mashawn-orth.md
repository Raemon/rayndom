Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

While I loved healthy puppy, kitten, and even reptile visits, I soon realized that sometimes a vet's job also necessitates relieving suffering and helping pets to pass peacefully. To be able to further experience and support the bond between humans and their pets has been an honor that I am truly grateful for. I believe that euthanasia in our pet’s homes is a peaceful, loving, and more comfortable way to help them pass, surrounded by the people they love. Family is so important and our pets make up such a special role in our lives.

## What pet parents are saying

> Dr. Orth was lovely to work with from start to finish. She exhibited such quiet compassion throughout the entire process and made a painful experience bearable by centering our family and making space for us to go through everything we needed to. Dr. Orth walked me through the entire process the night before, despite the late hour. She arrived on time and explained everything to us before and as she was doing it. Though I don't wish the experience of losing a beloved pet on anybody, if they must go through it I would wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Orth to be their guide in the process. Thanks to her, our boy was able to pass peacefully in his home surrounded by the people who loved him the most. We are eternally grateful for everything she did for us.

> Dr. Orth was professional, compassionate, and patient. She explained the process to us and answered all the questions we had. Most importantly to me, she didn't make us feel rushed. She had a calming presence and we knew we were in good hands. She treated our pup with care and supported us all through the difficult choice to let our sweet boy go. You are in good hands with Dr. Orth.

> I am writing to share my recent experience with one specific vet, with the hope that my feedback will help others. Last Monday, I did not have a pleasant experience with the veterinarian who came to our home, Dr. Orth. I made the appointment through Coda Pet and called her directly, the main purpose being to connect with her emotionally since she would be involved in such a significant event in our lives. She called me back on Sunday night (the night before our appointment) and left a message saying that Sundays are her “family day” and to text her with any questions. My husband called her anyway, and explained to her that our pet was like our child since we do not have human children and that our main focus was to be as sensitive and kind as possible. The point didn’t seem to get across as she still seemed distant and technical. At the time of the appointment, she was late because she didn’t fully read the notes I had given Coda Pet for our address. This made me wonder if I had included any other important notes, whether she would have bothered to read those either. When she arrived, I still hoped to make some kind of connection. I told her, “You smell nice,” but she looked at me and somehow misheard me and said, “Do I smoke?” She then tried to make small talk, and at some point called my boy a “fluffy cotton ball,” which was uncomfortable and not appropriate given the circumstance. The process itself did not go well. The initial injection was intramuscular and excruciating for my boy, and he cried a lot. I’m not sure if there was a gentler way to administer it, perhaps a subq lidocaine injection prior would have made the caustic intramuscular injection more tolerable. As he got sleepy, I held my boy in my arms. I requested that I want to hold him, and was assured he would pass in my arms. But after poking him a couple of times, she was not able to get a vein. She had him lie down on my leg, where she proceeded to inject him in the liver. I was unprepared for this, as I was told I would hold him the entire time. She then listened to his heart with a stethoscope and specifically said, “I WILL TELL YOU WHEN HE IS CLOSE," giving me the impression I would be able to pick him up and hold him before he passed. She listened for a few minutes as I stared at the stethoscope, laser focused on the blinking light, waiting for her to tell me it’s close so I can lift him and hold him. But instead, she said “He’s gone, I’m sorry.” I didn’t even get to hold him like I was promised. She said she would tell me when he was close, but she didn’t. And I didn’t know when my boy left us. Then, minutes after she left, she texted my husband and I that the credit card was not processing. We thought Coda Pet had already run the card without issues. Regardless, she could have demonstrated some compassion and patience, as we were in the peak of our grief. Overall, the experience was businesslike, rushed, and lacked compassion. It was disheartening and one that will stay with me forever.

Veterinarians should make it a point to contact the family prior to the appointment. This can provide an opportunity to build a connection, explain the process, and give an understanding of what to expect. And most crucial of all, veterinarians can take a moment to ask and become aware of what is important to the family during this momentous time.

> Recently, I had to say goodbye to my 4-legged daughter of 13 years, and it was a very difficult emotional choice I had to make. I didn’t want Mari's last moments to be in a cold, noisy vet’s office. I wanted something more peaceful for her, so after asking a friend for a recommendation, I found out about Codapet. I called Codapet around noon that day, and by 3 pm, Dr. Mashawn was at my home. She was incredibly genuine and gentle with my little girl, giving us all the time we needed to say our goodbyes. Dr. Mashawn took the time to explain everything to my family, ensuring we understood what was happening at each step. I also appreciated the text messages and follow-up emails she sent to offer support, especially as I was grieving. When Mari’s ashes were ready, I couldn’t leave work to pick them up, but Dr. Mashawn’s husband went above and beyond by delivering them to my office. Losing a furry family member is never easy, but if you find yourself in that situation, I highly recommend Codapet.

> I was displeased with the whole experience of Coda Pet. We decided on a Thursday evening to put our dog down but Coda Pet had no openings until Monday; it was very difficult waiting 3 days for an appointment. We had used a different Vet when we had to put our lab down in December, 2022; they had an immediate opening when we decided it was time to put our lab down. Dr. Orth had a pleasant demeanor but was not very engaging. She did not speak to us very much, did not ask questions about our dog and seemed distracted. In December, 2022 we had another dog euthanized by a different Vet that was so kind, compassionate, empathetic and engaging. She was not a part of Coda Pet at that time and I requested her again for my dog since she is now with Coda Pet but she only does dogs over 30 pounds. Dr. Orth did not leave us with the keepsake paw print like the previous Vet did with our lab. I had to call and ask Dr. Orth after she left to request one and she was not able to bring it back to us. I called her within just a few minutes of her leaving my home. Also, I had not received my dog's ashes and it had been almost 3 weeks. I had to text Dr. Orth to ask her about my dog's ashes. I texted her on a Thursday and she wasn't sure if she received the ashes but she would check when she got home and if the ashes were at her home, she couldn't bring them until Tuesday. I told her in my text to her that I was hoping to have my dog back home as soon as possible. Dr. Orth called me a couple of hours later to tell me her husband would bring my dog's ashes, along with the keepsake paw print. The Vet that put our first dog down contacted us to bring her ashes home and it only took a few days. The first experience we had when we put our lab down was a completely different experience than what we had with Coda Pet and Dr. Orth.

> We are forever thankful for this amazing group’s services. We have used CodaPet in the past, and as we knew it was our sweet girl’s time to move on we chose to book again. Roux passed on her own before Dr. Orth’s scheduled time (later at night the night before). When I canceled the appointment via the website, she reached out by text to ask if we wanted her to send out her husband to pick her up and contribute with the cremation as I had originally booked. He did this late at night, and was kind, calm and caring despite our house being in shock and experiencing unbelievable grief. Roux was returned to us today, with the same caring and attention to our feelings. There were even small rocks painted for us in her honor. Losing these dogs is so painful, but having the gift of helping them leave us with dignity and grace and love is more than we could ask for. CodaPet’s doctors and their family members who assist in the process are angels on earth.
