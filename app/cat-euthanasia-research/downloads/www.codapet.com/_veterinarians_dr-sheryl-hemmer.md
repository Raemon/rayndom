## What pet parents are saying

> Our experience with Dr. Hemmer was excellent. Our KC dog was had fought so hard and was ready to be at rest. That did not make the process of letting him go any less painful, however Dr. Hemmer was very patient with us through the entrire process. Not rushing us at all. It was a very peaceful goodbye.

> This was one of the hardest things we have had to face. But Dr. Hemmer was absolutely a god-send for this experience. She was kind and caring and lead us through everything with empathy. We were so sad and heart-broken but each step was explained and she gave us our time and don’t rush anything. We feel so fortunate to have had Dr. Hemmer with us through this. I would highly recommend these services for anyone facing this hard decision.

> To those who are about to experience the loss of a beloved pet, At first, I didn’t really know how the in-home pet euthanasia process worked, nor was I really aware it was an option before I found the idea from a co-worker and found CodaPet. I was filled with anxiety, not only about my own worries of whether or not it was a real service, but also because the reality of making the decision to let go of my pet just felt all too “raw”. After making the decision and finally giving them the call, I was welcomed by a truly empathetic and kind spirited phone representative, who made the set up process convenient, affordable, and easy to work through. They scheduled our service with the closest and best available Doctor in my area, making the process as stress free as possible. When the day finally came and Dr. Sheryl Hemmer arrived at our home, although we felt the pain in our hearts for the impending loss of our loved one, her presence was as if we were greeting an old friend that you haven’t seen in a long time. Dr. Hemmer was welcoming, loving, professional, powerfully empathetic, and made the process of helping our pet move on to the next life as painless and comfortable as it could possibly be. Words cannot describe my gratitude for the exceptional service we were provided. It made the burden of losing our animal just a bit easier to bear, and will be my only method of euthanasia for every pet I own. Thank you Dr. Hemmer, and thank you CodaPet for providing a truly invaluable service.

> Dr. Hemmer was in touch with us within a few hours of our booking to learn about our cat Calli and the details of our situation. We so appreciated her communicativeness and willingness to work with us, as we needed to tweak the time of our appointment. She has an amazing bedside manner. She was so gentle with both our dear Calli and us throughout our last hour together. She is such a sweet, compassionate soul. We highly recommend her services.

> Dr Hemmer was great and helped my pet and me though a difficult decision. Dr Hemmer's kindness and empathy allowed me to understand that this was the best course for my dog Princess and me. Princess had been with me for about 17 years. Dr Hemmer was kind, understanding, and respectful and the process was peaceful and loving. Thank you for that human touch professionalism.

> Dr. Hemmer was incredible. We could not have asked for a nicer farewell to our bulldog Biscuit. She was patient and super supportive. At no point did we feel rushed, she sat and spent time with Biscuit and was genuinely interested in our stories about her. Extremely professional and helped with the perfect farewell. I cannot recommend Dr. Hemmer enough.

> Sheryl was an absolute blessing to our family. She made sure we were all comfortable and knew exactly what to expect, step by step. Our Rhodey was surrounded by all his loved ones, in his own comfortable setting right up to the moment he passed. We are so lucky to have honored him in this way! I cannot express our appreciation enough!

> I wanted to express my deepest gratitude for the compassionate care you provided during one of the most difficult moments of my life. Saying goodbye to my beloved cat, Tinker, was incredibly heartbreaking, but your kindness and professionalism made the process more bearable. Your willingness to perform the euthanasia at home allowed Tinker to be in a familiar and comforting environment during her final moments. This meant the world to me and helped ease the pain of losing my precious companion. Your empathy and gentle approach provided much-needed comfort during this emotional time. Thank you for your exceptional care and for helping Tinker pass peacefully at home. Your support and understanding have been a great source of comfort, and I am forever grateful.

> Dr Hemmer was such a light in a dark day for our family. Jake our 15 year old was ready to move on but he kept hanging on because I feel he knew we weren’t quite ready. But after coming home from vacation I knew it was time for me to make the decision. He was so miserable. To have Dr Hemmer come to our house was a blessing because Jake hated car rides so he would have had a traumatic last few hours. This way he was able to pass peacefully at home surrounded by all of us, even his best bud, our cat Tank. She was so sweet and very calming for all of us. I will use her again when it’s Tanks time. Thank you Dr Hemmer ❤️

> It was so amazing to have such a wonderful.compassionate and caring provider to help our family with such a difficult time. Dr. Hemmer was absolutely amazing from my first contact with her I knew my decision to choose this option and provider was right. I can’t praise her enough with mere words. I miss my Grizzy Bear every single day since her passing but I know she passed in the most gentle way, with kind and loving care. My children were all with her and I was able to lay down with her and feel last beat of her heart. I never sensed any bit of fear, pain or stress in her and I know she left me in the most gentle way. I am forever grateful for Dr Hemmer’s care and I know she cared for my dog in the exact way she would have wanted her pet cared for! Thank you so much.

> It's so hard to leave a positive review on such a difficult matter, but Dr. Sheryl Hemmer was a blessing. Reggie was a giant breed, and the attempts to load him in a vehicle was stressful on all of us. This option allowed him to be safe in his home, surrounded by people he loved, with minimal stress on us both. I wanted him to pass with love and kindness. Dr. Sheryl Hemmer helped that happen.
