When families in Knoxville and the surrounding communities face the difficult decision of saying goodbye to a beloved pet, Dr. Mackenzie Treece offers a compassionate alternative to the traditional veterinary office. With her warm demeanor and gentle approach, she provides at-home euthanasia services that allow pets to pass peacefully in the comfort and familiarity of their own homes. By removing the stress and clinical atmosphere often associated with end-of-life care, Dr. Treece ensures pets and their families experience this tender moment surrounded by love, calm, and dignity.

## **Knoxville’s Gentle Advocate for At-Home Pet Farewells**

Dr. Treece understands that the emotional toll of euthanasia can be overwhelming for pet parents. Her approach prioritizes creating a serene environment where pets can relax, and families can grieve without pressure or time constraints. She recognizes that each family’s needs are unique and takes the time to walk alongside them, providing clear explanations and unwavering support throughout the process. Many families have expressed gratitude for the patience and kindness she extends, helping them feel safe and cared for during an emotionally vulnerable time.

## **From Emergency Vet to End-of-Life Advocate: A Journey Fueled by Compassion**

Raised in Claiborne County and deeply connected to the Knoxville area, Dr. Treece’s veterinary journey began with a focus on emergency medicine, where she spent years providing critical care for sick and injured pets. Working in high-stress emergency clinics, she witnessed firsthand how rushed and clinical many farewells can feel, often leaving families and pets without the gentle closure they deserve. This experience planted the seed for her desire to bring a more compassionate alternative: in-home euthanasia services.

Dr. Treece earned her Veterinary Health Science and Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degrees from Lincoln Memorial University. She then founded Five Rivers Pet Emergency Hospital, where her commitment to saving lives was matched by her empathy for the human-animal bond. This unique combination of emergency medicine expertise and heartfelt understanding positions her perfectly to support families through one of life’s most challenging moments with professionalism and warmth.

## **Families Appreciate Dr. Treece’s Compassion and Patience**

Pet owners consistently share heartfelt gratitude for Dr. Treece’s gentle, understanding approach. One family reflected, “Dr. Treece was so kind and calm, guiding us through every step and making an overwhelming experience feel manageable.” Another said, “Having her come to our home allowed our dog to pass comfortably, surrounded by the people he loved. We never could have asked for a kinder, more compassionate farewell.”

Many reviews highlight how she “took all the time we needed,” never rushing the process and allowing the family to grieve in their own way. Others emphasize her clear communication and emotional support, with one client stating, “She treated our cat as if she were her own, explaining everything and making us feel heard.” Through these compassionate actions, Dr. Treece has become a trusted presence in Knoxville’s pet community during moments of loss.
