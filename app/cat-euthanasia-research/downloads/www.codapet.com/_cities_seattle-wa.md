Dr. Martin was wonderful. Kind, thoughtful, informative, and skilled at the task of painlessly helping my best friend, Sunny the cat, move on to her next life. He also listened patiently. I am really grateful for Dr. Martin's excellent, compassionate care.

(20) reviews

I made a last-minute appointment when my 14-year-old cat 'crashed' due to cancer. He had been doing well, but in the space of a day just suddenly went downhill and was obviously in his last hours. My vet had recommended a couple in home pet euthanasia services, since my cat is very fearful of strangers and taking him to a vet or hospital would have been extremely traumatic. I contacted Codapet and was able to schedule Dr. Bonnie Goldthwaite for the same day. Dr. Goldthwaite called ahead to review the process, listened to all my concerns, and helped work out a plan to mitigate the stranger-fear. She was prompt, knowledgeable, and kind at a terrible time. She explained the process before we started, and kept me informed through every step. The icing on the cake was the sweet wicker basket and homemade blankets she wrapped my sweetheart in to take him away. I will definitely recommend this service, and Dr. Goldthwaite, to anyone who finds themselves in this situation. It's awful to go through, and having a goodhearted guide makes a huge difference.

Dr. Norman was the perfect doctor to help our family on one of the toughest days we encountered. She was prompt and on time. She was understanding and took her time explaining every step of the way. She ensured our pup was comfortable and never in pain. From the beginning to the end where we received our pups ashes back, Dr. Norman remained a professional. For being en extreme tough day for our family, Dr.Norman handled everything perfectly. Highly recommend.

## Pet euthanasia and cremation pricing in Seattle, WA

### Reservations and payments

Your credit card is required to reserve your appointment. However, no payment is required until the appointment and nothing is due until the appointment is completed

### Cancellation policy or pet passing

We charge cancellation fee of $100 if an appointment is cancelled less than 4 hours before the start time. If your pet passes away before your appointment you would not be charged a cancellation fee. If the vet you scheduled is able, and you would like their assistance with cremation, then pickup fee would apply instead of euthanasia fee

[Personalize Quote](/schedule-appointment "Personalize Quote")

## Other Consideration

### Large Animals

If you have a larger pet, your vet may need the help of one friend or family member. Talk to your vet about options and limitations when they reach out to you prior to your appointment, and they will inform you of any extra cost for your situation. 

### How do I get my pet’s ashes

Options for your pets return home and memorabilia depend on your local provider. Your vet coordinate the return of your pet’s ashes and let you know if there are additional fees for urn delivery. 

### Special factors affecting price

Extra time or medications needed can affect the total price. Other factors can be if it is decided that it’s not time to euthanize your pet after the vet has arrive. In that case, only the travel fee, platform fee, and a quality of life consult would apply. 

## FAQs

### What’s included in the total cost?

The total cost includes the in-home pet euthanasia service fee, any travel fee (if any apply), and a platform fee. Additionally, depending on your choice, fees may apply for cremation services or keepsakes.

### Will the vet take my pet with them after the appointment?

During your appointment, your vet will confirm your aftercare selection with you. If you choose to arrange cremation services, your vet will oversee your pet’s transportation to a local facility for cremation. If your preferred cremation option includes the return of your pet’s ashes to you, your vet will discuss the process to reunite you with your pet's ashes and the anticipated time frame during your appointment

### Will the vet examine my pet once they get to my home?

Yes, upon arrival the veterinarian will assess your pet. This can look different than an “nose to tail” examination in a clinic setting and will focus more on the pet’s history and quality of life.

### What if I am not sure it is time?

It is not uncommon to have doubts about whether the time is right. If you’ve taken the Quality of Life Questionnaire and are still unsure, we recommend consulting with your family veterinarian before scheduling an appointment.  
  
Rest assured, if you book an appointment, your in-home euthanasia veterinarian will let you know if they do not believe that euthanasia is appropriate at this time.

### How long will the procedure take?

You can expect your veterinarian to be in your home from 20-60 minutes, depending on how much of that time you need or want throughout the process.

### How does at-home pet euthanasia work?

At-home pet euthanasia with CodaPet’s network of veterinarians provides loving, end-of-life care when you need it most. Once you schedule a visit online, you will receive a confirmation, and your vet will make sure everything is arranged with care and clarity.

When your vet arrives, they’ll begin with a gentle assessment to reassure you of your decision and answer any questions you may have. Your vet will always move at your pace, giving you the time and space you need to say goodbye in your own way.

When you are ready, your vet will gently administer a sedative so your pet can relax and drift into a deep, peaceful sleep. After the sedation has fully taken effect, a final, humane medication is given, allowing for a calm and painless passing surrounded by love.

If you choose aftercare, your vet will respectfully care for your pet and transport them for cremation, handling every step with dignity and compassion.

### How much does at-home pet euthanasia cost in my area?

At-home euthanasia with CodaPet’s network of veterinarians in Seattle and the surrounding areas begins at around $355. Your final cost may vary based on your pet’s size, your location, and any additional services you choose—such as private or communal cremation, ashes returned in an urn, or personalized keepsakes.

### How do I tell if my pet is suffering?

**Dr. Lane Martin shares her personal insights on recognizing signs of pain and discomfort in pets:  
  
_"_**_There are many signs that may indicate pain, discomfort, or suffering. These can include a sudden lack or loss of appetite, excessive panting or difficulty breathing, isolation from other pets or family members, exhibiting a hunched stance, or acute lameness/limping."_ \- Dr. Lane Martin  
  
You know your pet better than anyone, but speaking to a veterinarian can help you assess whether euthanasia is the most compassionate option. If you feel you need more help, you can read our guide on ‘[How will I know it’s time](https://www.codapet.com/how-will-i-know-when-its-time)’, take a [quality of life assessment](https://www.codapet.com/quality-of-life-scale), or call customer care at (206) 284-2031.

### How do I know when it’s time to consider euthanasia for my pet?

Every pet is different, and you know yours better than anyone, however, it may be time to consider euthanasia when you notice more ‘bad days than good’. It’s important to keep an eye on your pet’s quality of life and try to understand when it has declined, such as no longer enjoying activities or suffering from unmanageable pain. To help you understand their quality of live, you take a [Quality of Life Assessment](https://www.codapet.com/quality-of-life-scale), which helps your get a more a clear picture of your pet’s well-being at this point in time.

Remember, if you are unsure, speaking with your primary care veterinarian can help better understand your pet’s quality of life. It’s important to speak with your primary care veterinarian if you haven’t yet to understand your pet’s health. If you do not have a primary care veterinarian, consider visiting an urgent care or emergency hospital in your area.  
  
**Dr. Lane Martin shares her personal perspective on assessing a pet’s quality of life:  
  
_"_**_I view a veterinarian's role as helping maintain the quality of life of our patients for as long as possible. When that quality begins to suffer from lack of appetite, energy, poor mobility, or other signs of decreased comfort or cognitive dysfunction; and options for correcting these issues (medications, surgery, other treatments) are no longer working or feasible, then humane euthanasia may be warranted." -_ Dr. Lane Martin**  
  
  
**

### What should I do if my pet is declining fast?

If your pet's health is declining rapidly, it’s crucial to take the following steps:

  * **Consult Your Veterinarian** : Schedule an appointment to discuss your observations and any scoring from a quality-of-life scale. This information can help guide the conversation about your pet's condition and options moving forward. Your vet may suggest palliative care, hospice, or, if necessary, euthanasia.  

  * **Ensure Comfort** : Create a quiet, cozy space with soft bedding and easy access to food, water, and a litter box (if applicable).  

  * **Minimize Stress** : Keep routines simple and familiar, and limit loud noises or disruptions.  

  * **Offer Gentle Care** : Provide soothing touch through gentle petting and offer favorite treats if they can still eat.  

  * **Consider At-Home Euthanasia** : If appropriate, discuss the option of at-home euthanasia with your vet for a peaceful and familiar passing.  

  * **Reach Out for Support** : It's okay to lean on loved ones, pet-loss support groups, or counselors to help navigate this difficult time.



If you're noticing signs of declining health, we encourage you to use our [quality of life scale resource tool](https://www.codapet.com/quality-of-life-scale) to evaluate your pet's condition before your vet visit.

### What is the difference between in home pet euthanasia and euthanasia at a vet clinic?

The key difference is the setting. In home euthanasia allows your pet to pass peacefully in the comfort of their familiar surroundings, reducing stress and anxiety. This option especially benefits pets who may feel scared or uncomfortable traveling to a clinic. It also offers your family a private, intimate experience during this emotional time. While some urgent situations don’t allow for time to schedule in-home euthanasia, many pet owners in Seattle choose in-home services for the peaceful atmosphere and compassionate care their pets receive right where they feel safest. You can [find flexible availability](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment) for our local vets here, or look for [same-day euthanasia](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request) appointments.

### Will my pet experience any pain during euthanasia?

No, pet euthanasia at home is designed to be completely painless. After an initial end-of-life assessment, your veterinarian will first administer a sedative to ensure your pet is relaxed and comfortable. The euthanasia medication then gently stops the heart without causing pain. The process is peaceful and allows your pet to pass without distress.

### Do you provide 24-hour pet euthanasia services?

While we do not offer 24 hour pet euthanasia services, we do provide after-hours and emergency care in Seattle and surrounding cities. You can request [same-day and urgent appointments](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request) to ensure your pet receives the compassionate care they need during critical moments.

### Is there a vet providing in home pet euthanasia services near me?

Yes. Dr. Stephanie Norman, Dr. Lane Martin, and Dr. Bonnie Goldthwaite serve the Greater Seattle area and the Puget Sound I-5 corridor. Their collective service area spans from Snohomish County in the north (including Marysville, Everett, and Lynnwood) down through Seattle and the Eastside (covering Bellevue, Kirkland, and Redmond). They also extend south into Tacoma and South King County communities like Renton and Kent.

You can [use CodaPet.com](https://codapet.com/schedule-appointment) to determine which areas our local vets serve, view pricing, and see her availability.

If you’d prefer to speak with someone, you can always call (206) 284-2031.

### Is the cost of euthanasia for dogs and cats the same?

Most providers in Seattle charge a flat fee for euthanasia, although some providers do charge based on the size of your pet, so small dogs and cats can be the same price; however, medium or large size dogs (such as Bulldogs, Australian Shepherds, Labradors, or German Shepherds) will likely carry a higher price. At CodaPet, most vets charge a flat fee for both dogs and cats; however, if there is a large pet fee, it will be applied automatically for you to review in the price estimate when you reserve an appointment. You can view the detailed [pricing and availability here](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment) or call us at (206) 284-2031.

### What should I expect during an in home pet euthanasia appointment?

During an in home euthanasia appointment, your veterinarian will make an assessment of your pet’s health and quality of life to provide guidance to ensure your decision is informed. The veterinarian will administer an initial sedative or anesthetic to help your pet relax and become pain-free, ensuring they are comfortable and at ease. In the last stage, your veterinarian will first ensure your pet is fully sedated before gently administering anesthesia which will quickly slow down your pet’s respiratory system until the heart finally stops beating. In most cases, this process takes less than a minute. Your veterinarian will always move at your pace so the process is as comfortable as possible for your pet and your family.

  
**Dr. Martin shares their approach to ensuring a peaceful and compassionate experience:  
  
**_"I like to start by calmly introducing myself to the patient, followed by a brief examination. I make sure to answer any questions the client(s) might have regarding their pet's condition. I then walk the family through the entire euthanasia process and make sure everyone present understands what will happen during my visit." -_ Dr. Lane Martin

### Can I choose a specific veterinarian for my pet’s euthanasia?

Yes, you can always choose the veterinarian you prefer, at the times they have available to reserve. You can see their [real-time availability](https://www.codapet.com/schedule-appointment) or request a [same-day urgent appointment](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request) if no time suits your needs.

**Note** : This consultation is aimed at providing advice on end-of-life care and quality-of-life questions. Your veterinarian is not offering telemedicine and is not able to provide specific diagnosis or treatments. If you have any medical needs, please visit your primary care veterinarian.

  


### How far in advance do I need to make an appointment?

The notice for every veterinarian differs, however, most veterinarians require at least a 2-hour notice from the time you need them to arrive at your home. This allows them time to prepare and ensure they can provide the highest level of care and compassion for your pet. It also accounts for their travel time, as your veterinarian may be traveling from many different locations around Seattle.

  
While you can request a [same-day and emergency services](https://www.codapet.com/urgent-request), it's always best to contact us as early as possible to ensure availability and to give both you and your veterinarian time to prepare for this important moment.

### What should I expect in terms of my pet’s behavior during the pet euthanasia process?

During the euthanasia process, your pet will be gently guided to a state of peace and comfort. After a sedative is administered, you can expect them to become calm and relaxed, free from any pain or distress. When the final injection is given, your pet will slowly drift off into a deep sleep before passing away peacefully. Your compassionate veterinarian will ensure the process is as gentle and serene as possible, allowing you to be present with your beloved companion in their final moments of love and care.

### Can I be with my pet during the euthanasia process?

Yes, during the pet euthanasia process, you are encouraged to be with your pet throughout the entire process. Being there provides comfort and reassurance to your pet as they pass peacefully.

### How should I prepare my home for my pet’s euthanasia?

Everyone’s experience in saying goodbye to their beloved companion is different and very personal. It’s important to consider that you know your pet best. Some considerations, however, are choosing a comfortable space where your pet feels safe, sometimes their favorite spot in your home. Another consideration can be to gather any family members who wish to be present, and feel free to bring your pet’s favorite blanket or toys, etc that make them feel comfortable. When your veterinarian arrives they will guide you through each step in the process and help you move at your pace to ensure the process is as peaceful as possible.

### How long does the euthanasia procedure typically take?

In home euthanasia procedures usually take about 10-15 minutes, however, the total time can vary depending on the pace you and your family prefer to move at and your pet’s comfort level. Most appointments typically last anywhere from 30-60 minutes. Your veterinarian will take the time necessary to ensure you feel you have enough time to be with your beloved pet while also ensuring your pet is calm and relaxed before proceeding. In some cases, this may take longer, especially if your pet is anxious or uncomfortable.

We understand that saying goodbye is a deeply emotional experience, and we encourage families to take as much time as they need during the process. Our goal is to create a peaceful and compassionate environment for both you and your pet.

### What should I do after the euthanasia procedure is completed?

After the euthanasia, you are welcome to spend as much time as you need with your pet to say goodbye. If you’ve chosen any cremation services to handle your pet’s body, your veterinarian will reconfirm your choices and gently transport your pet when you are ready. If you’ve chosen any keepsakes offered by the crematorium, like Claw Paw Prints, Ink nose prints, or other memorabilia, your veterinarian will reconfirm your choices before leaving your home. If you have any questions or want to change your mind about any of your choices, you can discuss your options with your veterinarian before they leave your home.

### What are my options for cremation?

After the in home euthanasia procedure, your veterinarian will provide you with time to say goodbye to your pet. Once you're ready, they will re-confirm your preferred aftercare option that you choose when reserving your time with your veterinarian. In seattle, you can select two types of cremation services:

  * **Individual Cremation (Ashes Returned)** : An individual cremation is a process where your pet will be cremated separated with physical barriers in the chamber. This ensures the separation with other pets in the chamber so you may reunite with your pet’s ashes. Your pet’s ashes will be returned to you in an urn of your choice. If you choose an additional urn then your pet’s ashes will be returned in the urn of your choice.  

  * **Communal Cremation (No Ashes Returned)** : A communal cremation is a process where your pet is cremated in a chamber with other pets. Once the process is complete, the crematorium will respectfully scatter your pet’s remains among other pets. It’s important to note, you pet’s ashes will not be returned to you.



If you choose to leave your pet's body with your veterinarian, rest assured it will be handled with the utmost care, respect, and dignity. Your veterinarian will coordinate all aftercare arrangements as requested, allowing you to focus on yourself and your family after this difficult goodbye.

### What types of memorials or keepsakes can I get for my pet?

Our local vets offer a variety of memorial keepsakes to help honor your pet’s memory. Options include paw prints, personalized urns, and custom photo frames, allowing you to create a lasting tribute to your beloved pet. Our veterinarians have a list of keepsake options you can choose from, including:

  
**Dr. Lane Martin**

  * Clay Paw Print
  * Ink Paw Print
  * Fur Clipping



**Dr. Bonnie Goldthwaite**

  * Name Engraving for Plaque on Wood Urns



**Dr. Stephanie Norman**

  * Ink Print

### How do I get my pet’s ashes back?

Your veterinarian will coordinate the return of your pet’s ashes before they leave your home. Your options include having your pet’s remains delivered by your veterinarian (for an additional fee), shipping them to you (for an additional fee), or picking them up from your primary clinic or the crematorium.

### Are there any low-cost or no-cost pet euthanasia solutions?

Saying goodbye to a beloved pet is never easy, and we understand that cost can be a concern for many pet parents. While we offer premium in-home euthanasia services, we also want to ensure that you have access to affordable options in Seattle if you're on a budget.

Below are some low-cost euthanasia options available in Seattle and nearby areas:

  
**The Humane Society for Tacoma & Pierce County**  
2608 Center Street Tacoma, WA 98409

**Everett Animal Shelter**  
333 Smith Island Road, Everett, WA 98201  
(425) 257-6000

**Note** : When considering a low-cost pet euthanasia option, it's important to call ahead to check availability, as some providers may require an appointment or have eligibility criteria, such as income-based assistance. Be sure to ask about additional costs, including cremation or aftercare services, which may not be included in the base price. Additionally, verify service details, as some options may have restrictions based on your pet’s size, health condition, or location.  


While low-cost options are available, many pet parents choose in-home euthanasia to ensure a peaceful, stress-free farewell in the comfort of their home. If you're looking for a private, compassionate experience, we’re here to help.

> After making the difficult decision to help our elderly bulldog cross the rainbow bridge, we found CodaPet online, offering in-home euthanasia. Our dog was a large breed and could hardly walk, and I couldn’t bear the thought of transporting her to a cold clinic for her final moments with us. Dr. Michelli arrived at our home and was so kind and gentle with our sweet girl; she explained to us how things would work and gave us time to answer any questions. We were so thankful to be able to say our final goodbyes to our fur baby in the privacy of our home and with her in the comfort of her own bed. Our hearts are broken by the loss, but I couldn’t have wished for a better way to have gone about this experience. Thank you, Dr. M and CodaPet. 🙏🏻🌈

Explaining everything along the way. He even noticed all our family photos that included her acknowledging how loved she was and that he could tell she had an amazing life. Very personable and kind.

> We had a sudden need for home pet euthanasia for our beloved little dog, Jellybean. None of our local vets offered the service timely, so we had to try an unknown. I found CodaPet online and there were appointments available. Dr. Gordon at CodaPet was wonderful. The whole process went smoothly. Communication was thorough. She was a little late, but kept us updated (because you can't rush these things). She said all the right things and comforted us in our decision. We are heartbroken, but at least this part will be a good memory. Our pup was at home, peaceful, and not stressed out by being at the vet. We pet him, cried, told stories, and he just fell asleep. People who provide this service are special people. We SO appreciated being home for his final day. We would not hesitate to recommend Dr. Gordon if you unfortunately need this service.

If and when the time comes to make that hurtful decision, Dr. Mays and the Coda company are the best to consider. Thanks once again for helping my family & me ease through this transition. Phd

Our beloved dog was treated with the utmost dignity and respect. We are extremely grateful that she was willing to come as early as possible on a weekend. I would highly recommend this service for anyone facing this difficult decision.

> Dr. Orth was wonderful! She responded very quickly, which seemed like a miracle for us. She was very thorough and kind with our distressed older cat. She quickly assessed our cat Ronnie and agreed it was time. She explained what she would do and what would happen. She was very gentle and kind with our pet. She arrived totally prepared and acted to calm Ronnie and make the visit as comforting as possible. We can’t say enough good things about her professionalism and kindness to our pet and my husband and me. It’s very clear she loves animals. We would highly recommend her to help your cat in Sanger, CA area.

> Dr. Clark could not have been a more kind, compassionate and patient veterinarian. He’s also very experienced and made what I expected to be a traumatic experience (in home pet euthanasia) as peaceful as it could be and I will be forever grateful for that. I felt awful that I waited a day or two too long before making the decision, but having Dr. Clark be the one to help us was the right choice. We’ll now be taking our other dog to his practice for care.

> Losing a fur baby is devastating. Dr. Laurie Noe aided us through the difficult and emotional pain of saying goodbye. She was kind, patient, compassionate, answered our questions and treated our Hank with love and respect. This was our first time using in-home euthanasia and will do so with our remaining pets. It was a personal & loving way to say goodbye.

> We are so grateful to Dr. Sarah Clem for the calm, loving presence she brought into our home during such a difficult time. From the moment she arrived, we felt respected—not only in our home, but throughout the entire process. I didn’t even realize in-home euthanasia was an option, and I can honestly say the experience was as peaceful and comforting as it could possibly be. Her compassion made an unbearable moment feel gentle and dignified. We will always be thankful.

> Dr. Martin was kind and caring during the last moments of Caden's life as our fur baby. He was patient and explained every process in compassionate detail. We also thought that him bringing the ashes back directly to us which allowed him to check in on us was extremely thoughtful. I would recommend his services to anyone during that difficult time of their lives.

> This was the second time we used Dr. Martin's services. Our dog Bryn was experiencing significant neuro issues. We decided that evening we needed to put an end to any further suffering. We contacted Dr. Martin early the next morning and he was able to come over soon after. He is wonderful at helping you through this extremely difficult process with compassion and care for both you and your pet. He understands the difficulty in this being the last moments with your pet and gives you the time to grieve the loss. I highly recommend Dr. Martin.

> Using CodaPet was so easy; from searching for a vet near me to clear pricing. Once booked they remained in constant communication with me throughout the process, providing time updates, etc. Our family was matched with Dr.Kelsey Jones and I can not recommend her enough. She arrived promptly, listened to our concerns, examined our furbaby Ciddy and gave us ample time to grieve and make the final decision. At no moment did I feel pressured to rush. She gave us time to set up an area outside and spoke to us like a friend throughout the process, while treating all of us with respect and compassion. She even made a suggestion on how to allow our other dog to say goodbye (which I would never have thought of). It’s not an easy choice to let go of a beloved pet but i feel this was the best way to do it and highly recommend her services.

> Amazing. I went online in the morning at 6am and scheduled for 11am. They even have a link for more urgent response. Dr. Alex was incredibly compassionate and professional. I had never heard of this service before and my friend recommended it. Hands down this is the only way i will ever do this again. The gratitude i have for Dr. Alex and her service cannot be understated. I was very moved by the experience. My kitty had zero stress; i placed her on my lap while i sat on the bed. Dr. Alex was so gentle and kind. I cannot praise enough. Thank you so much.

> Our cat had reached the untreatable senior age of 18, and it meant a lot to say goodbye from the comfort of his home instead of taking him to the vet, where his last experience would've been stressful and upsetting for him. Interacting with Dr. Jessica was exactly what I was looking for during such a tough experience. Prompt, respectful, professional, and gentle. We thank her and CodaPet for their service.

Not only could the closest people to him be close to him in the comfort of his home, but his other fur friends could be there with him as well so they could understand why he left. It was a very peaceful passing and I couldn't thank Dr. Martin enough for his kind and passionate care for my beloved Bennie.
