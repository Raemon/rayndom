For over two decades, Dr. Kim Bagnoni has dedicated her life to caring for pets and supporting the families who love them in Augusta, GA, and the surrounding areas. A seasoned veterinarian with a deep understanding of the human-animal bond, Dr. Bagnoni provides compassionate, expert care for dogs and cats, including specialized in-home pet euthanasia services through her partnership with CodaPet. Beyond her veterinary work, she also shares her passion and leadership by coaching a local high school sailing team — a role that reflects her commitment to mentoring and community support.

## A Trusted Veterinarian with Heart and Experience

Dr. Bagnoni’s journey in veterinary medicine began with her education at the University of Florida and continued through Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine, where she graduated in 2001. Over the past 20+ years, she has served families throughout the Augusta area with compassion and professionalism, helping pets live healthier, happier lives.

Her personal experience with the loss of beloved pets has fueled her passion for guiding families through the difficult end-of-life decisions. Recognizing the need for a more peaceful, comforting option, Dr. Bagnoni partnered with CodaPet to offer at-home euthanasia services — allowing pets to pass surrounded by familiar sights, smells, and their loved ones.

Certified as a Peaceful Euthanasia Veterinarian (CPEV) by the California Association of End-of-Life Veterinarians, Dr. Bagnoni combines her medical knowledge with empathy to provide dignified, gentle care during this tender transition. She serves all dogs and cats in Evans, Augusta, Grovetown, Harlem, Appling, and nearby communities.

## Supporting Families on and off the Water: Sailing Coach

Outside the veterinary clinic, Dr. Bagnoni channels her leadership and dedication into coaching a local high school sailing team alongside her husband. This role allows her to mentor young athletes, teaching not only the skills of sailing but also perseverance, teamwork, and sportsmanship.

Her coaching reflects many of the qualities she brings to her veterinary practice — patience, attentiveness, and genuine care. This balance between professional expertise and community involvement enriches her connection to Augusta and strengthens her ability to support families through all stages of life.

## Comprehensive Services for Pets and Families

Dr. Bagnoni offers a full suite of services tailored to meet the needs of pets and their families during some of life’s most emotional moments, including:

  * **At-Home Pet Euthanasia** : Providing a peaceful, compassionate passing in the comfort of home, starting at $300.
  * **Pet Cremation Services** : Arranging careful, respectful transportation and cremation options, starting at $90.
  * **Keepsakes** : Personalized clay paw prints and wooden urns to honor your pet’s memory.
  * **Quality of Life Consultations** : Virtual or in-home sessions to help assess your pet’s wellbeing, starting at $200.



Dr. Bagnoni requests a minimum two-hour notice and is committed to accommodating families’ needs whenever possible.

## A Personal Commitment to Compassionate Care

As a mother of three and a longtime Augusta resident, Dr. Bagnoni knows firsthand the profound love between pets and their families. Her resilient cat D.W., a former abandoned kitten who made a full recovery under her care, serves as a daily reminder of the strength and spirit shared by all animals.

Dr. Bagnoni’s mission is to offer comfort, dignity, and support to families in their most difficult times, combining veterinary excellence with heartfelt empathy. Whether helping a pet cross the rainbow bridge or coaching the next generation of sailors, she embodies dedication and compassion in every aspect of her life.
