## What pet parents are saying

> I cannot thank Dr Lane Martin enough for his patience and guidance regarding my beloved dog on her final day and in getting her ashes back. You need reassurance that you are doing what is best for your pet. My dog was the best and I loved her as my child. Understanding grief and information I received from coda pet as well helped me stand up for my needs with my sister and her spouse. Dr Martin is dedicated to helping you and your pet through this process. People used to ask me how I could work as a hospice nurse but I was gifted in helping people across the widest ranges of situations. He has that gift for pets and their owners and this is his practice. Thank you

> Rambo, our precious gentle giant, was losing his battle with bone cancer. Hevwas very affraid of going to the vet, and we didnt want him going through any more stress, so Dr Martin came to our home so that our Rambo could pass peaceful, surrounded by loved ones. He was very compassionate and gentle with him, and he walked us through everything, so that we knew what to expect.

> From the moment he came to our door, his calm compassionate nature shined through. His patience and tenderness put our normally excitable dogs at ease. He accessed Sasha and agreed that his quality of life would only get worse over time. His difficulty breathing would eventually affect his movement and balance. George held Sasha on his lap, Dr. Lane kneeled beside him and administered the medications. He went peacefully. Doctor Lane gave us time to say our goodbyes and answered all our last minute questions. It made a difficult decision a truly memorable one. Thank you.

He treated our pet with such gentleness and dignity, and guided us through the euthanasia procedure with genuine care and understanding. In an incredibly emotional time for our family, his kindness, patience, and empathy brought us great comfort. We truly appreciate the respect he showed both to our dog and to us, and we are thankful for the exceptional care he provided during one of the hardest moments we’ve faced.

> Losing my Yorkie baby Tank on October 23rd was the hardest thing I ever experienced. Tank was the sweetest dog we had for more than 14 years and he joined our family when he was only 8 weeks. It was a very difficult decision to schedule the appointment with Dr. Martin, and even harder to make the call at the last moment. Dr. Martin was very professional. He was patient and compassionate; explained everything in details and comforted us that we were making the right decision. Tank end up passing on his own. While Dr. Martin was examining him before the injection, Tank knew it was time for him to go. I really appreciate Dr. Martin to be there with us during this difficult time and he even personally delivered Tank (in a wooden urn) back to us one week later. Thank you so much, Dr. Martin for doing this hard job. You are helping so many pet parents...you are such a blessing to us. We also received the hand written card from him which brought us comfort. Thank you, Doctor!

> Our cat went downhill really fast from kidney failure and we wanted to help him pass away peacefully at home. We were able to get a same-day appointment with Dr. Lane Martin, scheduled online. Dr. Martin communicated with us via text so we'd know when he was arriving (he got stuck in traffic, but let us know so we had a few extra minutes with our sweet cat). At our home, Dr. Martin was compassionate and respectful, explaining the process and giving us plenty of time to say goodbye to our cat. He administered a sedative first, and we were able to hold and pet our cat as he peacefully passed away. Dr. Martin then stepped out of the room so we could take the time we needed to say goodbye. Losing a beloved pet is so hard, but I'm extremely grateful that our cat was able to pass peacefully at home. Thank you, Dr. Martin.

> I can’t speak highly enough of Dr. Martin. He was available at the exact time we needed someone to come and he showed so much care for my beloved cat Winter and our family. He was willing to work in a cramped space on the balcony so that we could enjoy the fresh air in Winter’s last moments of life. Her death was so peaceful and she showed no fear or discomfort at all. I’m so glad this service was available and that Dr. Martin could help our family. It’s difficult to put a beloved pet to sleep but when the time comes, it’s so much better to be able to do it at home on your own terms.

We contacted Dr. Martin early the next morning and he was able to come over soon after. He is wonderful at helping you through this extremely difficult process with compassion and care for both you and your pet. He understands the difficulty in this being the last moments with your pet and gives you the time to grieve the loss. I highly recommend Dr. Martin.

> I can't imagine having to bring our cat in a pet carrier to the vet to put her down. Being able to use an in home euthanasia service was very important to keeping our cat calm and feeling loved. Dr. Martin arrived just at the time we expected, explained everything clearly and our dear cat, Idgie, left this world peacefully. It's horrible to have to put your pet down, but I couldn't imagine anyone being more understanding than Dr. Martin. Additionally, Dr. Martin checked in with me the next day and gave me some grief resources.

> We made a very difficult decision to euthanize our sweet Shorthair Havanese dog. She was 13 years old and we had her since 7 weeks old. We decided that in home euthanasia would be the best option for our family and for Snickers. Dr. Martin brought his calm and caring presence at our agreed time. He greeted us and our Snickers with compassion and consideration for the difficult decision we made. He made us all comfortable with the decision we made and understood that Snickers was ready for that cross over to the Rainbow Bridge. We didn't feel rushed and was able to spend the last moments with her. We have another dog who is 15.5 years old and when his time comes, we hope to make a similar choice when the time is right.

> August 17th was a really hard day. It was Sunday, and my boy Gus had been to the vet that Friday because he was acting just a little off. By Saturday at 1:00 we got the news - late stage advanced renal failure, so in order to feel productive and push aside my emotions for the time being, I scheduled an in home euthanasia for Monday afternoon. I stayed up with him all night, and by 6:00am I knew that trying to hold on until Monday afternoon was no longer the right choice. His condition advanced so rapidly that the thought of moving him and taking him somewhere just felt out of the question - I wasn't sure he could even survive being transported, and for a boy that loved his Vet office so much, I could not bear moving him and taking him some place unfamiliar. After hours of calls, emails, inquiries, Dr. Martin swooped in - he actually doesn't live far from us, and he was able to come around 11:30am. By 12:00pm my boy was gone. It was devastating, it was kind, it was everything that my boy deserved. And, when his remains were ready to come home, Dr. Martin delivered to us so we did not have to go pick him up. It was a gut wrenching, but incredible experience, and has inspired me to look into training to be a Certified Animal Hospice Practitioner so that I can help other families through their experience. I will be forever grateful.

He hated the vet. The only thing he hated more than the vet, was the vet’s clinic. I’m so grateful we didn’t have to take him there. He was able to take his last breath in his own bed surrounded by the people who loved him. Thank you to Dr. Martin for witnessing our grief and guiding us through our last goodbye.

> Dr. Martin was a calm, supportive presence during this difficult transition. He was respectful of the experience from the moment he gently knocked on our door, throughout the process and up until he quietly let himself out once his role was complete. We are so grateful to have had him to provide a most peaceful and loving farewell to our beloved pup. I would recommend him and his services to anyone in a heartbeat.

> Dr. Martin made a hard decision feel like we were doing the right thing for our 13 year old dog who was losing mobility. Coming to our home where it was peaceful and comfortable, as well as Dr. Martin's kind presence, helped tremendously with the grief of the situation. The aftercare options were also thoughtful. Having this service available is truly a gift.

> Dr. Martin was very professional and helpful during the time of putting JJ down. After JJ had joined Jake & Hobo on the other side Lane offered to help carry JJ to the back yard which meant a lot to me because trying to carry a 110lb German Shepard when he has gone is no easy feat. Thanks Lane for being so understanding and thoughtful during this time. Oren

When it was over, he took great care in letting us let go without any sense of hurry. When he left with Gizmo we knew he was in good hands. He took the time to reassure us of the rightness of our decision once again. Will be forever grateful.

> It has taken us a minute to write this only because we have been missing our little Bella Princess so much. In what is and can be a very challenging and difficult decision, Dr. Lane was the ABSOLUTE BEST and most compassionate vet. He is sincerely caring and took the time to listen to our story. He was very good at explaining the process, how it worked and what we should expect. He was so patient. Because of his professionalism, it was a peaceful and painless experience for all of us! If you have to make this difficult decision for your animal, I couldn’t recommend Dr. Lane anymore for being the one who helps you through this challenging time.

Dr. Martin was able to come quickly, and was such a comfort in helping us with the decision and the procedure. Having had some experience prior, we knew what to expect.

> Dr. Lane Martin provided compassionate care during this end of life process for our beloved Kiya. While it’s never an easy decision to make, it was the right decision to have her at home in her comfortable place with those she loves. Dr. Martin was reassuring - asking all the right questions - affirming it was her time to go. The procedure was explained and went smoothly. She was able to pass peacefully in our arms receiving all the love she deserved. Thank you Dr. Lane Martin. Coda Pet has a very easy & efficient process to schedule and pay for this service. Linda S.

> I'm grateful for CodaPet, and specifically Dr. Lane Martin. He was kind and very respectful, and made a sad situation better.💜He spoke softly to my cat, Sunny, and told her what a good girl she is. He asked relevant questions, gave me plenty of information, and listened well. His empathy & caring were evident. Dr. Martin even respectfully listened to me share how I'd used an animal communicator to find out my cat wanted to cross over. All in all, it was a beautiful experience.🌈

> Our sweet loving corgi had medical problems we couldn’t correct. Dr Martin arrived at our home, kind, spoke to us. We knew we had no options but to have our Kobe put out of misery. Dr Martin was patient, soft spoken, empathy and thoughtful. My husband and I had him put to sleep Mac at 14 with DM, Alfie at 13 with seizures at clinic. This service of coming to our home was perfect for us as seniors. Appreciate the support during difficult time.

> Kudos to Dr. Martin Of CodaPet. When he arrived at our home, we all , my cat "Ollie" wrapped a blanket, sat on the porch. He did not rush but talked with us until both cat and I were calm. A sedative made for a sleepy cat, so the euthanasia that followed did not cause him discomfort. I hated to let go, but this was a kindness to a terminally ill cat.
