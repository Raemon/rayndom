Overview

About Me

## Why I provide at-home pet euthanasia

As a veterinarian, my journey with end-of-life care has been shaped by deeply personal experiences with both animals and humans. I have seen firsthand how difficult it can be to say goodbye, and I felt a profound calling to make this process as peaceful and compassionate as possible for pets and their families. Having worked with animals ranging from tiny reptiles to majestic elephants, I understand that every creature, regardless of size or species, deserves dignity, respect, and love—especially at the end of their life. By providing in-home pet euthanasia, I offer families the comfort of saying goodbye in a familiar, stress-free environment, surrounded by love and warmth. My passion for holistic care extends beyond just the physical well-being of animals. I believe in supporting both pets and their families through this challenging time by offering compassionate hospice care, guidance, and the space for meaningful moments in the comfort of home. At its core, my mission is simple: to provide a peaceful passing for pets and help their families navigate this emotional journey with the utmost care and empathy. Every pet deserves a peaceful goodbye, and every family deserves to feel supported throughout this process.

> Dr. Sims was nothing short of amazing on the day we unfortunately had to put our girl Nala to sleep for her last rest. Dr. Sims came in, very sweetly spoken woman explaining everything to us through the whole process. She was comforting, very well educated in her field and we couldn't have asked for a better doctor. If we had any questions she answered them perfectly and made us all feel at ease in what was easily the hardest day of our lives. Nala was very VERY loved and Dr. Sims could see that, she took perfect care of us and our dear Nala better than we could have ever expected. I would recommend her to anybody who has to make this difficult decision.

> Dr. Sims was very compassionate and empathetic when taking care of our 18 old family dog. She never rushed the process and explained everything thoroughly. She validated us and let us know we were making the right choice. The options for final resting place were great and honestly felt as compassionate as going through this with an immediate family member. I’ve already recommended her to many people. Thank you again for taking care of Yogi.

> Dr Sims helped us through the very difficult end of life process for our beloved dog. She answered all of our questions and let us experience it the way we wanted to. She was very caring and compassionate and made the process so much better for us than taking our dog out of the house. I can't recommend Dr. Sims highly enough.

> We couldn’t have asked for a better provider to help our precious Lola finally find peace. It was incredibly difficult to find someone willing to come to the house, and we were so grateful that Dr. Sims was able to accommodate us. She was the gentle, steady presence we needed to guide us through what was, honestly, one of the hardest decisions of my life. It takes an extraordinarily gifted person to be a veterinarian who performs in-home euthanasia—someone who can hold space for such emotional gravity while still offering unwavering kindness, compassion, and professional expertise. Dr. Sims may have done this for a thousand other families, but she made us feel like Lola was the only pet in the world—not just another appointment. She honored the depth of our grief and treated our family with such tenderness and respect. All five of us, including our young children, were able to be there as the dog who had been with us from the very beginning slipped away peacefully and without pain. Losing Lola was incredibly hard, but Dr. Sims gave us the profound gift of letting her go with dignity, love, and calm. For that, we will be forever grateful. Thank You Dr. Sims

> We could not have asked for a warmer or more respectful vet to help us during this awful time. We were given the time and space to say goodbye to our 16 year old cat in the comfort of his home and on his favorite blanket. I am so glad we found Dr. Sims and she was able to help our cat go peacefully. Thank you Dr. Sims.
