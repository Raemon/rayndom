## For Referring Veterinarians

We appreciate your referrals for complimentary therapies like acupuncture, spinal manipulation (chiropractic care), cold laser therapy, massage, food therapy and herbal medication. Referring Veterinarians can expect a professional, integrative working relationship.

### What Referring Veterinarians Can Expect

  * An integrative approach to medicine that truly defines “holistic” care. 
  * Referral back to your clinic for any recommended diagnostics such as radiographs, blood work, urinalysis, etc
  * Timely and accurate medical records for each patient and treatment
  * Referral back to your clinic for any refills of prescription medication or supplements the patient was prescribed by you
  * We strongly believe in routine, conventional medical care, yearly wellness bloodwork, heartworm testing, appropriate vaccines, and preventatives. We do not administer vaccines, perform heartworm testing, prescribe preventatives, etc. Therefore we will always refer your patients back to you for regular wellness care and preventatives. 
  * Referral back to your clinic for any cross-over therapies we may offer. For example, if you refer for acupuncture but are currently treating the pet with laser therapy, we will refer the client back to your facility for those treatments. 
  * Here to answer any questions or concerns you may have about treatment plans, etc
  * A referral letter with medical records from our veterinarian.

### Qualification & Experience you can trust

We know as a veterinarian you care about your patients, clients and your reputation. As a referring veterinarian, you want someone you can trust, not just a person who took a weekend course in massage or just know a few acupuncture points. Dr. Nichollette Rider has the experience, training and credentials you can trust.
