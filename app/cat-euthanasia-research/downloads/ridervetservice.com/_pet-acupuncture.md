# Pet Acupuncture

[ __ Contact Us ](https://ridervetservice.com/contact-us/)

Pet acupuncture can be used to treat or manage a number of medical issues. It is well tolerated by most pets. Acupuncture is not just limited to older pets or painful conditions. Pets of all ages can benefit from natural treatment like acupuncture. 

Acupuncture is the insertion of needles into specific points of the body, usually along Meridians, to produce healing effects. Veterinary Acupuncture has been used in China for thousands of years, making it one of the oldest medical modalities for treating animals. Today, however, it is used all over the world to treat many different ailments. As we understand more about the neurological system and how acupuncture affects endorphins, pain, endocrine and immune systems, neurologists and anesthesiologists are at the forefront of adopting these ancient modalities for use in modern times. 

Integrative veterinary medicine uses adjunctive therapies, like acupuncture, in addition to Western Medicine. Acupuncture cannot treat all ailments, but can be very successful when used where indicated. It is mostly non-invasive and has miniscule side effects, making it an excellent option for treating all pets, including those that are compromised and sick. 

## Pet Acupuncture is useful in treating:

  * Muscle and joint disorders, acute injuries
  * Pain (arthritis, cancer, athletic injury, post operative)
  * Neurologic and intervertebral disc disease (back/neck issues)
  * Respiratory disorders
  * Anxiety disorders
  * Anorexia/decreased appetite
  * GI disease (diarrhea, vomiting, gas)
  * Skin disease
  * Seizures

###  How to prepare your pet for an Acupuncture appointment 

We like to provide treats and little snacks for your pet to keep them happy and comfortable. Please let us know what your pet's favorite treats are so we can have it or something similar on hand. It also helps to have your pet a little hungry so they will take treats more readily from us. Sharing food is a great way for us to become friends. If your pet is on a special diet or you would prefer to supply the treats, please let us know!   
We also like to make sure your pet hasn't eating within at least 30 minutes of the appointment. Full belly's mean the nervous system is focused on digesting and not balancing.   
  
We like your pet to be in a comfortable, quiet area free from distractions. This might be on the couch, floor, blanket, cat tree or pet bed. But we should avoid heavily woven type blankets and fabrics as it can be hard to recover all of the needles.   
  
If you have other pets, it is often helpful to have them occupied in another room or outdoors. The same is true for younger children or other family members that might be a distraction (think others getting a snack... I don't know about you but my fur kids would have to be in a coma to not crowd in the kitchen). If requesting a home visit, please try and schedule appointments when the home is at a low activity level. 

____ WHAT TO EXPECT DURING AN APPOINTMENT

I like to spend the first 10 minutes getting to know your pet. I take this time to get an initial assessment of your pet and your primary concerns. It is also important for me to understand your goals. I will need to know your pet’s current treatment plan, medications, and how you feel they are responding to treatments over time. 

Once I obtain a full history, I will take the time to perform a traditional Chinese veterinary medical exam. This is a little different than a typical Western exam! I’ll ask lots of questions about your pet and examine pulses, tongue color, body temperature and look for sore areas. This helps me understand your pet’s current state and develop an acupuncture treatment plan. 

First, I place a few needles in locations that assist in relaxing your pet. Then, based on the plan and what your pet will tolerate, I will place 5-22 needles. Needle placement usually takes 3-5 minutes. The goal is to keep the needles in for 15-30 minutes. Some needles may fall out and this is normal. Depending on the pet and the medical condition, sometimes 5-7 minutes is long enough to take effect. 

Your pet may also receive some Tui-na (acupuncture massage), laser acupuncture, electroacupuncture or aqua-acupuncture.
