### The Best of Both Worlds - Integrative Holistic Pet Medicine

Our goal is to approach your pet’s care holistically and with balance. At Hello Harmony Vet, Dr. Rider offers an alternative to conventional Western veterinary medicine and pet care. As a result, our integrative and balanced animal health care approach assesses all your pet’s symptoms. We treat the root issues and support long-term health and wellness. This allows us to address issues that are not responding well to conventional treatments and medications. Integrative therapies include acupuncture, spinal manipulation (animal chiropractic care), massage, laser therapy, herbal medication, food therapy, supplements, and more. As part of your pet’s healthcare team, we work with your primary care veterinarian. Therefore, we can accomplish balanced holistic health and wellbeing for your pet.

An integrative approach is highly effective at treating disease and maintaining life-long health by combining the best of both worlds.

### Putting the "Whole" into holistic Pet Care

Modern medicine as we practice and participate in it today focuses on a patient’s symptoms and treating those symptoms, which is an important part of health care. However, it rarely addresses the underlying cause of the disease. As a consequence, recurring health problems may result from not creating and implementing individual treatment plans for each pet’s unique healthcare needs. We believe each patient is an induvial and should be treated as such.

Hello Harmony Vet considers how a deeper understanding and investigation of the underlying cause of your pet’s symptoms are required to effectively treat and manage health issues and promote overall wellness. 

__

### Who We Are

Our goal is to provide balanced holistic and individualized care for your pet. We do this by integrating alternative treatments honed from Traditional Eastern Medicine and more modern manual therapies like rehabilitation and spinal care, into your pet’s treatment plan. We embrace patients as medical individuals and tailor treatment plans using evidence-based therapies and medicine. Harmony Vet by Rider Veterinary Services provides ‘w’ holistic pet care by working with your primary care veterinarian to ensure the best care possible for your pet.

### What We Do....and Don't Do

We use traditional healing methods developed thousands of years ago and are still used today through the validation of scientific study. These trusted and gentle modalities fill the gaps left by conventional Western Medicine. [Acupuncture](https://ridervetservice.com/pet-acupuncture/) can provide pain relief, reduce the need or side effects for pharmaceuticals, use to prolong survival rate in cancer patients, and promote the body’s natural ability to balance and heal. [Manual therapies](https://ridervetservice.com/animal-massage/) like massage and [chiropractic adjustments](https://ridervetservice.com/pet-chiropractic-care/) also relieve pain, promote better joint function and mobility, improve circulation and immunity. Herbal medications potentiate acupuncture and often allow for a lower dose of conventional drugs that frequency care heavy side effects. Food Therapy uses specific whole foods to help your pet heal and promote balance and wellbeing as part of your pet’s individual treatment plan. 

We do not provide certain imaging diagnostics like as x-rays, endoscopy, etc. We do not administer vaccines, perform surgery, heartworm testing or other very important services that are provided by your primary veterinarian. However, these are essential services. They should be administered by your primary vet regularly. Remember, it is the collaboration between adjunctive and conventional Medicine that has been shown to be optimal for overall health. That is what holistic pet care is all about! We actively engage with your primary veterinarian as part of your pet’s balanced, ‘w’ holistic health care team to ensure the best care possible.

### Here until the end: In home Euthanasia

Dr. Rider was wonderful for our at home euthanasia. I am so happy we had her come out. It was very peaceful for our old boy and I would highly recommend her ❤️

Words cannot fully express the gratitude we feel for Dr. Rider and the compassionate care she provided during a truly difficult moment. When it came time, Dr, Rider helped our beloved toy poodle, Stella, pass with grace. Dr. Rider’s tender and patient demeanor brought us comfort and reassurance in what could have been an overwhelming experience.  
Her ability to perform this service in our home gave Stella the peace and dignity she deserved, in a familiar space free from the stress and anxiety that often accompanies a trip to the veterinarian. From the moment Dr. Rider arrived, we knew we had made the right decision. She treated Stella and our entire family with such kindness and respect that it left a lasting impression on all of us.  
Dr. Rider, Sarah and I want to thank you, our family thanks you, and most importantly, Stella thanks you. Your compassion turned a heartbreaking moment into one filled with love and serenity.  
Warmest regards,  
Tyler and Sarah Mitchell

This review is long overdue but much much deserved. I've known Dr. rider for several years and she is the one vet that my dogs actually enjoyed getting in the car and going to visit. I feel lucky to have the same person that cared for them during their healthy days be the same Sweet Soul that help comfortably and compassionately ease them into their last day. Dr. Rider isn't only thinking of the comfort of the pet that is passing, but also the parent that made the hardest decision to know when to say goodbye. She delivers the perfect balance of professionalism with the procedure, but also compassion in giving the owner the time to fully digest the moment. I'll recommend her over and over and over again! And while I'll never be dogless, I'm sure to use her services for the rest of my days. ☺️

This is a review I never wanted to write. Our beloved dog Kennedy went to heaven and Dr. Rider was exceptional in helping her cross. She was so kind and patient as we said our goodbyes, we never felt rushed, we never felt like our girl was stressed or in pain. It was as peaceful as could be and Dr. Rider was so compassionate. Our girl hated the car and going to the vet- we didn’t want her last moments full of anxiety so I am forever grateful for Dr. Rider. Today marks one week since we said goodbye and I was surprised with a card and a paw/nose print in the mail, something she didn’t have to do- but something I will cherish. While I wish I never needed her services, I would absolutely recommend her. Thank you Dr. Rider for not only caring for the pets but for their families too.

I can't recommend Dr. Rider enough. She was very sweet and and explained everything about what she was doing and asked permission before doing anything with my sweet kitty.  
  
thank you, Dr. Rider, for coming out and helping Wilford Brimley cross over and ending his suffering. as much as it hurts, I know it was what was best for him. I appreciate you.

Dr. Rider's care for the well being of your dog (even when hospitalized because of one of her recommendations) only goes as far as your money!  
  
The acupuncture and Chinese herbs did help, however, recommendations for the food didn't make much sense (canola oil, rice?) since these are not found in wolves diets and found to be extremely inflammatory.  
  
I was urged by Dr. Rider to give my dog Proviable. I was hesitant, as I prefer food sourced nutrition (I had fed my dog for years sauerkraut and green tripe). Long story short, I had my dog try Proviable and he had a terrible inflammatory reaction, so much so, that he has been in hospitals for the past week and still is as I write this.  
  
I called Dr. Rider in a panic, asking what can I do to flush this out of his system. Jocelyn, the receptionist, told me I could have a phone consultation in which I would be charged for, and would need to wait a week and a half to happen.  
  
I was offended and explained why: First, my dog has been regularly scheduled for acupuncture appointments. Herbal consultations come free with acupuncture. Second, Ivan is in the hospital BECAUSE of something she recommended! I never would have given him probiotics had she not insisted this is the way to go. Third, my question was "What can I do to flush this from his system and stop this severe inflammatory reaction?" Should be quick to answer. Fourth, he is literally in the hospital- why would we wait a week and a half to discuss???  
  
I made it abundantly clear to Jocelyn I wouldn't pay for a phone consultation and that this offended me so much that I would find a new doctor, as this to me proves my dog's hospitalization only matters to Dr. Rider as far as money will go. Jocelyn insisted she understood and would talk with Dr. Rider- and I left the conversation understanding the call would be free.  
  
In the end, I got a surprise bill for the phone call that I stated from the beginning I wouldn't agree to! And the advice? Feed my dog beef and rice (rice is inflammatory).

I can’t imagine having to load up our sweet girl, who hates car rides, who hates going to the vet, having to have her pass away on a cold table, with limited time because there are other appointments and then to drive home sobbing - this is such a blessing. Dr Rider was incredible, compassionate and I would not have had this any other way. Thank you so much for doing what you do, I cannot imagine it’s easy but we are so grateful.

Dr. Rider is a very special person. The at home euthanasia service she offers is top tier. She explains the process thoroughly before doing anything and makes you feel at ease. I went to shake her hand before she left and she swatted it away and gave me a big hug. I'll never forget that. Thank you Dr. Rider for everything you do and the amazing service you offer.

Dr Rider is kind, compassionate, experienced, loving , caring... I could go on and on. I was an emotional mess and she took the time to support and guide me through the process to help my sweet girl pass on. She soothed my anxieties and I'm forever grateful. My girl had a peaceful passing while in her bed, with her family around, her dog brother playing with a loud squeaky toy the entire time. Dr Rider took one look at my girl and knew everything she needed to know, she is the dog whisperer.Thank you Dr Rider. I appreciate you. Laska in heaven says thank you too.

I could not have asked for a more compassionate and empathetic experience for ANY family member, human or animal.We knew our pet's final moments shouldn't be in a car (which he hated) or in a strange building (which was always stressful). We wanted him put down at home for his sake, and so we could grieve privately.It's hard to write this review without tearing up (even 10 months after the event), and that's why I cannot say enough about this service. So kind, so gentle, so caring. Everything was taken care of with such thoughtfulness - a sign of experience and someone with a calling for what they do.The cost isn't insignificant, but I wouldn't have it any other way.

Our cat got sick rather quickly and we had to let him go. Dr Rider came to our house so we could let him go peacefully, where he was most comfortable. 100% the best decision we could have made! She was able to come the same day, and was very nice, compassionate and caring. Would very highly recommend her!

Dr. Rider is nothing short of amazing. The courage she possesses to do what she does is astounding. She provided so much compassion, sincerity, and kindness to my baby Cooper while he was crossing over. Dr. Rider made the entire experience manageable for us at such a devastating time, especially me. She not only texted with me the night before instructing me on how to keep him comfortable, she came first thing the next morning. She did not have to go out of her way to do that but she did and it meant the world to me. I'll never forget her reassurance that we were making the right decision. She treated Coop like he was her own and I can't thank her enough. I wanted the experience to be painless and peaceful for him and she did just that. I'm crying as I write this because it's so wonderful to know there are such good people in this world. What she does day after day is hard. She is very much appreciated and highly recommend by me.

Thanks to both of you for getting me through the death of my baby girl. Tom

One morning in early October I woke up and I went over to my 15 year old dog, Gypsy. She could not get up. Her back legs wouldn't hold her. I had to help her get up and help her get outside.It was that same day that Gypsy stopped walking altogether. I immediately thought, "Will I need to put her down?" I talked to some friends and two of them told me about Dr. Rider. I live on a farm 40 miles north of the Quad Cities so I had not heard of her. I looked at her website and saw that one of her services was to come to your home to euthanize your pet. I read about hospice which I didn't know existed for animals. I made an appt for Dr. Rider to come out to euthanize my dog of 12 years. I still wasn't sure I wanted to have this appointment as Gypsy wasn't sick, she just couldn't walk. I sent some information to Dr. Rider about Gypsy and then the morning of the appointment, I had a teleconference call with Dr. Rider so that she was also able to see Gypsy. I told her I wasn't comfortable with the decision I had made. She asked me questions to determine the quality of life that Gypsy had. I told her I thought hospice was the way to go at least for right now. She said she would support me in that decision. We had a couple follow-up calls where she gave me several suggestions on how best to care for not only a 15 year old dog but an 85 lb. dog as well. One of many suggestions was to get a harness that led to getting a wheelchair. Today Gypsy has not reverted into a younger dog but she continues to be a faithful companion to me. I am so grateful to my friends who suggested Dr. Rider. She has been extremely helpful. I would highly recommend Dr. Rider and the telehospice service if you live a distance away as I do.

With great uncertainty, I contacted Rider Veterinary Services about my dog Apple. I wasn’t sure if it was “time” to let her go although her multiple prescriptions and inability to walk 20 steps without laying down told me otherwise. I waited until our appointment day, nervous if I was doing right by my 12 year old Bulldog, and then Dr. Rider arrived. The amount of calm that came over me when she assured me that I had done everything possible for my girl and that I was giving her a gift, was immeasurable. Although I was absolutely broken by her death, I will forever be grateful for Dr. Rider and the dignity she gives our pets as they take their last breath. I cannot recommend Rider Veterinary enough. Thank you ever so much.

I don't even know why to start, to have to make this decision is the most heart breaking thing ever. But knowing we could do in in our home was truly a blessing! Dr. Rider was patient, kind and made the process a little more bearable. She was calming and explained everything that would take place. She was very patient and listened to our stories and great love of Bailey. Our Bailey was truly a blessing to us and it was the last act of love we could give her, just shy of 2 months of her 14th birthday. Dr.Rider was was a true angel on our dark day. I highly recommend her for all her services.

I cannot say enough amazing things about Dr Rider and the service she offers. The best way to describe it is she makes one of your worst days bearable. It was comforting to know we would be doing this in our home, where our cat was comfortable, and I would not need to drive afterward. Dr Rider spent time getting to know myself and my cat. She explained what was going to happen and what to expect. She took the time to make sure both of us were comfortable. At no point did I feel rushed to say goodbye. I will always be grateful for Dr Rider and what she does.

Dr. Rider is amazing. Our 11year old English Mastiff crossed over in our own home with us laying right by her side. With Dr. Rider's knowledge and compassion she made the situation stress free for our baby. It was the most peaceful passing any of my animals have ever had and I've always been right by their side. There was no fear in our girl and she was relaxed. Dr. Rider turned the worst situation into a manageable one and gave our family the greatest gift. We are forever grateful.

I had to put down my beloved dog of 13 years, Gibbs, last week, a very difficult decision.   
  
It likely would not have been possible to even get him to our vet to be euthanized, but even had it been possible, as much as I love my vet, I couldn't imagine having to endure such an emotional experience outside of my home. More importantly, I couldn't imagine putting Gibbs through this, I wanted him to pass in his home environment that he had grown so accustomed and comfortable in.  
  
Thanks to Rider Veterinary Services, this was made possible. Dr. Rider was wonderful and took the time to get to know Gibbs and our family prior to the euthanasia. Dr. Rider was gentle, kind, compassionate, and gave us privacy after he passed to spend time with Gibbs. Four days later, I even received a handwritten card with Gibbs paw prints on it from Dr. Rider.   
  
Should you have to ever make this most difficult decision for your own pet, I highly recommend utilizing the compassionate and dignity filled services of Rider Veterinary Services.

Within two hours Dr. Rider responded and within another two hours she was at our house helping us. We were so desperate and Dr. Rider was right there for us. I could not say enough good things about this amazing lady. She even helped us get a paw print to remember our amazing Rosie. Thank you so so much Dr. Rider!

Dr. Rider was amazing as we made the hardest but kindest decision to bid farewell to our sweet ol’ girl Thora. Dr. Rider came to know Thora’s medical history and treated her as an individual. When that hard evening came, she talked to our family as if we were friends, and Thora as if she were her own dog. She was very thorough in her explanations, and despite the awful situation, it was as we were friends.   
Our grieving process has been, as you can imagine, very difficult. However, there is an ease knowing that Thora passed away in my arms with Dr. Rider’s gentle assistance. I cannot thank her enough for this.  
Edit to add: Dr. Rider also sent us a heartfelt, personal card. I read it at a point in the day when I really needed to. Thank you.

Dr. Rider helped us through one of the most difficult experiences that pet parents face - saying goodbye to our 15yr old husky Havok. I was nervous having someone we didn't have a previously established relationship with come to the house, but that fear was eased shortly after she arrived.   
  
Dr. Rider is the vet you want during those difficult times. She is compassionate, takes her to time to evaluate the situation before confirming that you're making the right decision, is honest about options and potential time frames if you are on the fence of making a decision. She gave us as much time as we needed to say goodbye to our boy. Working in the vet field I've worked alongside a lot of vets and she's one of the good ones! I'm so thankful to her for coming on short notice and being the support we needed during that difficult time. If you're on the fence about at home euthanasia like I was, don't be. It was such a peaceful experience, my boy was in an environment he was comfortable in. No hussle and bustle of a hospital or stress and I was allowed to mourn freely. Thank you Dr. Rider for your kindness during a heart breaking time.

Dr Rider is the most professional, caring and informative vet I have ever experienced. Her knowledge of eastern modalities to heal and support our dogs is unparalleled .I highly recommend her clinic for the care of my 4 dogs and I know anyone will feel the same.

Absolutely recommend Dr Rider. My dog always seems like he feels better after her treatments. As a bonus, my dog is always happy to see her!

I can’t express how fortunate we feel to have found Hello Harmony Vet. She provided several services right in our home, giving us hope that our senior dog can enjoy better mobility and an improved quality of life.

I can’t imagine having to load up our sweet girl, who hates car rides, who hates going to the vet, having to have her pass away on a cold table, with limited time because there are other appointments and then to drive home sobbing - this is such a blessing. Dr Rider was incredible, compassionate and I would not have had this any other way. Thank you so much for doing what you do, I cannot imagine it’s easy but we are so grateful.

Dr. Rider is a very special person. The at home euthanasia service she offers is top tier. She explains the process thoroughly before doing anything and makes you feel at ease. I went to shake her hand before she left and she swatted it away and gave me a big hug. I'll never forget that. Thank you Dr. Rider for everything you do and the amazing service you offer.

Dr Rider is kind, compassionate, experienced, loving , caring... I could go on and on. I was an emotional mess and she took the time to support and guide me through the process to help my sweet girl pass on. She soothed my anxieties and I'm forever grateful. My girl had a peaceful passing while in her bed, with her family around, her dog brother playing with a loud squeaky toy the entire time. Dr Rider took one look at my girl and knew everything she needed to know, she is the dog whisperer.Thank you Dr Rider. I appreciate you. Laska in heaven says thank you too.

I could not have asked for a more compassionate and empathetic experience for ANY family member, human or animal.We knew our pet's final moments shouldn't be in a car (which he hated) or in a strange building (which was always stressful). We wanted him put down at home for his sake, and so we could grieve privately.It's hard to write this review without tearing up (even 10 months after the event), and that's why I cannot say enough about this service. So kind, so gentle, so caring. Everything was taken care of with such thoughtfulness - a sign of experience and someone with a calling for what they do.The cost isn't insignificant, but I wouldn't have it any other way.

Dr. Rider is nothing short of amazing. The courage she possesses to do what she does is astounding. She provided so much compassion, sincerity, and kindness to my baby Cooper while he was crossing over. Dr. Rider made the entire experience manageable for us at such a devastating time, especially me. She not only texted with me the night before instructing me on how to keep him comfortable, she came first thing the next morning. She did not have to go out of her way to do that but she did and it meant the world to me. I'll never forget her reassurance that we were making the right decision. She treated Coop like he was her own and I can't thank her enough. I wanted the experience to be painless and peaceful for him and she did just that. I'm crying as I write this because it's so wonderful to know there are such good people in this world. What she does day after day is hard. She is very much appreciated and highly recommend by me.

I had to put my girl Bessie down the other day. I was so distraught that I couldn't even talk on the phone to schedule the appointment. But Dr Rider came and did some kind of magic and made it a lot easier than I was expecting. Both her and Heather helped to make a make a horrible situation more tolerable. Thanks to both of you for getting me through the death of my baby girl. Tom
