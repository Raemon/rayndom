## Pet Tele-Health

(Available for current clients only)

  * Tele-health sessions are a video, phone or email chat with you and a video exam of your pet if warrented. Tele-Health sessions are helpful when:
  * A visual recheck is sufficient for a recent issue that Dr. Rider has seen your pet for. 
  * You need to quarantine for health issues
  * You want Dr. Rider’s professional second opinion or professional input regarding information you read online, supplements, etc. 



In-depth emails/phone calls/ texting, regarding disease consultation, questions regarding new issues/ concerns, in-depth food therapy questions, and hospice consultations do incur a minimum $25 consultation fee. Of course, we are always happy to answer some quick questions about clarifications, for clients at no fee! However, questions requiring research (specific diets, product research like CBD oils/ food/ supplements, etc), and complicated discussions about disease progression, addressing new signs and symptoms take a substantial amount of time and need to be booked in the doctor’s schedule to make sure you and your pet’s needs are being addressed.

*Please Note: Without conducting an in-person physical examination, our tele-health service cannot diagnose, treat, or prevent disease, illness, or pain UNLESS you are a current client with a recent exam. Our purpose is to provide general guidance for concerned pet parents.
