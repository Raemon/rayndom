## Veterinary hospice is not prolonging suffering, it's goal is to prevent suffering from occurring

### What is Pet Hospice?

#### 

Hospice is simply a supervised medical service dedicated to providing comfort and quality of life for the pet (and the caregivers) until euthanasia is elected or natural death occurs. It focuses on managing symptoms in geriatric pets, such as pain, weakness, behavior changes, and focuses on your pet's happiness.

We understand your aging pet may have other issues besides pain, like urinary incontinence, skin & ear issues, and behavior changes. We take a holistic approach to your pet's health. 

[ __ Learn more ](https://ridervetservice.com/pet-hospice-and-in-home-euthanasia/pet-hospice/)

#### Palliative care is utilized for advanced, progressive chronic disease, life-limiting disease, and terminal illness limitations. 

### House Calls

We understand the challenges of providing care to geriatric pets. Getting an arthritic & anxious pet out of the home can be difficult for both of you. 

To serve you and your pet better, a mobile veterinarian will come to your home to perform an exam & counsel you on geriatric pet care, end-stage disease and administer therapies to make your pet more comfortable and happy.

#### Frequently Asked Questions

## Understanding the Pet Euthanasia Process

____ Step 1: Deciding when it's time

Every pet-loss journey is different. We all want as much quality time with our beloved furlings as possible. When quality of life deteriorates and there is little hope of recovery, it is time to consider humane euthanasia. When trying to make this decision, we recommend considering some of the following:

People will say you will “know” it’s time. Please understand, it frequently isn’t that simple. Give yourself some grace and know that is feels un-natural to make this decision for a loved one. However, are your pet’s champion, you are best suited to make this decision. 

Take a quality of life assessment which can provide some objectivity to subjective evaluation of your pet’s wellbeing. 

Although our pet’s can’t talk, they communicate with us all the time. Listen to your pet. Some ways they tell us they are uncomfortable or not doing well are: 

Your pet no longer enjoys things they once did, like walks, pets, company, playing, etc

Your pet has more bad days than good. 

Your pet is constantly anxious: paces, is restless, has days and nights mixed up.

Your pet has severe mobility issues: falls easily, is risk for being injured due to falls, can’t posture to urinate and defecate

Your veterinarian can help you assess your pet’s quality of life. 

____ Step 2: Book an appointment

Once you have decided that it is time to help your pet pass, you can conveniently book an appointment right [on-line](https://calendly.com/ridervetservices/euthanasia). 

**Note** : If you need to reschedule, postpone or cancel your appointment, you can do so using link provided in your confirmation email/ booking confirmation page. 

____ Step 3: Prepare for the appointment

It’s OK to spoil your pet with special dinners, treats, company, etc. 

Continue to give your pet’s medications as prescribed. We want them to be as comfortbale as possible

Speaking of comfort, manypeople are tempted to give their pets THC/ marijuana products. Please DO NOT do this. It severely affects the medications the doctor will give and can cause tremors, hyperexcitability, urinary incontinence, twitching and excessive drooling. 

**Location.** Decide where you and your pet will be most comfortable: floor, sofa, favorite bed, closet, outdoors, in your arms, etc. Many pets enjoy being outside and we can certainly accommodate this! However, in inclement weather (raining, dark/dusk, excessive heat/cold, biting insects, etc), we may need to make some adjustments to make sure everything goes smoothly. 

**Parking.** In winter, please be sure parking areas are free of snow and ice as well as walkways and steps to the home. If you are requesting cremation and transportation services, we will need easy and _close_ access to the home. For the safety of our staff, please make sure there is parking in the drive or directly in front of the home no matter what the weather conditions are. 

You are welcome to take pictures, invite family members via video chat, etc. However, we simply request you not video film the process. 

____ Step 4: Arrival of the veterinarian

If you have any doubts, questions, etc, the veterinarian would be honored to assess your pet and answer any questions you have. 

Once you are comfortable in your decision to proceed with in home euthanasia, the veterinarian will confirm your aftercare wishes, take payment and then explain the procedure and answer any additional questions you may have. 

____ Step 5: Understanding the Euthanasia procedure

  1. Assessment and answer any questions
  2. Sedation and anesthesia. Your pet will be given two injections. The first contains a pain medication, a sedative and an anti-anxiety medication. This is injected under the skin while your pet is distracted with treats or loving pets from you. it can take 2-10 minutes for your pet to get nice a sleepy. 
  3. Euthanasia. The second injection typically goes into the vein and is an overdose of anesthetic. This injection allows your pet to transition and pass peacefully. 
  4. The most common things that may occure with pass is a change in respiration, sometiems faster, slower, deeper or more shallow and that the pet may not close their eyes. Rarely you may see very fine muscle fasciculations and energy leave the body. This is all normal. If you have any questions about things you observe, always feel free to ask. 
  5. Taking the time to Grieve. After your pet passes, you will be given some privacy. If the doctor is assisting with cremation, you can let them know when you are ready for them to rejoin you. 



____ Step 6: Cremation and After Care

If you choose cremation services, the doctor will take your beloved pet to the cremation facility. The crematorium will call when your pet’s ashes are ready to pick up. 

____ Why consider in home Pet Euthanasia?

Because it is an honor to provide this last loving act with you for your friend. I personally would want to say good bye to my furry friends where they are most comfortable and happy, and that is what I want to do for you too. Although your grief is shared, it truly is humbling to be present and trusted with this final journey with your loved one. 

____ Is in home euthanasia better?

When and where you and your family decide euthanasia is the best treatment for your pet is highly personal. If you are more comfortable in a veterinary clinic, then we recommend you go this route. 

However, many people desire saying goodbye to their pets in the privacy and comfort of their home. Not only does it make the experience more personal, but people realize their pet is usually more relaxed and comfortable at home. The idea of knowing a loved one is able to pass where they are most happy: in the living room, the back yard, the bed of the truck seems to put us humans at ease. 

Again, this is your family’s decision. At Hello Harmony Vet we want you to know that we support you. If you decide to say goodbye at your home, we hope you will allow us the honor of serving you and your loved one. 

____ What does Euthanasia mean ?

“Euthanasia” literally means “Good Death”. You can expect the utmost care and attention to detail when we are performing end of life services. Veterinarians are the only licensed professionals gifted with the ability to perform this act. Ending suffering for a terminally ill pet is a gift of love. 

____ Does Euthanasia Hurt ?

No, euthanasia does not hurt. Your furling will be fully sedated. At that point, he/she cannot feel anything, just as if they were going into surgery. Additional anesthetic is given that ceases brain activity and allows the body to painlessly release its energy. 

Occasionally with anesthesia, the breathing rate can change: it can increase, decrease, or become deeper or more shallow. These are all normal and do not indicate that your pet is in distress. 

____ How can I prepare ?

The veterinarian will explain the entire process once they arrive. You and your pet will be in control of the pace of the appointment.

Select a place you would like to be with your pet. Pets really enjoy being outdoors, some in the car, others on the couch or the kitchen floor. Wherever you feel your family and pet will be most happy. 

A sedative is given to your pet to assist in the ease of transition and to make sure your pet is comfortable. It can take 2-10 minutes for them to get nice and sleepy. Once you and your pet are ready, the final act of euthanasia is gifted. Passing can occur quickly, often within seconds, but may take 2-3 minutes. Your pet is unconscious and cannot feel anything. The veterinarian will then confirm your pet’s passing. After they have transitioned over the Rainbow Bridge, you can spend as much time as you wish with your friend. A paw print will then be made and hair clipped if you desire. 

____ Should my other pets be present?

If you would like your other pets to be present, this is absolutely an option. It is best to keep fearful, skiddish, or rambunctious brothers and sisters in a separate room until their brother/sister has passed, then allow them the opportunity to say good-bye. 

____ Is it OK to have my children present?

This is a very personal family decision. If it is your wish, we are happy to share this experience with all family members. For additional information and resources on this topic, please visit [FAQ Children and Euthanasia](https://www.lapoflove.com/FAQ#Should%20children%20be%20present%20during%20the%20euthanasia). There can be hazards having young toddlers present, as there are needles, etc. Young children may also feel the vet is hurting your pet by using needles, etc. The same is true for individuals with Alzheimer’s or certain other cognitive disorders. We strongly recommend that toddlers and those with degenerative cognitive disorders be spared the confusion of losing their pet this way. 

____ Do Families have to be present for euthanasia?

There is no right or wrong answer. Being present durring your pet’s euthanasia is a personal decision. Some people want to be there for the entire process. However, others step out of the room and return for a final visitation once the pet is gone. 

____ How will my pet's remains be handled ?

You can opt to bury your pet if local ordinances allow this. If you wish to choose this option, we will discuss proper burial methods for euthanized pets. 

Cremation is very popular. We can transport your pet’s remains for you to deliver at the crematorium of our choice (pls see prices above). Be assured that we will always treat your friend’s remains with respect and dignity. If you prefer to deliver your pet’s remains yourself, there are several options for these services. You can also arrange for your pet’s remains to be picked up by the crematorium of your choice after the euthanasia (typical transport costs range from $200-300). The following are a list of local services:

____ How much notice is needed?

48 hours notice is ideal. However, we understand that both life and death are unpredictable. A 24 hour notice may not be possible in your situation. We try to be accommodating as possible, but please note we do not offer services 24/7. 

____ Pet Grief Resources

The pets in our lives are considered friends, family members, sources of support, and providers of unconditional love. Their loss leads to grieving similar to any other significant loss of life. Grief is a normal, natural process following the loss of a loved one, whether it be human or animal. However, it can be difficult to navigate the emotions associated with grief including the physical effects (like headache, loss, of appetite, exhaustion), emotional effects (anger, guilt, sadness) and the behavioral effects (crying, withdrawal, change of relationships). 

It is important that following the loss of a beloved pet, you allow yourself to grieve. Surround yourself with others who understand the bond you had with your companion. Be patient with yourself. If you feel you need additional support following the loss of a companion, please use the following information to obtain supportive, non-judgmental assistance:
