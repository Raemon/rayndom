## Laser Therapy

[ __ Contact Us ](https://ridervetservice.com/pet-hospice-in-home-euthanasia-contact-us/)

Laser therapy uses low level (“cold” laser) light to stimulate healing. It is also referred to as “LLLT”. Lasers are frequently used to increase surgical wound healing time, treating mastitis, skin infections, wounds, joint and muscle pain, burns, and even bladder and intestinal inflammation. Use is wide spread in sports medicine and rehabilitation. 

Low level laser therapy can be paired with other modalities to further improve treatment outcome. It is a non-invasive procedure that most pets tolerate well. It is an excellent tool in pain management and can improve your pet’s quality of life. 

## Laser Therapy can be used to treat:

  * Muscle and joint disorders
  * Bladder inflammation and pain
  * Wounds 
  * Skin infections and inflammation
  * GI Inflammation

____ Appointment Duration ?

Initial appointment is about 60 minutes, following appointments are usually 30 minutes. 

____ How to prepare your pet for an appointment

We like to provide treats and little snacks for your pet to keep them happy and comfortable. Please let us know what your pet’s favorite treats are so we can have it or something similar on hand. 

It also helps to have your pet a little hungry so they will take treats more readily from us. Sharing food is a great way for us to become friends. 

If your pet is on a special diet or you would prefer to supply the treats, please let us know! 

We like your pet to be in a comfortable, quiet area free from distractions. This might be on the couch, floor, blanket, cat tree or pet bed. But we should avoid heavily woven type blankets and fabrics as it can be hard to recover all of the needles. 

If you have other pets, it is often helpful to have them occupied in another room or outdoors. The same is true for younger children or other family members that might be a distraction (think others getting a snack… I don’t know about you but my fur kids would have to be in a coma to not crowd in the kitchen). Please try and schedule appointments when the home is at a low activity level. 

____ IN-HOME INITIAL Laser Treatment

Full patient assessment, exam, and consultation to address your concerns. Treatment recommendations, cold laser therapy and massage. Includes house call fee. 

$120 (45-60 minutes)

____ WHAT TO EXPECT DURING AN APPOINTMENT

We like to spend the first 10-15 minutes getting to know your pet. We will get an initial assessment of your pet and your primary concerns. It is also important for to understand your goals. In addition, your pet’s current treatment plan, medications, and how you feel they are responding to treatments over time will be addressed. 

Once a full history is obtained, the veterinarian will take the time to perform a full exam of your pet. This helps them understand your pet’s current state and develop an acupuncture treatment protocol. 

Then laser therapy is applied to the necessary problem areas. This can take 10-30 minutes depending on the size of your pet and the area to be treated.
