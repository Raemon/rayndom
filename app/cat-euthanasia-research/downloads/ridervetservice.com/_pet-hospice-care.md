## Pet Hospice Care

[ __ MAKE AN aPPOINTMENT ](https://ridervetservice.com/contact-us/)

Most people have difficulty knowing if their geriatric pet is in pain or if it is time for peaceful euthanasia. We support families through the last steps of this journey by providing in home pet hospice and palliative care services. Our wish is to empower pet care givers to make important decisions for their geriatric pets and to alleviate fears while traversing this part of the journey. Pet hospice care is about increasing the quality of your pet’s life. When it is time, we are honored to assist in giving them your last act of love. 

As seniors transition into geriatric pets, it is often assumed little can be done to alleviate mobility issues, pain, anxiety, etc. Many of our senior and geriatric pets do very well. Therefore families feel it’s just not time to say good bye. However, is important to understand that there are many treatments available that can address and alleviate symptoms pet owners may notice. Some of these include joint pain, muscle weakness, cognitive disorders, urinary incontinence, skin infections, occasional vomiting, weight loss and diarrhea, etc. 

## Caring beyond a cure

When they are beyond a cure, we can use palliative and hospice care to focus on your pet’s happiness by addressing pain, discomfort and anxiety. We call this caring beyond a cure. Hospice care is not about prolonging suffering, but about alleviating suffering until it is time to say good bye through peaceful euthanasia. Simply put, Hospice, is a medically supervised service dedicated to providing comfort and quality of life for the pet (and the owners) until euthanasia is elected or natural death occurs.

### Our Five-Step Strategy for Comprehensive Hospice and Palliative Care:

  1. Evaluation of the caregiver’s needs, beliefs and goals
  2. Education about the disease process
  3. Development of a personalized plan for the pet and caregiver
  4. Application of techniques
  5. Emotional support during the care process



### 

Our family centered care exists to ease fears and to empower pet care givers to make important health care decisions for their aging pets.

____ whAT TO EXPECT DURRING AN APPOINTMENT

We like to spend the first 10-15 minutes getting to know your pet. This time is taken to get an initial assessment of your pet and your primary concerns. It is also important for us to understand your goals. Important information includes your pet’s current treatment plan, medications, and how you feel they are responding to any past or current treatments. 

Once the vet obtains a full history, they will take the time to perform a full exam of your pet. This helps the vet understand your pet’s current state and develop a treatment protocol. 

____ Telemedcine

Telemedicine are consults with a medical professional via phone, email, video chat, pictures, etc. The purpose is to update the veterinarian on new conditions, adjust treatment plans and quickly advise in possible emergency situations. 

When a medical relationship has already been established, this can be a tool to deliver excellent quality medicine in a timely manner. While telemedicine cannot always replace an hands-on exam of your pet, when applicable, it can advance the quality of medicine your pet receives saving time and money for your family ($50/ 30 min).
