### We want to help your Pet! Help us help you 

### How we communicate:

This website is designed with _you_ in mind! You’ll find lots of helpful info here, including the services we offer, pricing, and more. 👉 Please take a moment to look around before reaching out — especially to see if we’re the right fit for your needs. _(We do not offer general wellness care, emergency services, or surgery.)_

Because we don’t have dedicated reception staff, and Dr. Rider is often driving or with a patient, we’re not able to answer most calls during business hours. We also cannot return voicemails asking about services we don’t provide.

If you do call, please **leave a clear message** with your name, your pet’s needs, and how we can help. Vague messages like “please call me” may not receive a response.

💛 We understand that online forms or emails aren’t accessible for everyone. If you have a disability or a barrier to digital communication, we _absolutely welcome your call_ — just leave a message and we’ll get back to you.

We prioritize returning calls for in-home euthanasia services and will respond to established clients within **24 business hours**.
