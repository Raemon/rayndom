## **Pet Tele-Advice for Hospice & Euthanasia**

  * Tele-advice sessions include a 30 minute phone or video chat with Dr. Rider. We can discuss anything from what to expect with certain disease processes, discussing options for keeping your pet comfortable, and assessing quality of life for your pet.
  * We can outline the next best steps for your pet
  * Our goal is to empower and support you to make the best decisions for your pet during this difficult time



*Disclaimer: without conducting an in-person physical exam, our tele-advice service can not diagnose, treat, or prevent disease, illness or pain. Our purpose is to provide general guidance for the concerned pet caregiver in your time of need. 

#### What you pay for:

$48 for up to 30 minute session

Caring for an aging pet can present challenges and so much uncertainty, but you don’t have to face it alone. Our telehospice service is available to provide the support and guidance you need. 

### What can you expect from Tele-Advice?

During a tele-advice/ tele-hospice session, you will be able to speak with Dr. Rider who is a certified Hospice and palliative care veterinarian. You can elect a Zoom session for face-to-face time. We also offer telephone sessions if you are more comfortable with that modality. During your call we will discuss different ways your pet’s quality of life may be changing and what can be done to help. Our desire is to support you in your pet care goals and reinforce the threads of the human-animal bond. We recognize that for many of us, this bond represents one of friendship, love, and devotion. Thus we recognize the critical importance of supporting you during this trying time.

### Tele-Advice can help answer some of the following questions:

  * How will I know it’s time?
  * Are there ways I can help my pet with mobility issues?
  * How can I make my pet more comfortable through the last leg of this journey?
  * I want to know more about euthanasia in general
  * How can I get my pet to eat and drink more?
  * Should I take my pet the emergency hospital?
  * Is there a better way to get medications in my pet?
  * How with this disease progress and affect my pet over time?
