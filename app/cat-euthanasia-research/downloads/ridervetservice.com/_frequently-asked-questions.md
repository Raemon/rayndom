## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

____ What is the best way to book an appointment?

The best way to book an appointment is through our on-line booking portal. 

**– Returning clients** should use the portal to see available times and book accordingly. 

**– New clients** should fill out the “[contact form](https://ridervetservice.com/pet-hospice-in-home-euthanasia-contact-us/)” and you will be contacted with a link to book an appointment. 

Please note Dr. Rider operates her practice via her website, online forms & email communication so that she can focus on patient care and safe driving. On demand reception staff is not available for this small, concierge veterinary business. 

  * If you have disabilities or have difficulties with on-line formats, please call and leave us a  _detailed_ message indicating you need help booking an appointment and we are happy to reach out and help! 



____ What are your hours of operation?

Hours of operation are Monday through Thursday 9am -5pm and Friday 9am-3pm. HOWEVER, office hours vary. Dr. Rider balances her time between seeing patients in the clinic and at their home. We want to make sure you get the service you need. The operations are nearly a one person show! Therefore office visits are by appointment only, which includes seeing pets, doctor consults and picking up medications or supplies. 

____ How do I use the on-line calendar?

When using the on-line booking portal/ calendar the first thing to consider is what type of appointment you need: In-home Euthanasia, House call, New patient, Follow-up or Hospice Care. 

**In-home Euthanasia:** To book an in-home euthanasia right away, use our on-line calendar [here](https://calendly.com/ridervetservices/euthanasia). If you’re not quite ready for that step, please see our [In-home Euthanasia page](https://ridervetservice.com/in-home-pet-euthanasia/) for detailed information on this process, frequently asked questions and pricing, after care of your pet, and more. 

**House Calls** : For Doctor to home to your home, select “House Call” appointment. If you want acupuncture but you need Dr. Rider to come to your home, you select the “House Call” button. If you need a house call, always select this option and then indicate why type of services you are wanting. If you want an in-home euthanasia for your pet, you select the pink “In-home Euthanasia” button at the top of our [contact page](https://ridervetservice.com/pet-hospice-in-home-euthanasia-contact-us/) or the “In-home Euthanasia” appointment type. All other services listed are for CLINIC appointments only. 

**Clinic Appointment:** If you are bringing your pet to the clinic and Dr. Rider hasn’t seen the pet before, please select “New Patient/ 1st Consult”. If your pet is returning for follow up services, please select “Follow-up/ Recheck Consult”. If you are specifically interested in Hospice and Palliative Care for your pet, you can select this option. 

____ How long are appointments?

Appoints at the clinic range from 30-60 minutes depending on the type of appointment. House call appointments are about 45-60 minutes long. 

____ What are your fees?

We have an all-inclusive pricing concept so you can focus on your pets healing instead of worrying about add-on costs, cumbersome pricing packages, etc. There are no extra fees for individual integrative services. 

Integrative 1st visit: $210. Includes 60 minute session, complete Western / Eastern exam, recommended therapies such as acupuncture, chiro, massage, laser, mini food therapy consult, herbal consult — if desired). Medications & travel fee are  _not_ included. Savings compared to a la carte: $50- 106

  


Integrative pet care recheck/ follow-up: The investment for your furling’s ongoing care is determined by their individual treatment plan, the average fee is only $120 per follow-up visit. Medications & travel fee are  _not_ included. Savings Savings compared to a la carte $35- 80.

All In-home euthanasia pricing depends on the size of the pet and after care wishes. All prices can be found on the [In Home Euthanasia](https://ridervetservice.com/in-home-pet-euthanasia/) web page. 

____ Why should my pet have an empty stomach before treatments?

When the stomach has food in it, the body is focusing on digesting. This requires increased blood flow to the area, complex neuroendocrine activities, etc. We want the body to be able to respond to focus on responding to the treatments. Also, if you have you know your pet gets nervous at the vet, does take treats, etc, it’s better to skin an entire meal or pull up your pet’s food the morning of the appointment (night before depend on the time). This way we can use food to help calm your pet and change it’s emotional state.
