## Herbal Refills

Hello! And thank you for refilling your pet’s herbal medications. 

All herbal refill requests must use the **[form found HERE](https://form.jotform.com/250398025192154).** Once filled out, your request will be approved and your method of payment billed. If your request is denied (common causes: incorrect product selected, out of stock, etc) you will be notified within 1 business day and we will assist you further.

If you do not see your herbal listed or aren’t sure what you need to refill, just send us an email (ridervetservices@gmail.com) with your name, pet’s name and that you need an herbal refill — we can help!

### Important Herbal Refill Information

  * Due to the nature of my mobile practice and my schedule, I will no longer be able to accommodate medication pick ups. Moving forward, all medications will be shipped or they can be picked up at your next appointment. 
  * Due to shipping times, possible back orders, natural disasters, etc, please be aware of possible herbal shipping delays. It is recommended to place refill ordered two weeks before running out of herbal medications. 
  * Expedited shipping is available for many herbal manufacturers and is $15.00. When checking out, please select this option for faster shipping. 
  * Please allow 1-2 business days for refill requests to be processed in-house. 
  * Pharmaceuticals like shampoos, antibiotics, heartworm prevention, etc can be purchased [**HERE**](https://www.myvetstoreonline.pharmacy).
