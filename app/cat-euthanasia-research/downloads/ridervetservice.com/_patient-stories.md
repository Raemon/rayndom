## Meet our Patients

Following are real patient stories. Their ailments range from severe congestive heart failure to anxiety to irretractable pain. Many of them came as referrals by their amazing full-service veterinarians. Some clients found Dr. Rider out of desperation and not knowing what else they could do for their pets.

### Lula's Heart- Congestive heart failure & hospice care

Lula was diagnosed with severe chronic right sided heart failure. Due to her condition, fluid builds up into the free space in her abdomen. This fluid can create intense pressure on major internal blood vessels and organs, causing them to shut down, leading to death. Being a professional hospice caregiver herself, Lula’s human contact Dr. Rider to see if anything could be done to make little Lula more comfortable. After exam, her heart medications were updated and fluid was drawn off her abdomen. Almost every week since May 2023, Lula has fluid removed from her abdomen, making her more perky, helping her to eat better, and live her best life for the time that she has. Without this treatment and hospice care, Lula’s humans would surely have had to say goodbye to her months ago.

### Max Undone- Geriatric canine anxiety

Max was adopted as a senior pet… and came with a lot of baggage. His anxiety progressed, becoming so severe his human couldn’t leave the house. Any time he was alone, he barked non-stop for hours, drooled and cried. Despite his new human being given the advice to peacefully help him pass, she just couldn’t give up on him. When He met Dr. Rider, he was on 3 different anxiety medications, at high doses. After a couple of acupuncture sessions and starting herbal medication, his human noticed a big difference. Fast forward several months and he is off all of his anxiety medications but one. His coat is thicker and he can now get around without the help of his mobility harness. Max continues to do well…maybe a little too well according to his human!

### Ella's Angry Liver- Chronic hepatitis

Ella had been seeing her regular veterinarian for nearly a year for severely elevated liver enzymes. Blood work and an ultrasound showed now signs of cancer, just severe inflammation. Despite several medications, her liver enzymes remained persistently high. Ella visted Dr. Rider for acupuncture and herbal medication and after 3 months all of her liver values were normal except one, ant that too and decrease by almost 1,000 points. Ella remains on her herbal medications for maintenance and a special food therapy regiment and is doing very well.

### Mischief’s boat in a dry river- Kitty constipation

Mischief saw Dr. Rider after battling severe constipation on and off for well over a year. His human decided to make one last ditch effort before considering a severe and invasive surgery where part of his colon would be removed. After just a few sessions of acupuncture, in addition to adjustments, a diet change and some simple over the counter medications, he went from lethargic, vomiting daily, not eating and looking like a 15 year old cat to sexy, sassy, and looking like a Panther King!

### Cody's bum leg- Canine arthritis

Cody was referred by his primary veterinarian and specialty center for favoring the right rear leg. He had previously had surgery on that hip and had knee surgery on the left leg. No matter what they did for medications, he still favored the right back leg. After just one session he showed improvement. Now he wants to go on walks again, is playing with other dogs and doing well. and now Cody is doing very well, going for walks, playing etc.

### Banjo- Food allergies and GI Issues

Banjo is a young fellow who was losing weight, not wanting to eat and having some skin issues as well. His human did all of the testing (blood work, fecals, radiographs, ultrasound, etc), tried many Western medications and nothing helped. After using food therapy, a little acupuncture, and herbal medication, Banjo did well for a long time. He is a young man and still a work in progress but is doing well.
