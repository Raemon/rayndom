## Why Pet Hospice or Palliative Care?

#### Euthanasia Isn't the only option: Veterinary HOspice Care

When you hear “there is no cure” or “she’s just getting old”, there may be other options besides euthanasia. **Veterinary hospice (Pet Hospice or Pawspice) and palliative care** is a unique approach to your pet’s healthcare needs. It focuses on managing symptoms, like pain, weakness, anxiety and **focuses on** **your pet’s happiness and quality of life. Hello Harmony Vet and Dr. Rider are dedicated to providing senior and geriatric care, palliative care, hospice care and in-home euthanasia for dedicated families in the Quad Cities.**

Our family-centered care exists to ease fears and to empower pet caregivers to make important healthcare decisions for their pets. 

## Veterinary Hospice is not about prolonging suffering; it is about improving the quality of your pet's life

#### "I don't think it's time..."

As pets age, they experience many similar changes as humans. As pets transition from senior to geriatric, they can experience stiff joints, decrease exercise tolerance, weakness, decreased weight, advanced dental disease, behavior changes, frequent urinary tract infections or incontinence. To sum it up…they just seem more frail. 

Even though owners note changes in their pet, like joint pain, decreased interaction, odd behavior, etc; they may feels it’s just not time for euthanasia. Frequently owners observe that other parts of their life are good: appetite, the pets still enjoy walks, get excited when they return home, etc. 

Those symptoms, although certainly not fatal, are disease processes, and tend to compound with age. Arthritis is painful. Dental disease is painful. Urinary tract infections are painful and urine leaking can cause skin infections and pain. Behavior changes can include anxiety, which can be hard for owners to watch. 

We can help! There are so many ways for your pet to live a more comfortable life in their geriatric years. Let us help you make the home stretch of your journey together in this world more comfortable. 

  


  


#### House calls are important

Having your pet remain in the comfort of his/her own home decreases stress and anxiety. If your pet has mobility issues, getting them in and out of the car can be a painful experience for you and them. Car rides can be very stressful for cats. 

**It’s convenient for you!** No long waits in the waiting room or exam rooms, telling your pet’s history to three different people and wondering if you will get home in time to meet the kids off the bus. **Breath easy and let us come to you!**************

#### Specifically, what things can you do for my pet?

There are many things that can be done to help your pet in their golden years and end-of-life stage. Some include, but not limited to, are:

  * Pain medication
  * Acupuncture
  * Massage
  * Anxiety medication and behavior modification
  * Nutrition



Education about end-stage diseases, recognizing and treating pain, subcutaneous fluids, managing urinary incontinence, addressing anxiety and special nutritional needs, skin & wound care, and much more.
