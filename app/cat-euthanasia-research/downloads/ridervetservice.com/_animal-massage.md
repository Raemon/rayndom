# Animal Massage

[ __ Contact Us ](https://ridervetservice.com/pet-hospice-in-home-euthanasia-contact-us/)

## Massage for Pets

Animal massage is an important, gentle, hands-on therapy for healing. Massage is used to decrease muscle tension and tone, release painful trigger points & fascia, and restore range of motion after injuries or surgery. It can also increase muscle tone where needed, as well as increase circulation to help decrease pain and nourish tendons and ligaments. Specific massage styles can be applied to trigger points and acupuncture points, and help neurologic communication (energy) along acupuncture meridians. Animal massage also increases blood and lymphatic circulation and can help improve the immune system. 

In rare occasions where pets do not tolerate needles, a special type of massage called Tui-na can be used. Tui-na is an entire branch of holistic medicine that can be used in in conjunction with other manual therapies and herbal medications to facilitate healing and balance. Pet massage is a safe and effective treatment with no known side effects when used correctly and can be taught to pet caregivers to perform at home with amazing results!

## Laser Therapy

Laser therapy, or photobiomodulation, uses low level laser energy applied to specific areas of the body to help with decreasing inflammation, swelling and pain. In laser therapy, light at specific energies cause changes at the cellular level. These changes increase energy available to cells and therefore tissue for healing. Laser therapy can decrease inflammatory factors and decrease pian transmission. Therefore, laser therapy has MANY uses and is often combined with other therapies such as acupuncture, chiropractic adjustments, massage, herbal medication and drugs. 

**Some common uses for laser therapy include:**

skin wounds, hot spots, ear infections, post-surgery, osteoarthritis, intervertebral disc disease, ear infections, mastitis, and acral lick granulomas, to name a few.

____ How to prepare your pet for a manual therapy appointment

We like to provide treats and little snacks for your pet to keep them happy and comfortable. Please let us know what your pet’s favorite treats are so we can have it or something similar on hand. 

It also helps to have your pet a little hungry so they will take treats more readily from us. Sharing food is a great way for us to become friends. Also, it’s better to NOT receive manual therapies within 30 minutes after a meal. 

If your pet is on a special diet or you would prefer to supply the treats, please let us know! 

We like your pet to be in a comfortable, quiet area free from distractions. A small room with quiet music can be very soothing for pets. Comfortable areas might be on the couch, floor, blanket, cat tree or pet bed. But we should avoid heavily woven type blankets and fabrics as it can be hard to recover all of the needles. 

If you have other pets, it is often helpful to have them occupied in another room or outdoors. The same is true for younger children or other family members that might be a distraction (think others getting a snack… I don’t know about you but my fur kids would have to be in a coma to not crowd in the kitchen). Please try and schedule appointments when the home is at a low activity level.
