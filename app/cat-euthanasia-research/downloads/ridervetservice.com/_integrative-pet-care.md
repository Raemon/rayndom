## Integrative pet care, so pets can live their best life

**Integrative Pet Care** is an approach to animal health that combines conventional Western veterinary medicine with **natural** **complementary therapies**. The goal is to provide a more holistic, individually tailored, and comprehensive treatment plan for your beloved pet’s health and well-being. 

### Pricing

With our all-inclusive pricing, you can focus on your pet’s healing instead of worrying about add-on costs, pricing packages, etc.

There are no extra fees for individual integrative services.

Your furling’s visit includes a comprehensive exam, thorough consultation and any recommended integrative therapies.

#### Policies

**Appointments** – All patients are seen by appointment only. To request an appointment please email ridervetservices@gmail.com or use [our contact form](https://ridervetservice.com/pet-hospice-in-home-euthanasia-contact-us/). For house calls, **please allow 40 minutes** on either side of your appointment time for us to reach your home. If you are not prepared or present for your appointment at arrival, we may need to reschedule. Once you make your appointment, be sure to clear your schedule as the house call fee is non-refundable. 

**Preparation tips for HOUSE CALLS** – Please make sure your pet (especially cats) are easily accessible upon arrival for house calls. For example, keeping them in a carrier/crate or a bathroom is especially helpful. Some pets tend to hide when guests come over. A frantic search for a pet can increase anxiety and fear for the following appointment. We are happy to help you find and catch your pet. However, please understand we must keep appointments on time so as not to inconvenience other clients who have appointments after you. Therefore, if your appointment time runs over, we will need to re-schedule your appointment or assess an extended appointment fee. 

Please try and prepare a quiet and stress-free environment with low distractions (aka no rummaging through the fridge, containing other pets who might want all the attention, etc). 

**For all appointments,** please do not feed your pet 30 minutes prior to their appointment. If your pet needs a muzzle, please let us know or bring one with you. 

**Payment-** is due at the time of services. We prefer cash, but accept Venmo, Visa, Discover & Mastercard. There is a 3% discount for cash payments (prices listed are cash). 

**Travel Fee** – typically ranges between $75-$125+ depending on location within the Quad Cities. Additional travel distance may be available, Please email for a quote. The travel fee is non-refundable and collected at the time the appointment is booked. Extended service areas: Eldridge, Long Grove, North of I80, Walcott area, Blue Grass, Pleasant Valley, Le Claire, Orion area, Reynolds, Colona, Rapid City, Port Byron, Hillsdale. 

**TeleVet consults** – in-depth emails/phone calls/ texting, regarding disease consultation, questions regarding new issues/ concerns, in-depth food therapy questions, and hospice consultations are charged a consultation fee and available only to current clients. Of course, we are always happy to answer some quick questions about clarifications, for clients at no fee! However, questions requiring research (specific diets, product research like CBD oils/ food/ supplements, etc), and complicated discussions about disease progression, addressing new signs and symptoms take a substantial amount of time and need to be booked in the doctor’s schedule to make sure you and your pet’s needs are being addressed.
