## Compassionate Holistic Veterinary Care

### We embrace slow medicine, the foundation for holistic care. Dr. Rider used an integrative approach for all patients by blending natural modalities such as acupuncture, animal chiropractic, herbal medications, and more with conventional Western medicine. 

We are dedicated to treating pet patients and their families as individuals, not just a disease that needs to be addressed. Veterinarians by our very nature are compassionate and love animals. What Hello Harmony Vet focuses on is holistic care at all life stages. We use integrative therapies such as acupuncture, spinal care, massage, and food therapy in addition to conventional medications to address various ailments ranging from pain, indigestion, anorexia, anxiety, muscle weakness, urinary issues, diarrhea, and so much more. In addition, Hello Harmony Vet is bringing in-home euthanasia and pet hospice care to the Quad City area. 

### Our core philosophy is supporting the human-animal bond by empowering animal caregivers to provide care for their beloved pets.

Our passion is to help all pets live their best life through holistic care. We believe happy pets make happy people. We strive to alleviate pet caregiver fears surrounding pet aging and death. In essence, we want to empower people to give a peaceful and gentle goodbye to their beloved friend.

## Geriatric medicine

##### Geriatric medicine provides unique challenges to the practitioner. We need to balance the the wishes of our clients (you) and the needs of our patients. To do this successfully, communication is key. 

One challenge is the struggle pet care givers go through. For example, sometimes owners don’t know their pets are in pain or don’t feel well and we need to educate owners what discomfort looks like. Pets are really good at hiding their discomfort. Many owners recognize early and advanced signs of pain and desperately want to do something for them, but don’t know where to turn. They can even feel like other family members and friends don’t understand their stress, anxiety and heartache they are feeling.

### When is it time?

Most people have a very difficult time knowing when it is time to say good-bye to their furry friend. We support people by providing acupuncture, massage, cold laser therapy and pain medications to make them comfortable through this end-life stage. We address your personal fears and goals regarding your pet and help you transition to the peaceful goodbye you both deserve. 

That is why Dr. Rider is committed to assisting owners and pets during the last trek of their incredible journey together. And she is convinced that visiting you and your pet in your home is the best way to serve you both!

## Thoughts on in-home euthanasia and hospice care

Like every veterinarian, I have a passion for making animals well again. But sometimes our animal family members can’t be made better. I have found that delivering terminal news to pet owners that their best friend has cancer, arthritis, kidney failure or cognitive disorder (aka Alzheimers) is heart breaking. 

However, I want pet care-givers to know that your furry friends and family members don’t have to suffer. Pet hospice is palliative care that can help alleviate pain, anxiety and make your pet comfortable and happy. One thing I like people to remember is that sometimes our friends have a great attitude, eat well, etc, even though they have a terminal illness. You don’t have to let go the second you get bad news. I believe in hospice care with the goal of relieving pain & anxiety and increasing quality of life. Therefore, my goal is to work closely with you to give your pet the best quality of life while s/he remains with you.

When you feel it is time to say goodbye, you can give the last gift of love by humanely and peacefully transitioning your friend through euthanasia. I will assist your friend in crossing over the Rainbow Bridge with compassion and care. Many people believe their pets would be most happy and comfortable to share their last moments at home. Which is why I come to you! 

## Pet hospice care for my own 

My 15 year old dog, Dharma, sleeping with my blind cat, Silvie. Dharma has chronic bronchitis and moderately severe degenerative joint disease (arthritis). We need to consider treatments that balance her ability to breathe easily and keep her physically comfortable with her joint pain. Grooming can be difficult due to her arthritis and if she gets too excited, she can’t breathe. But anyone who knows her, she’s a spit-fire! She loves to play, eat, snuggle, and be sassy to strangers. It’s not her time and we manage her health issues to keep her happy and comfortable. My family’s goal is giving her a quality life.

We finally helped Dharma pass early summer of 2021. I like to think of it as giving her an upgrade. I’ll see her again.

## Our Philosophy:

### Compassionate Care

Supporting the human-animal bond during the most difficult part of the journey. Our wish is to empower animal care givers to care for their geriatric & special needs pets. When it is time, we are honored to assist in giving them your last act of love.
