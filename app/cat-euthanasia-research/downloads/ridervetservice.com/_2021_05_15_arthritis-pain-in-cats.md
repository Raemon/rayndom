# Arthritis & Joint Pain in Cats

/ [Uncategorized](https://ridervetservice.com/category/uncategorized/) / By  [ Dr. Nichollette Rider  ](https://ridervetservice.com/author/admin/ "View all posts by Dr. Nichollette Rider")

Pet care givers and many veterinarians may be surprised to learn that a majority of cats over the age of seven have arthritis and joint pain. Recent studies are shedding light on the pain-plight of domestic felines. One such study showed that over 70% of cats over the age of seven had radiographic (x-ray) evidence of joint disease. Additional studies are showing that 90% of cats 12 and older have osteoarthritis and joint pain, frequently at more severe levels. So what are these studies showing us? That we have a lot of cats that are in pain, and we didn’t even know it. Many veterinarians are rising to the challenge in addressing feline pain. Now that we know a majority of our feline patients have arthritic disease, we can do better to assess that pain and make them more comfortable. 

### What is Arthritis?

Arthritis is also known as osteoarthritis and degenerative joint disease (DJD). The condition affects the joints and is progressive and irreversible. Pain associated with DJD comes from the breakdown of the soft protective cartilage, loss of or changes in the synovial fluid in the joints, and formation or boney protrusions on what should be a smooth joint surface. Loss of surface cartilage increases bone on bone contact, creating pain. Osteophytes or bumps on the bone cause further pain. 

### What Causes Arthritis?

Many factors contribute to degenerative joint disease. Some breeds, due to genetics, are predisposed at birth for increased joint deformities. Some of these anomalies include hip dysplasia, luxating patellas, and cartilage deformities. Past injuries can also contribute to later joint pain and degeneration, such as previous fractures, hip luxations, torn tendons, etc can all lead to joint issues. Infection from bite wounds, scrapes and lacerations can also affect joints. Being overweight may not cause direct damage, however, there is evidence that obesity increases over all body inflammation and that can affect inflammation. The real damage of obesity in joint disease is increasing pain and making pre-existing joint disease worse. 

### How do we know a cat is in pain? 

Cats are really good at hiding pain. They don’t scream, cry, and whine like humans do. Chronic pain symptoms in many species are more subtle (this is true for humans too). The following are some of the most common signs of Arthritis and joint pain in cats:

#### Reduced Mobility

  1. Not jumping on counters, furniture, etc
  2. Miss-judging distances while jumping, or hesitation just before jumping up on things or not jumping up on surfaces at all. 
  3. Difficulty using stairs
  4. Appears hunched up, takes short choppy steps when moving



#### Decreased Activity

  * Cats naturally sleep a lot. You may notice more time resting or sleeping. 
  * Not playing with other pets or humans like they used to
  * Sleeping in different locations (not up high)



#### Decreased Grooming

  * Coat starts to look unkept
  * Matts begin to form
  * Nails become over grown and thickened from lack of activity and scratching
  * May overgroom over joints



#### Changes in Behavior or Temperament

  1. Avoiding humans and other animals
  2. Biting while being petted 
  3. Avoiding petting in general
  4. Hiding
  5. More cranky, irritable



### What can be done for cats with arthritic joint pain?

First you should see your veterinarian. Through an exam they can determine the likelihood your pet may have joint pain. They may also need to perform blood tests and radiographs to assess what therapies are appropriate for your pet. 

Remember, it is not possible to cure arthritis. 

The goals of managing arthritis and pain in cats is to minimize further joint damage, increase mobility and function, and alleviate pain for your pet. To achieve these goals, multiple therapies are usually needed. 

To minimize further joint damage, getting your pet to a **healthy weight** is important. Most people do not realize their pets are [overweight](https://veterinarypartner.vin.com/default.aspx?pid=19239&id=10160836), so ask your veterinarian if you have concerns. We all know exercise is important for weight loss and restoring lost muscle mass and strength. However, since your pet is in pain he/she probably won’t feel too motivated. Therefore, diet plays an important roll in weight loss. Most cats, depending on size need about 125-225 Kcalories per day. This includes anything that enters your pet’s mouth (dry food, wet/canned food, treats, people food, etc). 

**Joint supplements** can play an important roll in supporting joint health. Chondroprotectants provide building blocks to cartilage to decrease further destruction. They can also increase joint fluid and viscosity, thereby decreasing inflammation. 

There are several compounds found in joint supplements. The most common are chondroitin sulfate, glucosamine, [**polysulfated glycosamineglycan** (PSGAG)](https://veterinarypartner.vin.com/default.aspx?pid=19239&id=4952147), and microlactin. It should be noted that joint supplements alone may not alleviate pain or increase mobility if there is too much joint damage already (that is minimal cartilage left), too much inflammation, lack of analgesia (pain reduction), and variability of product quality. It is advised that if you do purchase these products – please ask your veterinarian what products are known for quality and one they trust. 

Of the mentioned, injectable PSGAGS are the most reliable, act faster and are longer lasting. This injectable product is more expensive than oral compounds like glucosamine. But research shows PSGAGS likely have superior performance in joint protection and inflammation. Ask your veterinarian if they think this product is right for your pet.

**Omega-3 fatty acids** may be able to reduce inflammation. There are many supplements and even foods fortified with Omega-3 FAs and other essential fatty acids (EFAs). There are minimal side effects to adding EFA’s to your pet’s diet and may reduce the dose of pain medication your pet needs. 

**[NSAIDs](https://veterinarypartner.vin.com/default.aspx?pid=19239&id=4952627)** (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) are often a corner stone in osteoarthritis therapy. They reduce inflammation at the joint. NSAIDs are not right for every pet. Your veterinarian may require blood work to monitor kidney and liver values. Never give your pet NSAIDs without consulting your veterinarian, this includes over the counter pet or human aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, etc. Although these medications are incredibly helpful in human medicine, they can cause serious damage and even death in your cat. 

Many **analgesics** are available as well. Many cats do well with tramadol, amantadine, and gabapentin as well as some opioids. Because these medications are made for humans, it can be very difficult to appropriately dose them for small animals like cats. 

There are **alternative therapies** as well. Acupuncture has been shown to decrease chronic and acute pain. Other therapies include magnetic therapy, low level biomodulation therapy (aka laser therapy), stem cell therapy, physical rehabilitation, green muscle lipid supplements, and a few others. 

Depending on the underlying cause of joint pain, surgery may be an option. For example, correcting a luxating patellas or torn cranial cruciate ligament in the knee, or repairing a poor union fracture, etc may significantly improve pain scores in patients. 

### The Take Home Message:

Many, if not most of our feline population is experiencing pain. The sooner we recognize these signs, the quicker we can intervein with non-invasive supplements. Quality of life can be significantly affected while living with joint pain. Help your veterinarian by observing for any of the signs discussed in this article and ask about possible joint disease at your annual wellness visit.
