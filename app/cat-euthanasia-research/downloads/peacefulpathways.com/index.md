I just wanted to take a moment to extend my heartfelt gratitude for the kindness you showed to both me and Salem yesterday. Your patience and understanding were a blessing to us and I am so thankful that you were there to help Salem cross over. Like so many, Salem was such an important part of our lives, and while the decision to allow him to transition was obvious, it was still incredibly difficult. I am so thankful for the gentle people like yourself who make it their life’s work to care for the ones we love most. 

With much appreciation and a very full heart

I wanted to tell you that you made us feel much more comfortable about the whole process. The way you handled everything was very gentle but professional at the same time. Mia deserved to be taken care of with love and respect, which you provided. Thanks again for everything.

Thank you for your help during this difficult time for our family. Bless you for your kindness and services.
