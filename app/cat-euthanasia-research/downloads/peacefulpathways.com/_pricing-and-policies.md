##### Quality of Life Assessment Pricing

**_QUALITY OF LIFE ASSESSMENT_ ($275)**

This type of visit is valuable for families who simply need time and space to address the current quality of life concerns. We will discuss the expected changes that may occur due to your pet’s condition/illness and how to monitor by providing you tools to help arrive more clearly at an end of life decision. We will discuss how the end-of-life process occurs and any questions or concerns you may have related to this topic. We will not discuss in depth your pet’s current medical plan or recommend any adjustments to that. If you would prefer this is discussed, we should instead schedule a **[palliative, hospice care, and pain management](https://peacefulpathways.com/palliative-care/) **visit.

**_QUALITY OF LIFE ASSESSMENT BRIEF/VIRTUAL_ ($95) **

This consultation is helpful for families that need a quick response and would like to have support or confirmation during their decision making process. Dr. Winnick will send her response to you via email typically in 24-48 hours after all the requested videos and information have been received. The consultation is via email and video only. The details will be discussed with you further at the time of scheduling.

**Please note that The American Veterinary Medical Association and the California Board of Veterinary Medicine require a physical examination for a veterinarian to diagnose and treat a medical condition and/or to prescribe medications. Due to this, Dr. Winnick cannot prescribe any medication, or recommend changes to your pet’s medical plan without an in person physical examination.
