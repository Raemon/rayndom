#### Jake

“Oh, aren’t you pretty.” First words I said when I first saw our Jakey. We adopted him through San Martin Animal Shelter at the Petco at El Paseo in 2006, along with his “brother” Bernie. Unfortunately our dear Bern passed in 2013. We felt Jake needed a friend so a few months later we adopted our Teddy. Took a good 6 months for them to get along but they finally became friends though were never as close as Jake & Bernie. Jake was learning to be the alpha. Sadly we lost our Teddy in 2024. Our sweet, dear Jake lived to be approx 20 yrs old (actually closer to 21 we think), outliving both of his friends. Jake was amazing. Loving, smart, made sure we got to bed on time :), a good over-seer of our family. We loved his sweet vocal communications with us and the close bond we shared with him. He is sorely missed but brings us peace knowing he is now free of pain and discomfort and reunited with Teddy and Bernie. Mama & daddy love you forever sweet boy.

#### Milo

Lovely memory of my sweet Milo loved going for a walk, some beautiful sunny days or just sitting on the deck enjoying the sun, you are the best companion I’ve ever had in my life coming home from work and you’re always at the door waiting to greet me loved playing with your toys. Thank you for all the great memories. I will cherish them forever in my heart love Milo.

#### Max

In memory of the most loyal best friend with the fluffiest ears. To my role model on the power of perseverance thru difficult times. Happiest playing outside in younger days, sucking on your squirrel stuffy and in older days sitting by my chair watching TV. I miss you so much my Maximillion! You were one in a million for sure! Sleep in peace my sweet pup.

#### Cookie

I guess you are taking the long view of life here. You couldn’t see very well and you couldn’t hear at all but you loved life anyway. You were the most joyful and happy girl and brought that joy into our lives. I will miss you and love you forever, darling girl  
Love,  
Mom

#### Lulu

In Loving Memory of Our Beloved Companion

Today, we celebrate a cherished member of our family, our beloved Lulu. With heavy hearts, we reflect on the joy and love she brought into our lives during her time with us. It took some time to write this, and I thought, what better day than on her birthday.

Lulu was a humble and kind soul. From the moment I met her, she brought peace into my heart and also those who knew and met her. She came into my life at a time when I thought she needed me, in reality, I needed her. She was the constant that I needed in my life. She was my soul dog but most importantly, the love of my life.

Through the ups and downs of life, Lulu was there—a faithful presence offering solace and companionship. From playful romps to quiet moments of companionship at home, every moment spent with Lulu was a treasure.

Today, as we celebrate what would have been her 15th birthday, we take comfort in knowing that Lulu is at peace, free from pain and discomfort. her spirit will live on in our hearts, a testament to the unconditional love and joy that she brought into our lives.

Rest peacefully, my baby. Thank you for the love, the memories, and the irreplaceable companionship. You will be forever missed and never forgotten.

With love and gratitude,  
Kat & Poppa Johnny

#### Papi

The angel of mercy came and laid my boy down today 8-30-23. This dog came into my life when he was 2 or so. I was his 3rd owner. We spent 11 years together. his first 2 years were filled with abuse and neglect. His last 11 with my unconditional love. As well as you giving me yours. We have made some wonderful memories we have been everywhere together. You made me smile always …. when the filth of the world had me down. You were my light in my own personal darkness.I treated you like royalty because you deserved it. Life will never be the same without you. You were a tremendous watchdog, never destroyed anything, never yappy or goofy. You were the best dog I have ever had, and I have had many. Just being in each other’s presence was enough for us. Your time came up my wonderful dog, when they made you they broke the mold. May you have eternal rest. Until we see each other again. MY BOY MY BOY!! Thanks again to Peaceful Pathways…. the true angels of this world.

#### Lacey

Lacey (2005-2023)  
For the past 18 years, you have been my companion. My friends and family had to gain your trust for you to show up! Every night you would sleep on my chest! I adopted 5 other cats, but none of them were like you! As they say these days, you had the executive presence! You were the queen of the family!  


It was hard to say good bye to you, but Dr Winnick made this event so beautiful that I finally was ok to let you go. Needless to say that your place will be empty and we will always think about you.

#### Obee

She was an old dog battling cancer for 1 year she died peacefully on her favorite blanket we all miss her

#### Mocha

Mocha wandered into our backyard in 2009, an abandoned cat in search of a new home. It wasn’t long before he wandered into our hearts too, especially with our son who was 10 at the time, to become a much-beloved member of our family. Mocha graced our lives for 11 years, and in that time he was a faithful and loving companion, so happy to hop up on a lap and purr as his back was gently stroked, so eager to follow us around the house just to be with us, so content to sunbathe in the window sill. Today we’re grieving his loss, but we’re comforted by believing that somewhere in the beyond Mocha is happy and safe and feeling well again, free of the terrible disease that ended his earthly existence. We also believe that the love we have for him will transmit to him now, and will always keep us connected in a joyful way. We’ll always remember you with love, Mocha.

#### Nala

Nala was my companion and little daemon of 17.5 years. If an animal can be your soulmate, Nala was mine, a force of nature with more presence and personality than most humans. The vet once commented that her strong personality probably kept her going despite her various physical ailments, and I don’t doubt that for one second. Fussy and exacting with a regal air and huge eyes, we nicknamed her Mrs. Queen Owl (QO), and she spent her life ruling and running the household from her soft throne. She chatted with me constantly, demanding brushing and treats, but she was happiest plopped directly on my tummy, where she would rumble like a high-speed motorboat and stick out her pink tongue. She was a lady with crossed paws and a striking white whisker, an upside-down muppet cat, and a rude and ridiculous creature of unknown origins whom a former roommate nicknamed a domestic terrorist. She was also deeply loving. Most telling, these contradictions in her personality didn’t bother her one bit. 

Nala taught me the true meaning of self-acceptance, of how to unapologetically take up space in this world and enjoy the hell out of it, and being her mom was one of the greatest gifts of my life. It would not have been possible to love her more. Rest in peace, my baby.

#### Mojo

I woke up this am and you are not here-for the last 13 years you have woken me up fir your breakfast and walk. My heart aches without you mojo and a part of me is missing. I know you will be running with your pals and no longer in pain. All that knew you thought you were such a handsome boy. Mojo, you have been my kid and brought me more love than I could have expected and a broken bone or two! Life will not be the same without you my big boy! I love and miss you so very much.

#### Mittens

**2002- December 28, 2019.**

Our beloved Mittens has made her journey over the rainbow bridge. Although nothing ever prepares you or eases the loss of a loved one, I take some comfort in knowing that she was surrounded by her loved ones and loved deeply as we said goodbye. We were gifted with seventeen years of her irreplaceable sweet rhythmic purring, demanding meowing, cuddles, sneak attacks, and feistiness. She was the greatest mouse hunter that ever lived. She loved her humans and chose each one of us. I will eternally miss her sweet rubs against my leg every morning and seeing her cat napping or birdwatching infront of our backyard sliding door. Our home has always known her. The loss is great and the grief deep. She is forever in our hearts. Please send prayers and love her way for a beautiful journey. Our sweet and beautiful girl.

#### Kala

**December 6, 2004-September 11, 2019**

My Dearest, Sweet Kala:

There aren’t enough words to adequately express what you meant to me. You were absolutely my earth angel. I’ll never forget the day we met. It was one of the most difficult times of my life and I so desperately needed love and purpose. All your brothers and sisters were playing on the floor but you just came right to my feet and wanted me to pick you up. You sat in my lap that entire visit. It was YOU immediately. You knew what I needed the minute I met you and you never stopped until the last breath you took in my arms. You truly saved me. The things I loved about you and that I’ll miss are endless. I’ll miss the way you’d follow me around the house, I’ll miss you jumping up and down to go for a walk (rain or shine), I’ll miss watching you sunbathe outside, I’ll miss holding your belly as you stick your little head out the car window to let the wind fly through your ears, I’ll miss your tenacity and love for adventure, and how you’d never meet a stranger. I’ll miss your love for life and appreciation for all things big and small. I’ll especially miss your love for me. But most of all Kala, I’ll just miss YOU! You were there through every major event in my life; heartbreak, moves to new places, new jobs, marriage, and of course Kai. And you took it all on, without hesitation. My heart feels broken right now, but I’m going to do my best to live as you did. I will be grateful for breathing in the beautiful air and let the sun shine on my face, I will live life without fear or inhibitions, and I’ll be quick to meet a new friend. You taught me what it was to fully live and love. I’ll do my best to honor you by doing the same. I miss you so much my sweet girl, but I look forward to seeing you in my dreams….until we meet again.

#### Sugar

Sugar has been part of my life for the last 13 years. I still remember the first initial days that I got her from my sisters. She was like a big ball of cotton, all white and fluffy but she wasn’t in the best of health initially. After hand feeding her those first few days, it created an everlasting bond. Every morning for the last 13 years, she woke and jumped out off of my bed and patiently sat and waited for me to get ready. Then she followed me to her own room where she knew she would get fed. Every evening when I got home, she would be waiting for me, lying on top of the couch, which was one of her favorite places, and she would follow me around until I sat down, and that was her cue to jump and sit on my lap. 

Through the years, I seen her grow from a rambunctious kitten, to a very playful, sweet, sometimes annoying, but always loving cat. She will be greatly missed but never forgotten.

#### Fitzgerald Black "Fitzy Poo"

March 2007 - Dec 2012

Born and raised in the South, Fitzy was full of Southern charm but somehow “manners” passed him by. He was a delightful minnis who loved to steal food. He was fast, smooth and fearless when he saw something tasty. Before you knew it – He Ate It ! 

If he was not busy stealing your food like Houdini – he was staring at you while you ate. Fitzy didn’t need words. Anyone would know he was asking ” You gonna eat all that?”

Fitzy would dart out the front door so he could lay in the middle of the street. This delightful activity didn’t make any sense to anyone but him. He had a Pig cookie jar, that held his treats inside. His cookie jar sat on a table by the front door. (it still does)

When the pig head lid was lifted off the body of the cookie jar – the cookie jar would say “I’M A PIG!” with a real country twang. Fitzy would hear “IM A PIG” coming from his cookie jar – and “lickity split” he’d be inside the house, grabbing his chicken jerky from your hand and off he go- skipping to eat it – comfortably on the sofa!

Fitzy was not only a pig with food. He was a real hog in bed. He loved all the covers and most of the pillow. I always looked forward to bed time with Fitzy

At the end of the day Fitzy was imperfect in so many ways – from his tooth to his pirate ways but when He would look at you with his head on your chest, with his little brown eyes looking into yours and His famous snaggle tooth smile – nothing could ever be more perfect.

The life lesson I learned from my pal, Fitzy, Fitzgerald Black is – Be your true you. Your “arf-thentic self” And, your heart and soul will thrive and spill over with love onto those you around you.

I know I certainly soaked him all in! I love you Fitzy so much.

#### Maedbh

Maedbh was, quite simply, the loveliest cat in the world. The softness of her white fur was matched only by her gentle demeanor. At night she often slept on my chest and I would wake to two curious eyes, one pale blue, one golden amber, gazing down at me. She was a silently watchful presence who followed me everywhere, a graceful white shadow. Though occasionally she would burst with love and energy and roll onto her back, chirping and begging for cuddles. And when she slept, curled tightly into a ball, it was impossible not to smile and wonder at her beauty. 

Maedbh’s trust in me never wavered, even when I moved her halfway across the world to Jakarta for two years. In quarantine, terrified and exhausted after a 30 hour plane journey via Amsterdam, she cried out when she heard my voice and purred as soon as I held her. Many people marveled at the expense and hassle I incurred to ship her, but there was no question in my mind that she would go wherever I went.

My darling girl died far too young, at ten years old from lung cancer. At the end she was too weak to move, but would acknowledge me by flicking her tail when I spoke her name. When the time came, she fell asleep in my arms, gazing right into my eyes, devoted and loving to the end. I’m grateful to Dr Winnick for providing her with a peaceful and painless end to her suffering.

Maedbh may be gone but the joy and comfort that she brought to my life will never be forgotten.

#### Jet

Jet 11/11/04 to 12/03/17

Thank you, Jet, for all the love and attention. It was an honor to be your human and I miss having you with me. 

12 and a half years ago you came into our lives when we needed each other. You needed a new home because your first owner decided after having you for four months that they couldn’t keep you. They named you and house trained you but you ate rocks in their yard in Phoenix that had to be surgically removed.

Meanwhile, our decision to get a dog came a couple months after I came home from a trip to Ethiopia. I was in a funk because our community did not feel as warm and loving as Addis Ababa. It was reverse culture shock.

In just a couple days after Justin and I agreed it was time to get a dog, I found you on a website for people interested in Labradoodles and Goldendoodles. Jet, the rock eating Goldendoodle, you were returned to your breeder in Bakersfield and I drove down that weekend to pick you up. You were just 6 months old, only half grown, with one shaved leg from the I.V. you had for your rock removal surgery.

You were such a love, so smart and eager to learn, and I was beside myself with affection and appreciation for you. We went to Saturday puppy classes together, where I learned how to be a good human. I learned that a tired dog is a well-behaved dog, so we spent a lot of time making you tired, taking walks and chasing balls.

You grew into your big paws and you turned heads and melted hearts with your look and your character. You greeted by running up to people, and often by running between our legs and between other people’s legs.

Outside with you, I met more people and the community seemed warmer to me. You didn’t walk. You pranced, proudly carrying your ball with the attached throwing stick. Every day, you let me know how important I was to you and that’s how I saw myself.

Other than out on a walk, you were happiest in our front yard. We didn’t even need to clip you to keep you there. Our enthusiastic greeter, always there when we came home and ready to announce any visitor. Other than occasionally taking medicine, the only thing you ever protested was being separated from us. We decided to give you the best possible care so you would live a long time.

For our family, you were always the thing we could agree on. We all loved you and enjoyed being your humans. You studied us and paid attention to everything we did, like a scientist gathering data, so that you could anticipate our actions. If we wore shoes, you knew we might be willing to take you outside. You always knew when we might have some extra human food for you and you let us know you were there to receive it. You could tell when we were upset.

When you surprised us a couple years ago with heart failure, we thanked science and veterinarians for helping us know how to take care of you and for prescribing pills to keep you going, although with less activity; No more sleeping upstairs with us and no more jumping over the neighbor’s lavender bushes to catch your ball. When you developed arthritis, we got more pills and a strap to help you stand up and took you to Aquadog for swim therapy. We added more rugs to cover the slippery hardwood floor. You couldn’t hear us or get up to greet us, but you still loved to catch a ball and proudly carry it around the block. You really hung in there. Your 13th birthday present was a ramp to help you walk in and out of the front door.

You were the best dog and we told you so when we were all with you in the back yard on December 3, saying goodbye. The last thing you did was what you did best. You let us know you loved and understood us.

#### Reagan

7/5/2004 - 4/16/2018

My sweet Reagan, such a beautiful loving dog who thought he was one of my kids and never really realised he was a dog! You brought nothing but joy and happiness to everyone that crossed your path. I miss and love you with all my heart. Until I see you again my sweet boy, Rae-Rae! Run free my boy!

Xoxo

#### Monsuier

We found him outside of work and fell in love with him right away. His personality was larger than life. He had many characteristics that one would find in a dog. He would always welcome us home when we walked in the house. He could be in that back room and if he heard any kind of rustling in the kitchen that could be perceived as a food product, he would run down the hall in his sideways manner. He ran that way, we believe, due to his cross eyes from his Siamese heritage. He would also appear to be looking to the side of you as you spoke to him due to this trait. When we sat down in our chairs to eat, he always jumped up on the arm rest and pawed at you until he was given some of your food. 

The term Yum Yum was the command that would get him to run to his food. He would run back and forth meowing anytime he had to use the litter box, more than likely to go #2. We have no idea why, but maybe to loosen everything up? LOL. Unfortunately at 15 years of age, he developed Squamous Cell cancer in his jaw and we could see that he was in pain from his actions of pawing his face. This happened so fast within a couple of months and we had to make the heart breaking decision to put him down so that he would not suffer any longer. This type of cancer eats the bone and causes pain and destroys the face. We wanted him to be at peace.

It’s very hard to not walk into any room of our house and not think of Monsuier being in that room. Especially walking into the house and not having him there to greet us. We will miss him and thank him for the love he showed to us every day of his precious life. 

Goodbye D.D./Buddy.

#### Frank

Frank had the forethought to compose his own obituary. I share it in his memory:

If you’re reading this, I am dead. I always wanted to say that but honestly, I didn’t want to actually die- but I digress.

I was born sometime around 2007 in the Pennsylvania countryside. I don’t remember much about that time except despising cats, making getaways, and ending up in doggy prison. Yes, dear reader, I did a stint in the infamous “pound.” I knew I had to get out, but security was tight.

One day, a lady came and walked me. I noticed that she smelled like 2 of my favorite things: the car and cookies. Not wanting to lose this opportunity I jumped into her lap and stared deeply into her eyes. I wanted to make sure that she knew that I had adopted her. Humans, as you may know, are not always that quick.

Thus began the rest of my life. I have traveled across country and for many years was in charge of backyard security. In my retirement I started blogs about “Counter surfing for the vertically challenged”, “Trash can diving for dummies,” and consulted on new grad course topics. It has been a happy and satisfying retirement. In between my interests, trips to the dog park, and long naps I have found that life with my mom is good. And really what more can any dog want?

I am tired now and mom is holding me as I take one final journey. Leaving mom is hard, but we will forever be in each others hearts.

Peace Out, Frank (2007-January 16, 2024)

#### Macey Belle

My Beautiful and passionate cavalier Macey absolutely lit up my life from October 12, 2007 to Jan 23, 2024. She was always by my side through so many poignant times, happy and sad. Macey would fend off squirrels in the yard, climb the hills around us, and shower me with kisses and hugs. The “caboose” of all of my fur-babies, her unconditional love and spirit will be alive in my heart forever. Rest peacefully my little love.

#### Bailey

My lil Bailey was my first dog aka fur baby. He was such an amazing doggie. He would do this lil dance every time he got excited 😊 he trained me when he had to go potty. He LOVED attention and belly rubs. He was my best friend, my therapist and my snuggle buddy to watch the with. He was my dog but the entire family loved him as their own. He is missed every moment of the day. But I know he’s no longer in pain and can see the birdies and hear the wind blowing on his face, I hope you’re basking in the sun and doing your happy dance. Until we see each other again poopies! I love Bailey!

#### Juve

Our girl Juve has crossed over the rainbow bridge to rest. Paid her dues on this Earth. Born on the streets in Bahrain, she survived her first few years hunting on the streets and with the mercy of a woman who would feed her. She spent the next 6 years with a full belly, a warm bed inside and with a family that loves her. She enjoyed laying in the sun and watching the fence line. She left us sooner than we would have liked. We miss her every day, but we remember her strength and grace. Truly an honor to have shared part of this life experience with her. See you later Juve. We love you.

#### Peanut

Our companion for almost 14 years, after we rescued her at around one and half years old in December of 2006. But as the saying goes…she rescued us! 

She had countless personalized songs and nick names like “moose moose”, “tine tine”, “baby dog,” “little alien” and most commonly “Piggy” because she was always working her magic to get us to give her human food. Her personality was soft, shy, compassionate and yet stubborn. She adapted to the environment and mood around her.

She knew both my husband and I and gave us love according to what we needed. She knew that Papa (my husband) just needed to have her in his arms to comfort him. She loved to be attached to his left arm like a Koala when we were out in public and then held up by his right arm as she had her head out the window on our car rides. She loved those car rides!! For Mama she would lick my nose and face to say she loved me and she would lick my tears if I was crying.

My husband had a number of dogs when he was growing up, but he often told me that none of them were like Peanut. She was my first dog, and I honestly don’t know how I made it this far in life without a dog. My friends and family know I called her “the love of my life,” which didn’t always thrill my husband of 19 years to hear..lol.

We made the decision to create a huge Thanksgiving feast in her honor with her favorite food CHICKEN!! During our celebration we read a number of lessons we learned from Peanut over the years. That was beautiful. We know that Peanut completed her mission in our lives by showing us how to be united. She did not let pride, upset, what other thought or said get in the way of demonstrating her unconditional love for us. We are forever thankful for her and we know her Angel is with us forever. We hope to be better people from all we have learned from her.

#### Daisy

Our precious baby Daisy was the joy of our lives. We rescued her when she was nine weeks old and she was the center of our world for 16 years. Daisy was my absolute best friend and loyal companion. It’s hard to sleep without her snuggling up against one of us. Everything reminds us of the deep loss we feel when Daisy isn’t in her usual places in the house.

Daisy we love you and miss you more than you could ever know. Enjoy heaven where we know you can see, hear, and run around again. Although I cry every day missing you I look forward to seeing you again one day. Thank you for being our precious baby.

#### Indica

Indica was my first dog & I still remember her first car ride home with me at 10 weeks old, she threw up in the car lol. I also remember her climbing onto the couch that first night & proceeding to snore, something she would do for the next 13 or so years as a part of me & family’s lives. She loved me unconditionally, even when things were not perfect & I made mistakes. I will always remember her & I consider it one of the greatest accomplishments in my life to have given her the good & long life that she had. I cannot thank Peaceful Pathways & Dr. Winnick enough for their part in giving Indica the best life she could have had, until her final day.

#### Chispita

It was most definitely love at first sight. From the very moment we met, you rolled onto your back, showed me your belly and trusted me completely, both with your heart and with your life. You taught me to have more gentleness and compassion in a way no other creature has. You greeted me with howls, smiles and wags every time I came home. You watched the girls grow up and you were there when each of us struggled in tough moments, when the tears flowed and when everything fell apart, you never judged me. Instead you walked beside me for miles, me never leaving my side, just as I had always promised to never leave yours. I will miss your snoring that soothed me to sleep each night. I will miss the pitter patter of your feet on the hardwood floors. I will miss the sound of you tapping your nails on the glass when you wanted to come in or out. I will miss the sound of your scratching on my bedroom door because you wanted to be close to me. I will miss the way you would sit with your leg out to the side and your head tilted every so slightly. I will miss the pull of the leash because there was something you desperately wanted to sniff on our walks. I will miss the way you would do a twirl when I set your breakfast down each morning. I will miss the smart spots above your eyes and the way you would look at me from the side when I would tell you that “you are a very good girl”. I will miss the way you would sneeze and snort when I was eating and how eager you were for me to share my meal with you. I will miss how you only had to meet someone once to be excited to see them a second time and how you remembered and accepted everyone. I will miss the way you would sit by the bed when you knew I was waking up and the sound of your tail wagging against the floor because you were excited for another meal, another day, another moment. I will miss how you would always appear in whatever room I was in around 5pm to remind me that it was dinner time. I will miss the walks we went on and the routines we shared. I will miss all of you, my sweet girl. Thank you for being my most true uncomplicated love. Your soul and your spirit are so perfectly and beautifully aligned. I am forever grateful to have been your friend and guardian in this life ♥️

You are always in our thoughts.

Enjoy all the steak heaven can supply.

#### Sierra

In Loving Memory of Sierra 2005 – 2020

Sierra was born into a litter of 11 and was clearly the smartest and most beautiful pup of her litter. She was always alert and ahead of anything going on. Sierra loved the water and would dive into a lake, pool, or river without any hesitation. She was a good hiker. She also “smiled” when happy. She loved her treats and biscuits and had the softest ears and belly. Sierra was always ready to go on a walk, and “pranced,” jumping up and down, at every intersection, anxious to cross. Her prancing continued to the end, before eating, before walking, or whenever excited.

Sierra liked to climb trees and pick growing apples and fruit, climbing well over seven feet above the ground. She used to then take the unripe fruit and hoard it under a bed. Sierra also liked to eat tomatoes and picked berries off bushes. She liked to share carrots with her pony friend Indian.

Sierra loved fetching the ball or her “bunny” and also dragging huge sticks on hikes. She loved rubbing her sides against the wall of the long hallway in Sara’s house, leaving dirty streaks in her wake. Sierra was fiercely loyal and protective of her home and loved people.

To compensate for her wonders, Sierra disliked going in the car and most other dogs.

Sierra had 2 good homes with 2 good moms. Sierra, you were a joy and comfort. You will be missed and thank you for sharing your lives with us.

#### Dexter

Dexter, our sweet boy. Saying goodbye to you was so hard and yet we knew it was the kindest choice we could make. We know you have gotten your angel wings and are no longer hampered by your illness. We are sure you have met up with your buddy, Milo, and he is showing you the ropes as he did in life. May you occupy your days running, chasing, and howling that wonderful AAROOO until we all meet up again.

#### Max

Max was our family pet, loyal friend and best pal for 13 years. We will all miss you so much. Gone but not forgotten pal. We love you. A special thank you to Peaceful Pathways for making our life change as easy as possible.

#### Jean-Claude

Jean-Claude was a very loving and intelligent cat. If he didn’t get what he wanted at first, he would persist. And persist. When he was young, this small ball of yellow fur won me over by always demanding affection and attention. He started out as a shy cat, but in his older days, he came out of his shell and had his last hurrah at a gathering of friends, where he socialized with each and every one of them. 

Jean-Claude was also extremely agile and could, until his last two years, jump over six feet to the tops of my armoire and closets. At over eighteen years, he was long-lived for an outdoor cat who roamed the roofs and trellis, always on the lookout for a mouse to bring back home. He will always be in my thoughts and will be hard to replace.

#### The Pie

The Pie was named after Farmer Ede’s naughty black and white horse who kept jumping out of his field and running amok down the village street in the book, National Velvet. Like his equine namesake, The Pie was an adorably naughty, quirky, special, loving, infamous cat. At one point tipping the scales at 22 pounds, our Pie was the terror of the local vet hospital and an enemy to pet sitters who neglected to bring him offerings of turkey deli meat, but he was always a gentle pussycat with us. 

The Pie loved to carry soft toys or used dryer sheets around the house in his mouth while yowling mournfully, especially in the middle of the night. He was a garbage can raiding, plate cleaning, front door greeting, UPS guy scaring, paw curling, rubber band biting, cheese eating, treat ball rolling, catmint chewing, physical powerhouse who delighted in jumping the six-foot fence around our garden simply to roll around on the concrete surface on the other side. And Pie was lightning fast … one time leaping up to successfully catch a hummingbird in mid-flight. The Pie was never a lap cat but was always lovingly affectionate, choosing to hang out with his people while contentedly purring and kneading his paws, enthusiastically “stomping grapes” on a nearby blanket.

We will always love our unique, handsome boy Pie and his sweet sister Thomasina, and we will miss them for the rest of our lives. Thomasina passed peacefully in my arms from cancer just before their 17th birthday, but we are so blessed that Dr. Winnick was there to gently release The Pie from his failing body one month later, to be reunited with Thomasina and his other feline friend Thistle. There was such strength in The Pie’s sweetness … so much so that our valiant boy needed help for a peaceful transition despite being so gravely ill.

How lucky we were to be chosen by these special cats when they were such tiny kittens! And how grateful we are to have enjoyed the privilege of loving them for so many happy years. Their love will forever shine its light into our hearts.

#### Harley

I will forever miss him, and still miss him till this day. I miss him in the kitchen “waoing” for food, he was always the chubby one and had the most beautiful eyes that i have ever seen. He is missed very much and always will be part of our “Necessitos 5” Family.

#### Stutz

October 16, 2001 – August 2, 2015

Stutz Bearcat started his professional show career at 6 months of age by winning Best of Breed. He won several other championships, including another Best of Breed at 9 months. He sired a litter of puppies and was also featured in several Cardigan Welch Corgi calendars. 

He got too big to continue to compete, and he moved from Florida to California to retire. We adopted him in February 2005. We often joke how quickly we turned him from a champ to a chump, since he adapted to our family, especially the couch, so quickly. He and Graycie, our kitten, quickly became good friends although she has always held the position of alpha dog in the household.

Stutz loved being a part of our family, especially the car rides and going to the softball fields to romp in the grass and meet with all the kids. He was a devout “foodie” and would appear instantly to sample whatever was being prepared. He was very protective of all of his family, but especially his Mommy who he followed around everywhere. Stutz enjoyed going to Tahoe with the gang and did a good job of staking out his territory. He liked it when we had parties because he would get to socialize – the extra food was always a bonus.

Stutz was diagnosed with several types of cancer a few months ago and passed away today. He had a wonderful life and he was the nicest, gentlest dog ever. We thank him for all the love he gave us and the many laughs we have had together. Stutz will be forever missed by us all.

#### Sierra-Belle

Sierra-Belle 4/2006 - 7/2013

My sweet sweet Sierra. She was truly a one of kind! Life will never be the same without her with us. She was the best dog we could have ever had. Perfect beyond imagine. I only wish she hadn’t left us so soon. Sierra was incredibly kind, gentle, and loving. She absolutely loved working in the barn with me and tagging along on trail rides, chasing balls and swimming in the pond. This dog could do no wrong. She will always hold a very large special place in my heart. I miss her dearly.

#### Sir Winston McArthur

**Obituary: A Letter from Sir Winston McArthur, the Space Dog**

Dear friends, family, and fellow earthlings,

If you are reading this, my rocket ship has already launched into the next dimension. Fret not, homo sapiens; my departure from this earthly realm was filled with tender devotion, tranquility, and peace. I was surrounded by the unwavering love and affection of my pawrents, as well as my feline sisters, Luna and Lucy Maude.

With my spirit as bright as the stars, I hopped aboard my very own rocket ship on January 4th, 2025. I am sure you are all wondering about my rocket ship… Let me tell you, it is a one-of-a-kind, marvelous contraption crafted from the boundless love, laughter, adventures, and beautiful memories my family and I shared on our journey together. As the countdown began, I felt the familiar warmth of my momma’s embrace, the soothing rhythm of her heartbeat, her loving touch on my head, and her soft kisses on my face. It filled me with immeasurable joy as I realized this new adventure was not one of sadness but of celebration.

For those of you who knew me best, I was more than just a dog; I was my momma’s steadfast co-pilot, her furry confidant, and the guardian of her dreams. Not too long after my already amazing life with momma began, she introduced me to a man who would ultimately become my dad. Fun fact: the day that my momma met my dad, I was there wearing a beautiful satin bow tie… I like to take credit for their meeting! Together with momma and pops, we explored the many wonders of our earthly galaxy, soaring through countless adventures like rocket fuel propelling us into the stratosphere of fun. I went camping in Death Valley, hiked to Angel’s Landing in Zion National Park (hidden in my pops’ backpack while my pawrents greeted park rangers), played in the snow in Yosemite, and dug endlessly in the sand and splashed in the ocean in Carmel. I also promoted positive messages on Instagram through Winston’s Wisdom Wednesdays… I had fans from all over the world! My mission in life was simple: to make everybody I encountered happy, but most importantly, my momma. With every slobbery kiss, I aimed to launch her into a universe of happiness. If I could have sent her to the moon just to see her face light up, I would have boldly gone where no dog has gone before.

Now, I take to the cosmos, with stars twinkling against the infinite backdrop of the universe, guided by the invisible leash of love that will always tie us together. Though my paws may no longer touch the ground, and our sofa naps will be a joyful memory, my spirit will forever run alongside my pawrents. So, mom and dad, look up into the night sky and know that I am that twinkling star guiding you, waiting for the day we reunite in the sky.

Let this not be a farewell but a celebration of the adventures we shared—the belly rubs, the good times, and the endless love that stretched across every mile we journeyed together. Remember that I’ll always be your brave little astronaut, exploring infinity and beyond. So, lift your head high, my dear friends, and let love orbit around you, for I have launched into a new chapter, forever grateful for the earthbound adventures we shared. Sending an extra dose of love to my best friend forever, Valentina – I love you infinitely.

With all my love and Frenchie kisses,

Over and Out,

Sir Winston McArthur ✨🐾🚀  
12/3/2009 – 1/4/2025

#### Teddy

Teddy was my constant, loving companion/shadow for 17-1/2 years. He had to be near me at all times! I don’t remember what it was like without him. There is such a void in my heart and home without him. I miss him terribly. I know he is now with Mattie, Grav, Abby, Tucker and Pete and is waiting for me some day. 🌈 ❤️‍🩹

💙Teddy Fox 12/12/05 – 06/23/23💙

#### Krissy

From the day I brought you home when I was just a child and you a pup, you’ve been a constant in my life. You were there for many of my milestones – finishing elementary school, graduating high school, and even graduating college and getting my first career job. I could depend on you to be there with me for every meal and adventure (especially if there were squirrels to terrorize). You have taught me so many life lessons and became a part of my identity. For the past 13 years, I have loved you to bits and today I honor your memory. I know that now you can freely run and roll on every acre of fresh grass, indulge in all the treats you want, and take the greatest naps.

Thank you for choosing me to be your human, you were my greatest gift.

#### Pepe

My sweet boy Pepito I will never forget you. I love you so much and I am gonna miss you deeply😥

#### JoJo

My dearest JoJo, you were my first dog, a wish-come-true since I was a little girl, the dog that changed my life. Without you, I wouldn’t have met your Dad, and my life would have been completely different. Thank you for the most amazing 16 (almost 17!) years. Your presence is greatly missed, but we know you are in a better place now, free of any pain, reunited with your brother Bart. We will see you again one day until then you will forever be in our hearts.

#### Gracie

In Loving Memory of Gracie.

#### Whiskey

Whiskey was the “cat I never asked for,” and he was a bit of a terror as a kitten (tearing up plants, pouncing me in the night, etc.) But, as he got older, Whiskey was the most communicative, interactive and affectionate cat imaginable. He spoke and asked for things, “nursed” me sweetly when I was ill (complete with kisses and pats on the face), and was incredibly cuddly. Every morning for 10 years, I woke up intertwined with Whiskey in my arms, around my head and neck. He also bathed and cuddled my other cat, Ramona, who was very attached to him. When it was time to say “good-bye” to Whiskey, I was devastated. The only consolation was to have a peaceful passing at home. I would not have wanted it any other way – and would want the same for myself. Whiskey was greatly loved and will be greatly missed.

#### Augie

It was pretty much love at first sight with Augie. She chose me 15 years ago as much as I did her. I feel so blessed that she chose to share her deep love, her joy, her forever and always puppy-ness, her vibrant life up here on the hill. Her heart always open, always playful and always singing. Yes Augie, my dear dear friend, you taught me a great deal, there are hardly any words that come close to expressing how much you will be missed.

#### Millenium (Mill)

In memory of Millenium (Mill), June 15, 2013

I picked my human, Heather, just before the millennium and had 14 wonderful years with her. She named me after the TV show that was on at the time. 

Some of the things that I enjoyed in my days with her were: sleeping on top of her at night before crawling up to her chest and neck at 3 AM to purr very loudly for attention. I also really loved when she would scratch my stomach for hours until I would finally get frisky and grab her hand as well as gently biting at times. And don’t forget climbing on the bannister of the Franklin house or in my younger days batting around the stuffed mice that I was given.

I spent many wonderful hours on her lap as she studied for her engineering degree.

The huntress in me was an expert at hunting and catching birds, mice and the occasional squirrel. Some of the birds I would bring into the house to the surprise of my human, who would then chase it out of the house. A waste of effort, if you asked me.

When my human took me to California, I became much wiser and spent my time indoors where I could run rule of the house. The chair was mine. The bed was mine. The floor was mine. Simply put, I was the queen and ruler of the house .

By the end, I had pretty much anything any cat could want and wouldn’t have asked for anything different. Thank you, my human, for taking such good and loving care of me during my time with you.

Mill

You will be sorely missed Mill, the greatest cat that could have ever been in my life. Thank you for all the great memories. Love Heather

#### Fred

In loving memory of my best friend in the whole wide world. I love you so much, and there isn’t a moment that goes by where I am not missing you terribly. Thank you so much for being by my side through the best and worst of times. Thank you for seeing me through my rough 20’s. I will never ever forget you, my “forever dog” and sincerely hope that I get to experience your amazing presence again someday. Love always and forever, Kavita. PS: Thank you so much, Dr. Winnick, for taking care of this so beautifully and mindfully in our home. We are forever grateful.

#### Precious

July 2015

When I rescued her at the vet’s office 18 years ago, he asked/warned, “Are you sure you want that one? She’s a little scrappy.” I was sure and we have been in love ever since, scrappiness and all. She was my greatest love, teacher, friend and soul mate. Here are some of her favorite things: she suckled on my ear lobes as a kitten, licked tears from my cheeks, snuggled and cuddled endlessly, followed the sun for warm naps, chewed on plastic and wrapping paper, greeted me when I pulled my car in to the driveway at the end of each day, sat on my head and patted my cheeks- gently- to wake me, chased anything that moved, brought me piles of leaves from outside with two little teeth marks in each one, adopted David when he and I met and loved him fiercely, too………. 

She was sick for 2.5 years, and was ultimately released July 3, coinciding with Independence day and freedom. Saying goodbye was heart wrenching and required great courage.

Dr. Jenn was our angel vet who helped us to be brave, grieve, and say goodbye to our precious Precious baby girl cat. Now when I look for her, I go to my heart, where she will always live. Pure love.

#### Marli

In loving memory of my gorgeous and highly sensitive soul dog, Marli. As the most empathic being I have ever known, you understood the world at a much deeper level than most. I miss saying, “I’m gonna get you, I’m gonna get you, I GOT YOU!!” and hearing you howl beautifully on “YOU!!” 🙂 I miss singing songs and randomly inserting your name, and hearing you sing with delight upon hearing your name. You had the most beautiful singing voice and the biggest heart. Thank you, my love, for being there for me through the best and worst of times. I love you forever.

#### Coco

2010 - 2018

My sweet and brave doggie, Coco passed away on June 28, 2018. 

She was surrounded by her human family and doggie sister, Daisy while lying on her favorite spot on the coach at home.

I want to remember the first time we met at Peninsula SPCA where I reluctantly adopted her because I was still missing my recently departed dog, Brandy. When we took her home, she was still recovering from kennel cough and her first night, she snored which I would eventually get used to. After bonding with our other dog, Daisy and my Mom and sisters and myself, Coco became part of the family.

Coco had a good apetite even during her last months, she still ate a platefull of chicken or beef then afer eatting she would hop on the coach and wipe her face clean. Other traits..waiting patiently in the kitchen hallway to be fed or getting her harness put on for walks or going for a ride. She’d hop in the car then hop on on small perch next to car’s back window or sit on my lap with her head poking out the window. Even while sick with cancer and a heart murmur, she would still use the pp pads and hop up/down the porch stairs to relieve herself outside. Such a Good Girl !

She would sit on top of coach looking out the window or greeting me or my sisters with a toy in her mouth. I will miss her loud snores that lulled me to sleep, her soulful gaze, stroking her silky hair or giving her belly rubs, scratching the door to be let in/out and her signature Coco-kisses.

Rest in peace my faithful companion. We were Blessed to have you in our lives.

Love you,

Mom

#### Tara

Tara was one of the best dogs in the world, at least in my opinion and many oithers. So there really is so much I could say about her. She was caring, loving, protective, obedient, smart, energetic, and the best cuddler. She loved the beach and going on long walks. Tara loved balls and loved playing fetch. She would really make you work hard to get the ball back from her once she caught it. She would carry her ball or chew everywhere.She loved to chew on rawhides, bully sticks, and stuffed animals. Tara was a loving and loyal companion to my husband and I. She will forever be missed and I can’t wait until the day that we will all be reunited with one another again, Rest in Paradise my pretty girl Tara. We love you so much forever and always.

#### Jada

#### Chaucer

Chaucer 3-3-00 ~ 9-26-16

The best cat in the entire world. He had beautiful little white paws, white soft chest, and Maine Coon tufts in his ears. You would swear he wore eyeliner. He was my best buddy who kept me company in my home office. He understood conference calls and when I hung up the phone it was time to play., be fed or let onto the deck. We had our own secret communication. He is missed.

#### Jet

In memory of Jet, 2005(?)-2015

Sweet baby Jet, my little Jetski, I miss you so very much. Every single moment of the 8 years I spent with you was precious, from the day I brought you home from the shelter to the day Dr. Winnick so mercifully helped free you from pain and future suffering. I loved your black, silky coat, your small, neat paws, your effortless leaps, your playfulness, your high voice, the way you enjoyed flowers, your beautiful, all-seeing eyes staring into mine. Slow blinks Id give you back, to reassure you that all was well. You were aware of every tiny change in your environment–so sensitive and emotional. You loved your big brother Kuro and followed him everywhere. I hope you are with him even now. Thank you for your devotion, your trust, your love, your sweet, shy, affectionate nature. I love you always. Rest in peace, sweet Jet.

#### Kuro

In memory of Kuro, 2000(?)-2015

Beautiful boy, lovely black lion, darling Kuro, I miss you in countless ways. Every single morning of all our many years together, waking up to you climbing on to my chest, settling your heavy, big-boned body comfortably, and purring. My warm, sweet, reliable 5 a.m. wake-up call. I so admired your loving, sociable, talkative, confident nature, your regal bearing and stately dignity, your affection for your little brother Jet. I hope you are with Jet still. Kuro, my big, furry sweetheart, thank you for your love and companionship, your affection and loyalty, your big heart, your patience, and your strength. Everyone who met you adored you. Thank you, Dr. Winnick, for giving Kuro a truly peaceful passing. You are freed from pain and illness, dearest Kuro. I love you always. Rest in peace.
