#### Dr. Jenn Winnick, DVM, CHPV

Certified Animal Hospice and Palliative Care Veterinarian

Dr. Jenn Winnick grew up surrounded by animals – from dogs and cats to hamsters and horses. Inspired by the constant, unconditional love they gave, she began a journey culminating when she received her veterinary degree from the University of Georgia College of Veterinary Medicine.

In the fall of 2011, Dr. Winnick said good-bye to Kelley, her best friend, and confidant of thirteen years. Kelley was a remarkable companion. Present through all the ups and downs of life, relationships, veterinary school, and post-graduate training; she was always there offering unconditional love. It was an honor to be able to help her best friend pass in the comfort of her own home, surrounded by loved ones and familiar surroundings.

Having the personal experience of going through all the challenges of end of life care and finally euthanasia for Kelley, Dr. Winnick has a unique understanding for the difficulties and struggles of both her patients and owners during this time of life transition. Wanting to help ease the anxieties for all and make the end of life transition a peaceful and comfortable experience, Dr. Winnick started Peaceful Pathways in 2011.

Dr. Winnick is a member of the American Veterinary Medical Association, the International Association of Animal Hospice and Palliative Care, the Association for Pet Loss and Bereavement, and the International Association of Veterinary Pain Management. In October 2017, she was among the first veterinarians in the world to become certified in animal hospice and palliative care, earning her the title CHPV. Currently, her family consists of Luna, her 12-year-old calico kitty and Kota her 2 year Pit/Boxer rescue.

**Care Provided** ~ Dr. Winnick provides Palliative Medicine/Hospice/Senior Care and Pain Management and In-Home Euthanasia appointments for dogs and cats, rabbits, pockets pets, and birds. She is also available for Quality of Life consultations.
