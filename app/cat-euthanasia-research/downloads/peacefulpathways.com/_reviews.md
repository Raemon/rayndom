Dr. Winnick was very efficient, the process was fast, patient when needed. She was perfect, altough we still miss our 17 years old darling Pasha. Pasha passed without knowing what was happening. I highly recommend and thank Dr. Winnick.

Joelle C.

Dear Dr. Winnick, Amy, Cecilian, and Jenica,

As you know, I was very conflicted in the weeks leading up to Glory’s last day and am calmed both by the feeling that it was time and we gave her as good an end as one could. I have been meaning to write to you to thank you for making Glory’s transition as gentle as it possibly could be. You were very true to your clinic’s name. I’ve been telling friends and family that the experience for her was as free of drama and anxiety as I could have hoped for. An unexpected moment of gentle respect that affected me was the way Dr. Winnick handled Glory on the stretcher. The act of putting her head on a pillow and tucking her in made the experience feel like she was taking a cozy nap. I remember leaving our previous dog laying lifeless on the cold floor of the vet’s office at the end of her life and am so grateful that instead we gave Glory a kiss on the head as she was bundled up and sent her off.

With deep gratitude,

We are so grateful that Dr. Winnick could come to our house. She made a very difficult event so much easier and calmer. Dylan was relaxed in our back yard and the whole activity was very peaceful. Dr. Winnick was caring and compassionate during the whole process. We highly recommend Peaceful Pathways.

Stephen L.

Could not have asked for a more peaceful and dignified experience when Dr Jenn Winnick came to our home to euthanize our beloved dog Lucy.

Gerry K.

I want to thank Dr. Winnick and the Peaceful Pathways staff from the bottom of my heart. The whole process was seamless from beginning to the end. I put an inquiry at 10pm, not thinking I’d get an appointment for at least a 1-2 days. My dog, Toby declined quickly and I was taking a chance on seeing if they could squeeze me in the following day. I no longer wanted Toby to suffer and didn’t want to stress him out going to an ER vet. I got a text at 7:45am the following morning stating they received my inquiry and will be calling me around 8-8:30. The lady who set everything up for me was so sweet. Dr. Winnick texted me shortly after and came right at my appointment time. She was very sweet, explained the whole process to my family and I and gave us as much time as we needed with my baby Toby. Although this was the first time meeting her, it felt like she has cared for Toby before and was very comforting, warm and welcoming. I highly recommend end of life procedures with Dr. Winnick and peaceful pathways. Thank you to you and your team again.

Danielle B.

My 10 year old pup had been struggling for a few weeks. It was clear he was in pain and was ready to be done with treatments and to just be at peace. The days leading up to the decision to move forward with at home euthanasia were, well, torture. So many conflicting emotions about not saying goodbye too soon or too late. 

I reached out to Dr. Jenn Winnick over the weekend for a Pet Assessment. Even though she was closed and didn’t work Sunday’s, she responded immediately. She reviewed his medical records in detail as well as the videos I submitted and replied with a detailed compassionate assessment. This helped bring everything into focus and help me make the most caring decision to move forward with Murphy’s goodbye. I have unfortunately had to euthanize my last dog and was present for an at home euthanasia with my parents. My last dog was in the ICU and I had to say goodbye in the hospital. It was traumatic, he was anxious and scared during the procedure. For my parents dog the at home provider wasn’t very compassionate and it left emotional scars on the family as a result. What I can tell you with absolute certainty is how loving and compassionate Dr. Jenn Winnick is throughout the process. She was loving on Murphy, gave us as much time as we needed to be with him and gave us space to grieve once he had passed. Deciding to euthanize is a difficult decision but it is the kindest gift you can give your loved one when the time comes. 

Peaceful Pathways was amazing during this difficult time and I cannot thank Dr. Winnick enough for how she handled everything.

Pete C.

In the unfortunate circumstance that you need to put a beloved pet down you couldnt find a more professional, caring and empathetic organization. I had to put down two of my dear boys within a year and used peaceful pathways both times and i cant say enough good things about their services!

Kevin Y.

Almost 2 weeks now since I had to say goodbye to my sweet Kenzie, a yellow lab that almost made it to her 16th birthday. Having had this experience with many pets in the past I knew how hard it was, but this one was particularly painful. Kenzie was always my true and loyal companion, and especially in the past few years as our family has gone thru several difficult losses. I was very fortunate to have Dr. Winnick come to my house within a few hours of my call to the office. It’s hard to describe how compassionate, respectful, patient and kind that she was, knowing how painful this was for me. She gave me all the time I needed, and when I was ready to let her go, she helped Kenzie move on so peacefully and quietly. I can’t thank you enough, Dr. Winnick, for your kindness and clear understanding of my feelings. Thank you, thank you.

Jamie H.

Thank you for your kind thoughts. Cecilian for her kindness and her aid in arranging Dr. Winnick’s very timely visit. And Dr Winnick was a marvel. She was wonderful, her patience and her tenderness with Riley made an awful situation bearable. Riley was suffering and she brought him a peaceful and merciful end. Thank you all for providing a service so necessary and for bringing peace of mind to us.

Bill.

It took some time for me to write this review but I just wanted to express my gratitude to Dr. Winnick. I found Dr. Winnick on google, I had searched and read through many other websites for hours but hers stood out to me. Something just told me she was a kind person, who truly felt what her clients are going through. Thank you for your kindness from the moment we got on the phone to the very last minute we had with Lulu. Your compassion and patience we greatly appreciate.

Katherine U.

We cannot thank you enough for your care and compassion upon Martini’s passing. As you can imagine, it was a tough decision on our part but we knew it was the right decision. Having a professional (Dr. Winnick) in our home (who we also appreciated for her kindness and respect for our dog), answering our questions, and listening to our stories about our beloved Martini, made it so much easier. We couldn’t have asked for more! Thank you again so muich.

Chuck A.

I can’t say enough about the care and compassion we received from Dr. Jen and the phone counselor I spoke with in arranging to say goodbye to our sweet Baby Louie. The decision is agonizing, but they helped us so much at every step of the process. They fit us in to their schedule to allow us to say goodbye to Lou when he needed us to. I believe it was so comforting for Louie to be at home and to have his moms and his fur friends around as he made his transition. Dr. Jen was thorough in her explanation. She was so patient and gave us time at each step to discuss and process as fully as possible. The process was smooth and seemed painless, and he passed peacefully. Afterward, Dr. Jen had a comfortable and welcoming place set up to transport him on to his resting place. This part of the journey with pets is very hard, but unavoidable. Dr. Jen and Peaceful Pathways made it a positive experience for us, and we are very grateful for them.

Tere C.

Thank you very much for this. I really cannot overstate how much we appreciate what you do. It means the world to us that Doc was able to pass away peacefully at home without fear or anxiety.

O.B.

Thank you Dr. Jenn Winnick, for coming to our rescue when we had to say goodbye to our precious Macey Belle. You cared as much for us as for Macey, you were kind, gentle, patient and respectful, and gave us precious time with Macey, taking everything at our pace and hers. Because of your expertise and care, Macey passed ever so peacefully with no distress. My heart is in anguish, but I know we helped Macey pass with dignity and comfort because of you. I am forever filled with gratitude. You touch many lives with the work you do, and it is so very important. Thank you so much!

Dan & Marie & Macey

Thank you for making his transition so calm and smooth. It allowed me full closure.

Susan G.

Peaceful Pathways was truly amazing from the swift response and how compassionate they are on the phone. Amy you are a beautiful soul and you are truly amazing at your job. Dr. Winnick is truly an angel! She was so empathic and was extremely patient and understanding through the entire process. My Bailey hated the vets so to be able to have go on his journey in his favorite doughnut bed was the perfect send off for him. Thank you Peaceful Pathways for all that do!

Kristina Z.

When it was time to put our beloved Baloo to sleep, we were blessed to meet Dr. Winnick. Dr. Winnick came to our home and prepared us for the procedure; she was kind, patient, and empathetic. Dr. Winnick made a very painful and emotional situation as comforting as possible. When the time comes for our 19-year-old dog, we will definitely call Dr. Winnick. I highly recommend Dr. Winnick of Peaceful Pathways.

Vickie B.

Dr. Winnick and her staff made a sad and difficult time so much easier for my family. Everyone who was present for our dog’s farewell was so pleased and grateful. Dr. Winnick is very empathetic, professional and kind, and she explained everything to us in such a thorough and sensitive way. Every single aspect of this experience was so positive and I love that we will all look back on our beloved Phoebus’ last day with peace and gratitude. Thank you so much for everything!

Laurel B.

Dr. Winnick is truly an angel on Earth. She helped my mom say goodbye to her beloved cat with compassion, patience, and understanding. I can not say enough kind words about Dr. Winnick and Peaceful Pathways.

Sonja H.

Thank you Dr. Winnick for being so kind, patient, empathetic and caring during the most difficult time of our lives. Our Daisy was truly our baby and having to say goodbye to her was devastating. Thank you for making sure Daisy didn’t feel any discomfort. Her passing was peaceful and painless and Daisy felt safe next to her mommy and daddy while resting on the couch. I would 100% recommend Dr. Winnick for anyone facing this heartbreaking situation with their beloved pet.

Sonja C.

Thank you so much for helping us with Maggie. Your accurate and honest analysis helped us make the right decision for her. It was so hard to let her go, but your kindness and compassion throughout the whole process made it a little easier. I wanted her to go peacefully surrounded by family, friends and her precious toys and you made that possible. My sincere gratitude.

Liliane P.

Dr. Winnick and her team at Peaceful Pathways are sincere and compassionate caregivers. Their veterinary expertise, innate kindness, and careful support made the most difficult process something we could manage and process. Their services are a gift to all pet owners. Thanks to Dr. Winnick, we were able to give our beloved pet a peaceful, humane, and loving farewell. I will never forget Dr. Winnick’s quiet understanding and gentle care. It made such a difference to our entire family.

Karen B.

I wouldn’t have wanted to do this any other than with Dr.Winnick. There’s not much more I can say to add to all the other reviews. She is everything everyone mentions and we are grateful she was there for us to help with this transition. I feel like Dr.Winnick is forever a part of the journey with our girl, Juve. Thank you for treating Juve with respect in the end.

Juve's Parents

I want to say that I’m very grateful to Dr. Winnick, she was very compassionate and gentle with my Gemmie. Her kindness, soft manner, and patience helped me a lot to let my Gemmie’s transition to a resting place. Forever grateful 🌹🙏

Gemmie's Family

There are not enough words to explain just how kind, caring, and patient Dr. Jen was with our special boy and our family. Making the arrangements was friendly and uncomplicated. The office was wonderful about answering so many questions. She treated our dying heart dog with such kindness and respect even after he was gone. Thank you.

Hugo's Family

Dr. Winnick is such an angel. Calm, respectful, and gentle. Her thoughts on Eden reassured me that it was time to let her go. Everything was explained thoroughly and clearly. I’ve already recommended Peaceful Pathways to a friend and will continue to recommend her in the future. Through this experience, I found not only had I used Dr. Winnick previously but so had 2 others. Thank you again, Dr. Winnick, for taking such good care of all of us 2 and 4 legged beings.

Jenn K.

May the good Lord and the friendly angels be with you. We treasure the memory we created together this morning. Jenn’s kind and gentle manner helped us immensely.

Leland F.

Thank you to Dr. Winnick and the Peaceful Pathways staff for helping us through a very difficult day. Our decision to put to rest our Cider girl was difficult and with much anxiety. Dr. Winnick was nothing less than an angel through the entire process, as was the staff when we were making this decision. Dr. Winnick was prompt, patient, kind, and loving to Cider through the whole process. Although we are still sad and missing our little gal terribly, I would recommend Peaceful Pathways to anyone needing it.

Leland F.

On behalf of my entire family I wanted to thank you for the loving care that you gave our sweet Gus yesterday. You were so loving and kind to him and I know that he left this place surrounded by love and care, not only from our family, but from you as well. We are so thankful for you.

I just wanted to take a moment to extend my heartfelt gratitude for the kindness you showed to both me and Salem yesterday. Your patience and understanding were a blessing to us and I am so thankful that you were there to help Salem cross over. Like so many, Salem was such an important part of our lives, and while the decision to allow him to transition was obvious, it was still incredibly difficult. I am so thankful for the gentle people like yourself who make it their life’s work to care for the ones we love most. 

With much appreciation and a very full heart

It’s been almost a month since saying goodbye to my golden retriever “Molly” of 12 years. She had been slowing down quite a bit this past year, not wanting to walk as much and her eating routine was very different. After spending a very stressful day at the Emergency Vet, the following day I knew I had to make that difficult decision. Dr. Winnick came that morning and it was the best thing I could do for my “Molly”. Molly was in her home and she was comfortable and Dr. Winnick was very compassionate and so caring with my “Molly”. It was so peaceful for her and I will always have wonderful memories of her deep in my heart. To anyone who has to make that difficult decision I highly recommend Peaceful Pathways. 

Thank you so much, Dr Winnick💕

Margie B.

It has been a while since we used this wonderful service but the memories of how using Dr. Winnick helped us at a most terrible time have stayed with me. Our boy Carter had lymphoma and it was important to us not to take him to the vet he had started to fear after months of hard treatments. Not only did Dr. Winnick help us with an end of life assessment that made me feel I made the difficult choice to let him go at the right time, but her actions on the hard day were absolutely amazing for us. She was completely respectful of what this meant to us- letting a cherished family member go after over 15 years as the center of our family. She did not rush us- gave us as much time as we needed at every step. Being able to let our boy transition in my arms on the bed he slept on his whole life was a precious gift that I will never forget. Thank you with all my heart Dr. Winnick.

Meg P.

I recently had to make the difficult decision to have my elderly cat put to rest. He had been declining for some time but suddenly stopped eating and drinking, and in general it became obvious that he was fading out. It was just before a holiday weekend, and I was both grieving, and quite frankly, panicked at the thought of watching him suffer and decline further while being forced to wait for an appointment with a vet clinic sometime in the next week.

I called Peaceful Pathways in hope that my cat would have the chance to pass peacefully at home.

Their receptionist responded quickly and was very understanding, managing to make me an appointment on fairly short notice. She answered all the questions I had and was patient with me when I lost track of the conversation and began crying.

On the day of the appointment Dr. Winnick was exceptionally kind and gave me the time I needed to say goodbye. If I had to describe her in three words they would be; Compassionate, Respectful, and Patient. She never rushed me, listened patiently while I told her a couple of stories about my cats life, and explained everything about the process she would perform before waiting for me to make the final decision.

Making the choice to have a beloved pet put to rest is never an easy thing. Dr. Winnick and her team have my deep gratitude for their care and support.

Thank you for helping me send my little man off peacefully and without pain.

Alexis L.

My deepest gratitude to Dr. Winnick.  
What I expected to be the worst day imaginable turned out to be one filled with care, compassion, peace, and respect.

I will always be thankful for her wise counsel during our in-home visit the week prior, and for the profound empathy and kindness she extended on the day my aging, regal dog prepared to cross over.

I am truly grateful that there are people like you in this world—those who dedicate their lives to supporting both animals and their humans through life’s most difficult moments.

thank you

Nounou T.

There aren’t words to convey the level of gratitude I have for Dr Winnick and the Peaceful Pathways team. I will keep this short and simply say- “thank you. From the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU. You made a completely devastating experience bearable, and you helped my little Owen find the rainbow bridge, and over to the peace he needed. You guys provided us the best possible ending I could ever ask for.”

Bryan L.

The entire team at Peaceful Pathways is simply extraordinary. We sadly had to say goodbye to our sweet kitty, Luna, and it was, needless to say, extremely difficult. However, Dr. Winnick and her team made us all feel comfortable and supported. We were able to proceed at our own pace and never felt rushed, but instead received the utmost care and respect from her throughout the entire process. She handled everything with extreme compassion and empathy—from the moment she arrived, throughout the process, and days after. Thank you so much for making such a difficult time calming and peaceful for all of us. We know our Luna is happy now and at peace and we are forever grateful to you for that.

Laura J.

There are times in life that are just gut wrenching. Making the decision to put my silly and scrappy beagle Frank to sleep was one of them.

Dr. Minnick was so kind and gentle with Frank. As hard as it was to say goodbye, seeing him slip away so easily was a comfort.

Linda T.

Dr. Winnick and her staff were kind, compassionate, and professionally supportive in helping me to say goodbye to Luke. He was calm and comfortable as he made a peaceful exit. I’ve had to say goodbye to a number of furry family members over the years, and Peaceful Pathways provided the kindest and gentlest experience by far. I can’t recommend their service enough for anyone facing this difficult time.

Elizabeth F.

Dr. Karen just left our home. We had an extraordinary experience with her. She was so very compassionate & kind to our family. She explained each step carefully and gave us the opportunity to have the best goodbye possible. She allowed us all to be as involved as we individually wanted (my husband, me & our 3 teenage children) as well as our other doggie. We so appreciate her obvious caring nature to support us to say goodbye to our sweet Sofie. Thank you, Dr Karen

Julie P.

We had to put down our beloved Pluto in Sept 2021. It has taken me a few months to visit this website.  
Dr. Winnick visited us at home and helped take care of Pluto in his final moments. She was incredibly kind, loving, gentle to Pluto and so very considerate and patient with our emotions. She gave us ample time to say our goodbyes. Pluto is our first dog and we had no ideas of what to expect – so we are very grateful to Dr. Winnick for her guidance when we were at our lowest. Dr. Winnick was respectful of our Indian traditions and Pluto is in a happy place, free of pain thanks to her.

Arundhati S.

Thank you Dr. Winnick for your wonderful, compassionate service. Our kitty’s passing could not have been handled more beautifully. The support and empathy you offered gave me the confidence that we were doing the right thing.

Joanne H.

I want to take a minute and say the most heartfelt thank you. 

My family and I were absolutely wrecked from grief yesterday, and I was nervous about bringing a new doctor into such an uncomfortable and sensitive situation. Dr. Winnick was the best possible version of who we ended and made it possible to get some portion of relief and release in saying goodbye to Meeko. With the absolute full depth of our hearts – thank you.

This is the second time I’ve called Peaceful Pathways for help with my ailing pet. It is important to me to have my pet at home when it’s time for them to have this type of service. Dr. Winnich is such a compassionate and efficient person to facilitate an emotional procedure. You don’t have the feeling that there is anything more important for Peaceful Pathways than to take care of your precious pet. You have time to spend with them before and after the procedure with no time constraints. For me, it’s important to have my pets in their home environment when it’s time for this type of procedure. Peaceful Pathways and Dr. Winnich provide this comforting service, and I recommend it to my friends and to anyone who has to face this difficult decision.

Gloria K.

We called Peaceful Pathways, and, fortunately, Dr. Winnick was able to come that afternoon. We were so impressed with her compassion for us and our beloved Nutella. She explained everything in detail so we would know what to expect. I was afraid I would be hysterical during the procedure, but Dr. Winnick was so compassionate and calm that I was able to stay sane. Dr. Winnick never rushed us. Dr. Winnick gave us every opportunity to say goodbye and give us last kisses. I have already recommended Dr. Winnick to friends who have dogs. I know I will see Nutella again in heaven. Did you know that the word animal comes from the Latin word anima, which means soul? Yes, dogs have souls, and all dogs go to heaven!

Dr. Winnick – Thank you so much for coming today. It meant so much to us that we could all be with Tango. It was a really peaceful experience for her and us. Thank you again.

I just wanted to thank you for the way you handled that for our family on Saturday. I couldn’t envision a better way for Ed to pass on. Thank you.

Thank you again for all you do and all you’ve done. You really help make that decision and transition so much easier. I really appreciate your kindness and caring. Thank you so much.

**Jennifer**

I wanted to tell you that you made us feel much more comfortable about the whole process. The way you handled everything was very gentle but professional at the same time. Mia deserved to be taken care of with love and respect, which you provided. Thanks again for everything.

I want to tell you, again, how much I appreciated your quick phone response, willingness to come over the same day (on a Sunday no less) and, of course, your compassionate care of both Whiskey and me. I really feel it is such an important service that you provide, and you are clearly the right person for it.

Thank you so much for everything. You really helped our family with a tough time, and we all appreciate your sensitivity and kindness.

I don’t know how well we expressed our gratitude yesterday for how you helped us with Max. You were so wonderful. We only felt warmth from you. We never felt like we were rushed. 

Ian and I are so incredibly grateful for your business and your demeanor and love for our pets and empathy for the owners.

We thank you from the bottom of our hearts.

Thank you for your sympathy during our time of loss. Your kind words are a comfort to us as we grieve our ‘Best Friend’s’ death.

Thank you for your help during this difficult time for our family. Bless you for your kindness and services.

I wanted to write and thank you so very much for your help with Fred earlier this month. I was so incredibly sad and anxious about the decision, and how the process was going to be, and you made the experience extremely loving and peaceful. Your calm, caring demeanor, professionalism and knowledge helped us move through the process at a pace that was right for us – not too slow and not too fast. We really had no idea what to expect, and your service not only met but exceeded our expectations. Thank you for making a day we were dreading into a day filled with peace, love and compassion.

We are very grateful for the kind and compassionate care Dr. Winnick provided. Her thoughtful demeanor helped us through a very difficult process. At each step, we were fully informed and given as much time as we needed, and we were reassured and supported in our grief. Thank you so much!

I cannot be more thankful for your help and immediate availability; it was a very hard time and decision to take; you were very kind and supportive in our loss. Casper was very important to us for almost 20 years, and he will always be in our hearts. It was very hard to say goodbye to him. Thank you for helping Casper and be with us in that difficult time. You gave him trust, and he understood you are there for him and to help him showing your love.

I wish to thank you again for your compassionate and caring program. I can’t say enough how much I appreciated every choice and thoughtful detail. The procedure, though sad, left me with the memory of Parfait being well taken care of at just the right time.

Rachel and I want to extend our sincerest gratitude for your gift to us and our sweet Joey girl yesterday. We feel absolutely heartbroken over this loss, but are eternally grateful to you. I’m sure you get this a lot, but you were our angel yesterday. Thank you ❤️

Thank you so much for helping us with Jack. You were an amazing professional and a warm heart at a time we needed both.

Thank you Dr. Winnick for your wonderful, compassionate service. Our kitty’s passing could not have been handled more beautifully. The support and empathy you offered gave me the confidence that we were doing the right thing. 

**Joanne H.**

There is no better way to say goodbye to your loved one than in their own home and with a gentle and caring person and vet such as Jen. She makes the experience so comforting and respectful with great sensitivity to both you and your pets needs. Thank you for your special talent and creating this important service. I’m so very grateful and impressed.

Janice F.

Dr. Winnick “Jenn”,  
I just wanted to say thank you for making Mitzy’s transition as good as possible. You were perfect and I appreciate so much being able to do “it” in my home. Thank you, thank you for your caring and sensitivity.  
Mitzy was a perfect kitty for me and I wanted her to not feel any stress or pain. It all happened as you said.  
Know that I appreciate you and your caring service VERY much!!!  
Many thanks

Thank you so much. So hard to be without Maggie but thankful she wasn’t stressed and anxious. You made this difficult day better.

From the very first, Dr. Winnick was so friendly, down-to-earth, and grounded as she gave us information in one of the most challenging times of my life…information on how my beloved bearded collie was going to be released out of his body through euthanasia. When she arrived I was pretty much in denial at how close the time was and pretty much fell apart after she left even though I felt very safe with her and trusted her immediately. During the next two weeks I changed the date a couple times and each time the Dr. and her staff were very patient, they’ve been through this kind of confusion and anxiety so many times and they are real pros at handling this. When the day arrived she came in and greeted Rumi and my friends who had gathered. Rumi lay down right beside her as she gave the first shot. I feel he trusted her too. She then gave us plenty of time to read a poem, shower him with rose petals and say our goodbyes. Before she shaved his leg to give him the final injection she asked me if it was okay. I nodded yes and she went ahead. The injection was done slowly and Rumi quietly drifted into eternity. Then one of my friends and Dr. Winnick carried him out on a stretcher.

The experience was seamless and I feel so grateful that we had a compassionate person to handle the details and expertise. I recommend Dr. Winnick without reservation. And you will love her beautiful kind blue eyes. By the way, Rumi’s ashes arrived today and everything was exactly as we asked. Thank you, Dr. Winnick and staff.

**Carol**

Thank you to Dr. Winnick and the Peaceful Pathways staff for helping us through a very difficult day. Our decision to put to rest our Cider girl was difficult and with much anxiety. Dr. Winnick was nothing less than an angel through the entire process, as was the staff when we were making this decision. Dr. Winnick was prompt, patient, kind and loving to Cider through the whole process. Although we are still sad and missing our little gal terribly, I would recommend Peaceful Pathways to anyone needing it.

Andrea C.

Just wanted to say thank you again. Being able to do this in our home made it easier to say goodbye, and I think Po was happier as well.
