We had to put our large dog Bailey down due to bone cancer. Dr Rebecca Westbrook was very professional and made everything go so smooth. We could not ask for a better vet to help our baby pass on.

Our Neo had about as smooth an experience as he could have. We were told about the process and understood everything which allowed us to set things up exactly right and be ready.  
  
My wife and I both enjoyed that she was straight forward with the process and it made it clean and smooth. Thank you for helping us through this necessary but unfortunate process.

Dr. Westbrook is a gem. She has been with us for the passing of three of our fur babies over the last ten years. If you have the opportunity to allow your pet to pass in the comfort of your home, it is the best option. Calm, no other patients, etc. Dr. Westbrook is so knowledgeable and kind, we highly recommend.

I can’t say enough good things about Rebecca. Incredibly compassionate and understanding. My dog instantly loved her and felt so comfortable during her euthanasia. I would choose this company a million times over. And will recommend to anyone and everyone who sees this. So much appreciation for how today went.

My husband and I had to put our old gal to sleep recently, and Dr. Westbrook was a great help to do so. She was very responsive when I reached out with questions and scheduling. She was calm and kind during the procedure, which helped us to not freak out too much. Thank you for helping our girl cross the rainbow bridge in bed, laying right on her dad 🌈 When the time comes again - hopefully not for a long, long time - we will absolutely be calling Loving Paws again.

Dr Westbrook was able to make it over quicker than I anticipated. She spent almost 2 hours with my sick dog and was so incredibly thorough. She explained the treatment options and was mindful of cost restraints. She is kind, knowledgeable, and I’m so grateful to have a vet like her in my area. I feel that she went above and beyond for us. Thank you so much.

Dr Westbrook has assisted me and my family with the euthanasia of two of my pets. She has been the best at reassuring the family that we are making the right decision and has been very comforting to the family thru that process. I highly recommend her for your needs. She has a true love for animals/pets and is very compassionate in end of life care. She made me and my family very comfortable and secure in our decision. I will highly recommend her 100 percent.

Dr. Westbrook responded quickly to our text and took our call as we knew the dreaded day was near to say goodbye to our beloved MaltiPoo, Gigi. We wanted the experience to be as gentle and compassionate as possible.  
Dr. Westbrook spent more than 20 minutes listening to our concerns about timing and offering the kindest and most considerate thoughts about our personal situation. She was patient and understood how we felt so we scheduled the visit.  
Sadly, two days before our appointment, Gigi passed away in the ER. It was so traumatic and the opposite of what we had hoped and prayed.  
Although we never got to meet Dr. Westbrook in person, we wanted to give her the highest recommendation. We believe her service is priceless, after all, our companions are beloved family members.

We have called on Loving Paws twice in the past two years. The service Dr. Westbrook provided to us and our 2 geriatric labs was prompt, professional, compassionate, supportive, understanding and loving. We have recommended this service to all our friends and family. We’re so thankful we found Dr. W and we will be forever grateful for her.

Dr. Westbrook was so kind. We had to say goodbye to our 15 year old dog. We were all very emotional. She was a calming and reassuring presence. She had all the right words to patiently explain to the kids what was happening. Her compassion went a long way towards softening a very painful moment in our lives.

I cannot express adequately how thankful I am for the compassionate services that Dr. Westbrook provides. I have used LovingPaws for 3 of my dear fur babies over a period of almost 10 years. The end of life of a beloved pet is heart breaking, but there is so much comfort in helping them with a gentle way of passing in their own home. Their last day and my memory of that day is so much better than the vet hospital alternative. When it is possible to chose the time and place, I would always want to do so.

She was great. She made a really difficult situation easier for everyone in our household.  
The ability to allow Rusty to end his time in our home and not at the vets office, which he hated, was very welcome.  
She gave us time to spend with him and was very considerate of our feelings in that moment.  
I would highly recommend.

Dr Westbrook Took excellent care of our sweet Lil Ole Lady. She Was very compassionate and kind and patient.  
I don’t want to see her again anytime soon though , but highly recommend her and will use her when the time comes again. Thank you again!

If I had to do it over again there’s no doubt I would go with Dr. Westbrook. She is REALLY nice and was able to work with us last minute.  
Also from a dog’s perspective she looks really “non threatening” which is what you want. The last thing I wanted for our dog is to feel uncomfortable or in danger.

Dr. Westbrook was so comforting. She came right after I called her, which was great! She explained the procedure and what was going to happen after injections. She was very concerned with my feelings and answered all my questions. Thank you Dr. Westbrook.

Dr. Westbrook is an angel. It was so much better to be in our own home instead of having to drive. I will be using her again, but hopefully not for awhile! Highly recommend Loving Paws.  
Updated 2023- it was time to say goodbye to out precious old girl today, and we chose Dr. Westbrook for the second time in 5 years. She's kind, responsive & gentle. Such a blessing to be able to say goodbye in our own home, in our own way. Thank you.

Dr. Westbrook is absolutely wonderful and incredibly compassionate. We had to say goodbye to our 10 year old goldendoodle, Luna yesterday. This service is absolutely worth everything to me, we were able to create a peaceful environment for our baby to comfortably cross the rainbow bridge. This was one of the hardest days ever, but being able to do it at home made it less stressful. Thank you so much for everything. 💙

I've had to utilize Dr. Westbrook's services a title of 4 times over the last 10 years and I won't use anyone else. She is professional, very compassionate and gives you as much time before and after to be with your pet as you need. All 4 of my babies passed while lying on my stomach on the sofa, just like any normal day. There was no stress of taking a sick and dying beloved pet to a veterinary office. She even makes the arrangements to have them picked up for cremation or burial. She's fantastic.

We have used Loving Paws three times over the last 10 years for our cats. The peace of mind we have gotten from being able to let them go at home is beyond measure. Dr. Westbrook is punctual, professional, caring, and compassionate. We have recommended her services to several friends who have also used her and have sang her praises as well. We are so glad we have her to help us through really difficult decisions and times in a peaceful, respectful manner.

What a gift this service gave our family. I would recommend Rebecca a thousand times over. This was such a beautiful, peaceful and dignified experience.

December 22, 2021 both of my babies Dakota and Rock went over the Rainbow Bridge with the kind assistance of Dr Westbrook and her assistant Kellie (?)... prior Dr Westbrook helped me throughout my anxieties of how others were telling me that's a mean thing to do all kinds of things.. this was my first going through this... they were 13 going on 14 also brother/sister from the same litter... there was countless moments prior to December 22nd of crying for them... they were my life, I planned things around them... wherever we went and moved... I always thought about Dakota/Rock... they both were not scared or showing any anxiety.. I held them both until their last breath. This is a different kind of grief that I have never experienced I've had them for so long, 6 weeks old until December 22nd, they were 13. I still feel their presence with me.  
  
This service I fell takes a special kind of person with a kind spirit. I found that in Dr Westbrook. Dr Westbrook is amazing and like i said this was my first time doing this. The aftercare was amazing, I received them on December 24th (xmas eve) and I almost fainted. Dr Westbrook and her assistant handled them with such great care before and after the procedure.  
  
Thank you for reading this, you will not go wrong with choosing Dr Westbrook, I chose her because of her kind spirit along with the communication prior and after... Dr Westbrook talked with my mom, she had came into town to support me and my mom took it so hard as well... Dr Westbrook talked with her prior and afterwards as well. I cannot say enough words to compliment and praise the service she provides.  
  
I know this is a hard decision to make for us pet owners, I am thankful to have acquired Dr Westbrook's service for the last moments of both of my dogs lives... now its such an empty home without them...  
  
Thank-you for all you do Dr Westbrook!

Dr. Westbrook was phenomenal. She made one of the hardest days as easy as possible. She was kind and warm and very gentle with my pet. She walked us through every step of the way and gave us all the time and space we needed. I would highly recommend her to anyone looking for in home options for their pets passing. While I hope you never need her, she’s the best person to call when you do.

I just wanted my sweet girl to go peacefully without pain or anxiety. I got that with Dr. Westbrook’s service. On time and professional, quick and gentle.  
My girlfriend said she was like a kind whisper, helped our sick girl, and was gone.  
I’m writing this the day after and I’ve been crying constantly. The thing that has helped me the most is knowing how peaceful my dogs last moments were. Thank you so much Dr. Westbrook for doing what you do and how you do it. It can’t be easy seeing people day in and day out on their worst day, but you’re amazing for this.

We've used Dr Westbrook for many years. She is truly an angel and makes an unbearable situation so much better and peaceful. It's the last act of kindness for our fur babies to send them onto the afterlife with dignity, peace and love. I don't know how she is able to do what she does but I'm forever grateful that our last moments with our babies are intimate, quiet and not rushed. I cannot recommend her enough.

I am so thankful I found Dr. Westbrook. She made a difficult time much easier. Dr. Westbrook was patient and kind, explaining the entire process and allowing as much time as we needed to say goodbye. It was such a relief to offer my little kitty peace in his own space without the trauma of a vet visit (he had severe anxiety outside of the home). It was well worth it and I’m very grateful to her for her service and attentiveness.

Dr. Westbrook was great! We had to move quickly to transition our pet over the rainbow bridge and she came out to our house less than 24 hours after we connected. Dr. Westbrook made the transition easy, explained in great detail the process, and followed up quickly with grief handouts for us to review read during this difficult time. I highly recommend Dr. Westbrook for her services and she will be the first person we reach out to should me ever have to make the transition for another pet. Than you Dr. Westbrook for your guidance and kindness to us and Hana.

Dr. Westbrook is awesome! She came out and helped our 12 year old OES cross the rainbow bridge. The experience was the very best it could have been. I will never do it any other way!!!! I gave a lady at Allen Vets her info  
yesterday. She was inquiring to the ladies behind the desk if they knew of any other way  
because their retriever was very hard to take anywhere. I spoke up after they said they did not. She was so thankful I gave her Dr. Westbrook’s number. Before I left, the ladies behind the counter asked for Dr. Westbrook’s  
info so they can refer rollers to her.  
It has been about 11 years since we had to say goodbye to Murphy but I have told countless people about the awesome experience we had.  
Thank you Dr. Westbrook!

Dr. Westbrook was amazing! We were having a very difficult time with our decision to let Bubbles go. We knew it was the right thing but she was having such a good morning the day of the appointment we considered backing out. Dr. Westbrook assured us that we had made the right decision. Bubbles had cancer and one tumor was in the roof of her mouth and had begun spreading toward her throat. Dr Westbrook explained to us how aggressive oral cancers are and that we had made the right decision at the right time. She made the whole experience as easy as it could be given the situation. Instead of being clinical it was like having a friend or family member help you through it. She talked to us the entire time, letting us know what she was doing and what to expect. Our baby girl slipped into peace and she was able to do it in her own home. The caring and personal attention of Dr. Westbrook made all the difference in the world.

You never want to have to make the phone call, to arrange for someone to come to your house to put your dog down. But I’m glad I picked at home and Dr. Westbrook was the one to help. She took the time to explain the procedure, and the time frame of each step. She answered all my questions and even shared stories. She was very sweet to my dog, letting her feel calm and not have anything to fear. Nothing felt rushed for a minute, I was able to give my puppy the love through it all. She also explained how to help my other dog with the process. Thank you for making such a hard time a little easier.

The stress of loosing a pet, knowing it's time and then realizing I am paying for this service out of love for my pet, this final thing I can do is for the benefit of my pet. During this thought process the thought does cross a person's mind... what it.. what if this person is in a hurry or not kind .. what if they are a know-it-all or judgemental. However, As soon as I opened the door those worries were lifted from my shoulders. Dr. Westbrook is an Angel in the flesh. She made us just as comfortable in her presence as she did our Labrador Storm. She was polite, kind, respectful, knowledgeable, professional and we were so appreciative of this! Storm went to sleep. He was a little dehydrated but not an issue for Doctor of her skill set. She calmly spoke to Storm and us. She felt like somebody I had known for years, tho we just met. Any person reading must be on the road we just took. Let me tell you I would book the appointment and not worry! Dr. Westbrook is GREAT!

I met Dr. Westbrook a little over 3 years ago when a customer of mine asked me to come be with her when she chose to end the pain and suffering of her beloved fur baby and help her cross the Rainbow Bridge. She was compassionate beyond all measure to the pet and their owner. Soft spoken and educational throughout the process from the beginning to end of her visit. making a visual assessment at the beginning providing information that will validate the pet owners decision or prolong if decided. Dr Westbrook is full on information, no rushing the process, giving pet and owner plenty of time for love, conversation and goodbyes.  
From that first meeting of Dr Westbrook I have personally had to use her for my beloved Suzee ‘Q’ and also referred her to friends and pet sitting customers. She has been to my home more than once to assist pet sitting customers of mine with their elderly or ill pet and each and every time she exhibited endless compassion for them.  
What Dr Westbrook does is not popular for any veterinarian, nor are their dozens of mobile vets in the DFW area doing what she does either. Thank goodness for her!! She is genuine, compassionate, sensitive and caring with the handling and final care of your fur baby whether canine or feline. All that she offers and provides cannot be weighed or measured. She is Exclusive HouseSitting’s mobile veterinarian of choice and I highly recommend her 100%.

Dr. Westbrook has come to our house to help with the passing of both our dogs. She makes the unbearable a little more bearable.

There aren’t enough words to express how great their services are and how amazing the vet was.  
  
This was the first time I’ve ever had to put a dog to sleep so I wasn’t sure what to expect. She arrived on time, was professional, compassionate and explained what could be expected and answered questions that we had in a clear, understandable language.  
  
Her energy was calming and bedside manner was perfect.... when it’s time for my other dog to pass, I will absolutely be using them again and I will encourage anyone who is going thru the end of life with their pet, to use them also.

It has been almost 3 years since Dr Westbrook came to put my sweet black lab Dixie to sleep and I still SO grateful to her because of how invaluable she was the last 6 months of my dog’s life. She was able to give Dixie 6 more months with a really great quality of life. I feel like we got an extra 6 months together. Dixie struggled with pain and her hind legs not always working like she wanted them to and Dr Westbrook was so helpful in diagnosing, managing her pain, being available for questions and helping me evaluate when the right time was to let her go. Dr. Westbrook was available by phone to talk through and adjust meds as needed and I was so thankful for her personal and professional care and availability. Dixie had a good quality of life because of her care. Separately, when it came time to let Dixie go, having Dr. Westbrook come to my house was the right thing for me. I was able to have her confirm it was time and to say goodbye without all the stress of the vet. Dixie was the first pet I have had as an adult and the first pet I had to put down. It sounds crazy to say, my last memories were good and sweet. As much as that is possible. :)

Loving Paws was the best way that we could lay our sweet Buddy to rest. We were in the comfort of our own home and he wasn’t in an unfamiliar place.

I've used Dr Westbrook twice now. Once for in house euthanasia and now for Hospice care on another dog. The service she provides is invaluable.  
Appointments are easy to book and she is responsive to voice and email. She is always on time and makes a rather difficult process easier for both pets and humans alike.

Dr. Westbrook was a godsend for my dog Shep. She kept him alive 3 years past what was believed to be possible and in the end, gave him peace at his home. Having to put a pet down is always hellish but in this case, it was much easier with Dr. Westbrook. She doesn't use that cold distant bedside behavior many Doctors of all types show. The medications she prescribed for Shep worked wonders and he stayed with me much longer than anyone expected, for that she will always have my eternal gratitude.  
  
Seriously if you are at the end or need geriatric care this vet is perfect. I next to never give perfect ratings on anything, but there is nothing here to take anything off. She's simply a wonderful person and clearly cares

Dr. Westbrook helped both of our pets on to Kitty Heaven. I HIGHLY recommend her. Read through her website; it is very thorough, professional, and informative - an accurate reflection of its author.  
  
We lost our beloved Isabeau in August. She deteriorated quickly and our vet, who was unable to come, recommended Dr. Westbrook. We had had a difficult experience with a former pet/ different vet's office, so we had some anxiety and we definitely wanted this to take place in the peace and security of our home.  
Dr. Westbrook was gentle, calm, & totally professional. She arrived on time, explained everything clearly and showed the highest respect for our sweet little girl. She expertly found a viable vein although our little one was dehydrated. (that had been our former "bad experience".) A gentle and peaceful drift to sleep for our treasured one.  
We always adopt our pets in pairs, and in December we had to make that horrible choice again when our remaining kitty stopped responding to his thyroid meds. Just knowing we had Rebecca to call made things easier. Squeaky was a "daddy's boy", so I left the room before Rebecca gave him the sedation shot so my husband (his idol) was with him. When I returned a minute later, my husband was gently stroking Squeaky, but where was Rebecca? Then I saw her, sitting in a chair in the far dark corner of our living room, totally still. Respecting our pet, removing her unfamiliar presence from his space until the sedation took effect. She quickly discerns your pet's temperament and adapts her behavior to suit him/her.  
Squeaky was more dehydrated than Bo had been, but Rebecca still easily found a vein. Of course he was sedated and wouldn't have felt anything anyways, but it shows her expertise. She's the best, and we are forever grateful.

Dr. Westbrook was absolutely amazing. On our worst day of having a very large dog that was suddenly at the end of her days and could not be moved from the house without badly hurting her, Dr. Westbrook came to our home and allowed our beloved dog to have her last hours in the company of her family and laying in her favorite spot. Dr. Westbrook has wonderful bedside manner, great, honest and compassionate communication.  
The crematory services were also so kind and wonderful as well. I cannot give a higher recommendation for this service to make your worst day ever easier for your family and your dog.

Dr. Westbrook was as professional and compassionate as you could possible want for such a difficult time. She was brilliant.
