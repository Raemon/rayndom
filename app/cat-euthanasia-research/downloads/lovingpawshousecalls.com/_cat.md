Hi, I am Dr. Rebecca Westbrook. I know this a challenging time for you if you are considering in-home euthanasia for your cat

## **What makes Loving Paws House Calls Stand Out**

**My goal is to make your kitty as comfortable as possible by…**

****

  * **not ringing doorbells ( I text when I arrive )**
  * **working where your cat is the happiest …cat tree, under bed, in the closet etc.**
  * **minimal handling (unless your kitty is a love bug)**
  * **sedating to full anesthesia before giving the final euthanasia injection ( oral and injectable sedation options)**

## **New oral sedation option available for cats**

I am excited to announce that I have a new oral sedation option for cats. In the past, the only option available for sedation was by injection. While injectable sedation works well, about 50% of cats look over their shoulder, meow, or say “Forget you, lady, I am heading for my safe space under the bed. “

I now have the option to use oral sedation for cats that are comfortable taking medication by mouth. Both oral and injectable sedation work well. I discuss both options when I come to the house call. The choice is made based on your cat’s personality.

## **How Sedation Works in Cats**

Both Oral and Injectable sedation have pain medicine, muscle relaxers and anti-nausea included. My goal with sedation is for your cat for to reach anesthesia level so your cat doesn’t feel pain and does not know I am giving the final euthanasia solution.

Oral sedation takes 5-15 minutes to take effect

Injectable sedation takes 5-7 minutes to take effect.

Once your kitty is “unaware” I will give the final euthanasia injection in a vein. This works super quick and most cats pass in under 30 seconds.

## **Cremation Options for Cats**

You have several options for aftercare.

A lot of my clients chose to bury. I recommend checking your local ordinances about home burial.

I provide both communal and private cremation options. I will take your cat with me after the appointment. I will place your cat in a basket with a new blanket. If you prefer to send your kitty in a special bed or blanket, just let me know.

If you choose communal cremation, you will not get the ashes back. Your cat will be cremated with other pets and buried in a field overlook a pond.

If you choose private cremation, your cat will be privately cremated and the ashes will be placed in a cedar box. You may either pick up the ashes in Rockwall, have the ashes delivered to your vet ( depending on location), or mailed.
