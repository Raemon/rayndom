# Dr. Westbrook

## Let’s Get to Know Each Other

## Everyone Has A Story, Here Is Mine.

Dr. Rebecca Westbrook grew up in middle Tennessee on a small farm. Her parents allowed her to experience the joy of taking care of a variety of animals. While horses are her first “large animal” love, she also raised sheep and bottle feed calves. Her personal pets included dogs, cats, hamsters, snakes and “Polly” the parakeet.

## University Of Tennesse School Of Veterinary Medicine

After graduating from the University of Tennesse School of Veterinary Medicine in 2000, Dr. Westbrook moved back to her home town and worked in a mixed animal practice. Due to the economy’s struggles after 9-11, Dr. Westbrook had to move to find a more stable economic area. She decided that living by the beach would be an interesting change and she practiced several years in Pensacola, Florida before finding her way home to the great state of Texas.

## Happily Married

Dr. Rebecca Westbrook met and then married her husband Craig Westbrook in May of 2008. Craig is a local Garland, Texas native. They are currently living in Garland, TX which allows them to be close to family and work. Dr. Westbrook household is run by three beautiful girls. Alexis who is 11 and loves doing arts and crafts and reading, Caitlan who is 9, loves her dog Phantom and wants to be a veterinarian when she grows up. Last but not least is Sarah age 6 who is fearless and is a card shark. When Dr. Westbrook is not helping clients and shepherding her girls, she loves to garden and read. Her favorite current reads are mystery who-done-its and fantasy epics.

## Local Roots

Dr. Westbrook has been involved heavily involved in the local Veterinary Medical Association. She built their current website and served as secretary, vice-president and president of the Collin County Veterinary Medical Association.

Over the past years she has helped over 7000 families. Dr. Westbrook is always honored when her clients allow her to be a part of the last moments with their beloved pets.
