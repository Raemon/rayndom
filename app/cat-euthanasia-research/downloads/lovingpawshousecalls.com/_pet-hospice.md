## Gift Your Pet With The Loving Paws Difference

While working with over 4000 families with their pet’s end-of-life care needs, we have also seen clients who simply wish to prevent their beloved pets from suffering as they age. Loving Paws pet hospice is focused on treating the symptoms that are affecting your pet’s quality of life.

## What Is Pet Hospice Care?

We want to empower and educate you to become your pet’s best advocate with their end-of-life care.

Our pet hospice program has 3 types of consults. We can help your pet by Offering a personal house call to evaluate your pet in the comfort of your home & observing your pet in their home environment and helping you identify their specific subtle behavior and pain cues. All medications are prescribed to a local or online pharmacy. We are allowed to give you refills for up to a year. This option is $500.

During the Covid crisis you may prefer to limit your personal exposure, but still, help your pet. We offer an online/phone consult with a limited exam that allows us to prescribe medications. This 30-minute consult allows you to consult with the veterinarian about your concerns and your pet’s needs. The veterinarian will then drive by your home the following day and do a limited visual exam. This allows your pet to receive prescription medications for up to a year but limits your exposure to Covid. This option is $300.

Some of our clients only need a quality of life consult. This consult is done online or over the phone. This consult is to give you information only and is to help you with your decisions. This consult does not allow medications to be prescribed. This option is $150.

## Our Goal Is To Work With You And Your Pet To Improve All Aspects Of Your Pet’s Life

Unlike in human medicine, when we can no longer improve your pet’s quality of life you have the option to choose to help your pet die with dignity instead of letting your pet’s illness become a crisis. The decision for end-of-life care needs to be made when medications or surgery can no longer improve your pet’s symptoms or quality of life.
