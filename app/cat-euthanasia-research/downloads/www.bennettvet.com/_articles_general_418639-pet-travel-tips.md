## Pet Travel Tips

  * Created in Newsletter Library, Tips for Pet Owners 



Are you planning to hit the road with your pets this summer?

Whether you are planning a lengthy family road trip or a quick summer getaway, there are some important things you need to know before making the decision to travel with your pets. Use the following tips to guarantee a safe and stress-free trip for the whole family!

**Safety Tips**

Firstly, remember to buckle up. Your pets should be just as secure in a moving vehicle as you are. Moreover, it is distracting and dangerous to allow your pets to move freely about the car while you are driving. The best way to protect your pet in the car is to use a pet carrier for the duration of your journey. Use a special seatbelt to secure your pet carrier in the backseat; this will protect your pet from bouncing around on the road. For their safety and your own, do not position your pet in the front seat of your car. If an airbag deploys while your pet is in the front seat, it could cause serious harm to your pet — even if they are in a crate.

Next, while your pet may love sticking his or her head out of car windows during road trips, the ASPA maintains that keeping your pets _inside_ your vehicle is imperative for your pet’s safety and wellbeing. Protect your pets from flying debris, ear damage and exposure to lung infections by keeping their paws, tails and heads inside the vehicle at all times.

Just as you likely travel with snacks and water for yourself, you should plan to feed your pet at their regularly scheduled meal times to prevent them from getting hungry and agitated on the road. The amount of food and water you should bring depends on the length and duration of your trip, so plan accordingly. It is recommended that you bring at least 1 gallon of water with you on your trip to ensure your pet stays properly hydrated. Also, try to make frequent stops throughout your trip, so your pet can drink, stretch his or her legs and use the bathroom when needed.

Lastly, never leave your pets alone in the car. Even if you are making a quick stop, temperatures inside your car can increase dramatically within a very short period of time. Within an hour, the temperature inside your car can rise over 40 degrees and cause your pet to suffer from heatstroke, organ damage and even death. Instead of leaving your pets inside your vehicle when you stop for lunch or a short break, try to eat and stop at pet-friendly establishments. Nowadays, many restaurants allow you to bring pets to their outdoor patios and have them sit with you while you eat your meal. Most restaurants indicate whether or not they are pet friendly on their website or social media pages, so check there before you make a stop.
