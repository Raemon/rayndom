Vetopedia is a glossary of terms used by vets in treating animals.

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z

**AAFCO**  
Association of American Feed Control Officials; an organization which sets standards for pet food ingredients and minimum daily requirements.

**Abdomen**  
A region of the body between the chest and the pelvis; belly.

**Abdominocentesis**  
The insertion of a needle into the abdominal cavity to remove fluids.

**Abscess**  
A localized accumulation of pus; usually associated with infection.

**ACE Inhibitor**  
Angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor: Drug which decreases the function of this particular enzyme. The angiotensin-converting-enzyme changes a compound called angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a potent blood vessel constrictor. ACE inhibitors, then, have the effect of dilating blood vessels, since less Angiotensin II is produced.

**Acid**  
A fluid containing a high proportion of hydrogen ions, giving the liquid a sour taste. Measured by pH units, with 1 the most acid, and 14 the least acid. Chemical reactions in the body have to take place at or near neutrality, pH 7.

**ACTH**  
Adrenocorticotropic hormone. A hormone, secreted by the pituitary gland, which stimulates the adrenal gland to work.

**Activated Charcoal**  
Charcoal which has been treated to increase its adsorptive power (ability to have chemicals adhere to it); used to treat various forms of poisoning.

**Active Immunity**  
Immunity produced when an animal's own immune system reacts to a stimulus e.g., a virus or bacteria, and produces antibodies and cells which will protect it from the disease caused by the bacteria or virus. Compare with 'passive immunity.'

**Acute**  
Having a sudden and generally severe onset. See also Chronic.

**Addisons Disease**  
Addison's disease is also known as hypoadrenocorticism. It is a disease that results from a decrease in corticosteroid secretion from the adrenal gland.

**Adjuvant**  
A substance added to killed vaccines to stimulate a better immune response by the body. Common adjuvants contain aluminum compounds.

**Adrenal Glands**  
Two small glands near the kidneys that produce many hormones required for life.

**Adrenaline**  
A hormone produced by the adrenal glands that elevates heart and respiration rates; also called 'epinephrine.'

**Adrenergic**  
Communication between the nerves and muscles that uses epinephrine as the 'messenger.' Adrenergic stimulation is what is involved in the 'flight or fight' response, which means the body is alerted to a danger of some sort and prepares to basically run or fight. Adrenergic stimulation results in an increased heart rate, sweating, and increased blood pressure.

**Adsorbent**  
A solid substance which attracts other molecules to its surface.

**Adulticide**  
Medication formulated to kill adult forms of a parasite.

**Aerobic**  
Needing oxygen to live. See also Anaerobic bacteria.

**Albino**  
An animal that is completely white because it lacks the ability to make pigment. Its eyes are pale blue or pink.

**Albumin**  
A protein in the blood responsible for the maintenance of osmotic (water) pressure in the blood; also binds (attaches) to large molecules in the blood and serves to transport them; produced by the liver; also called 'serum albumin.'

**Aldosterone**  
A hormone secreted by the adrenal gland that stimulates sodium (and therefore water) retention and potassium excretion; important in blood pressure maintenance.

**Alimentary**  
Pertaining to food or the digestive tract.

**Alkaline**  
A substance with very few hydrogen ions, and a pH over 7. Lye is strongly alkaline.

**Allergen**  
A substance that causes an allergic reaction, e.g., pollen.

**Alopecia**  
A loss of hair or baldness.

**Alveoli**  
The tiny microscopic areas of the lung where the actual exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide into and out of the blood occurs. Also called alveolus and alveolar sacs.

**Aminoglycoside**  
A class of antibiotics which act by interfering with bacterial protein synthesis within the bacteria which results in the death of the bacteria. Antibiotics in this class include gentamicin (Gentocin), kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, tobramycin, and amikacin. Many of these antibiotics are not well-absorbed from the animal's digestive system, so are often administered as injections, or used topically.

**Amylase**  
Digestive enzyme, produced by the pancreas which breaks down carbohydrates and starches.

**Anabolic Steroid**  
A type of steroid (not a corticosteroid like prednisone, cortisone, or dexamethasone) which promotes the building of tissues, like muscle.

**Androgen**  
A hormone which produces male sexual characteristics, e.g., testosterone.

**Anemia**  
A condition in which the number of red blood cells present in the blood is lower than normal.

**Anesthesia**

**Angiography**  
The x-ray of vessels after injecting a contrasting fluid.

**Angiotensin-Converting-Enzyme Inhibitor**  
(ACE inhibitor) Drug which decreases the function of this particular enzyme. The angiotensin-converting-enzyme changes a compound called angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a potent blood vessel constrictor. ACE inhibitors, then, have the effect of dilating blood vessels, since less Angiotensin II is produced.

**Anisocoria**  
A condition in which the pupils of the eyes are not of equal size.

**Anorexia**  
Loss of appetite.

**Anterior**

**Antibiotics**  
Usually refers to drugs administered to kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria; not effective against viral infections.

**Antibody**  
Small disease-fighting proteins produced by certain types of cells called 'B cells.' The proteins are made in response to 'foreign' particles such as bacteria or viruses. These antibodies bind with certain proteins (antigens) on foreign particles like bacteria, to help inactivate them. See also Antigen.

**Antibody Titer**  
A measurement of the amount of antibodies in the blood. The test to measure antibodies is usually performed by making a number of dilutions of the blood and then measuring at what dilution there is sufficient antibody to react in the test. For example, a titer of 1:8 (one to eight) means the blood can be diluted to one part blood and seven parts saline and still produce a positive reaction in the test. The higher the titer (1:16 is higher than 1:8), the more antibody is present.

**Anticholinergic**  
Stopping the communications between certain nerves and muscles of the body including those of the gastrointestinal tract and heart. These nerves are called 'parasympathetic' nerves and do such things as constrict the pupils of the eye, stimulate contractions of the muscles in the intestine, and slow the heart rate. Anticholinergic drugs would have the effect, then, of dilating the pupil, slowing contractions of the intestines, and increasing the heart rate.

**Anticholinesterase**  
A drug that blocks the enzyme acetylcholinesterase; this results in stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system.

**Anticoagulation**  
Stopping the blood clotting process.

**Anticonvulsant**

An agent that decreases or stops vomiting.

**Antifungal**  
Drugs administered to kill or inhibit the growth of fungi (plural of fungus).

**Antigen**

**Antiprotozoal**  
An agent that kills protozoa, which are one-celled organisms such as Giardia.

**Antipruritic**  
Relieves itching.

**Antipyretic**  
A substance used to relieve fever.

**Antiseptic**

**Auscultate**  
To listen for sounds produced within the body, usually with the aid of a stethoscope.

**Autoimmune**  
A condition in which the immune system attacks the body's own tissues. To properly function, the immune system must identify foreign substances such as bacteria, viruses, parasites, slivers, etc., and it must be able to distinguish normal body tissue from these foreign substances. If it fails to distinguish the difference, it attempts to destroy the tissue it wrongly identifies as foreign. For example, in autoimmune hemolytic anemia, the body destroys its own red blood cells. In rheumatoid arthritis it attacks the cells in the joints.
