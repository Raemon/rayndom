If you’re thinking of getting a pet fish, you should know that your veterinarian has a lot of good advice about pet ownership. Fish can be very rewarding as pets, and you just may be surprised about how much fish actually interact with their owners. Here’s more valuable information about choosing and owning pet fish.

## **Saltwater vs. Freshwater**

The first decision you’ll need to make is whether to buy saltwater or freshwater fish. Saltwater fish are more delicate and need an experienced owner in order to thrive. As a new fish owner, you should start off with freshwater fish. They are much easier to care for and require less starter equipment. There is a wide range of freshwater fish to choose from, so your tank will be just as interesting and varied as a saltwater tank would be.

## **What to Know About Fish**

Fish are very susceptible to shock. Even moving them from the water from the pet store into your aquarium takes time and patience. Your pet fish need to slowly climate to the water temperature and environment. Your veterinarian can help you learn the steps you’ll need to take to ensure that the transition goes smoothly.

Your fish tank should be placed on a stable surface where it won’t be accidentally knocked or tipped over. If you have other pets, try to place the tank where they can’t get to it. Place your tank in an active area of your home. Your fish will enjoy watching you and your family as you go about your daily activities. This stimulation is important to the happiness of your pet fish, even though their brains won’t really register what’s actually taking place.

## **Keeping Fish Together**

You’ll want to have several fish in your tank. But some fish are predatory. You don’t want to put any of your pet fish at risk from newcomers to the tank. Consult with your veterinarian about which freshwater fish can be safely kept together in one tank.

## **Feeding Pet Fish**

Not all freshwater fish eat the same thing. You can’t just buy one jar of pet fish food and expect your fish to thrive. Be sure you know what each of your pet fish eats so that you can provide everything that’s needed. Also, fish will readily overeat, so make sure you don’t overfeed your pet fish.

Owning fish can be fun and fulfilling, as you can see. Now that you know the basics of pet fish ownership, it’s time to go out and choose your fish and accessories!
