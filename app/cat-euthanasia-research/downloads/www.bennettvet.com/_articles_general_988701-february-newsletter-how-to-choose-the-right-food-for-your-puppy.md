**How to Choose the Right Food for Your Puppy**

A healthy diet is essential to your puppy's growth and development. Wondering what to feed your new pet? These tips can help you find the ideal type of food for your pet.

**Buy Food Specifically Intended for Puppies**

Dog food intended for adult dogs won't meet your puppy's nutritional needs. Puppies need higher amounts of protein, calcium, fat, and other nutrients than older dogs do. Puppy food should contain at least 22.5% protein and 8.5% fat, according to the Association of American Feed Control Officers (AAFCO). In contrast, adult dog food meets AAFCO guidelines with only 18% protein and 5.5% fat.

Your puppy's health may suffer if doesn't receive the proper mix of nutrients, vitamins, and minerals. A diet low in protein or fat can lead to slow growth, weak muscles, and frequent illnesses. Low levels of calcium could affect the normal development of your pet's bones and teeth and cause muscle spasms, weakness, fatigue, and seizures.

**Take a Look at Ingredients**

Protein, like beef, poultry, or fish, should be one of the first ingredients listed on the back of a can or box of puppy food. Although it's best to avoid foods with a high percentage of fillers, grains and byproducts are perfectly safe ingredients for your furry friend, according to the American Kennel Club.

The AKC notes that grains provide nutrients, while animal byproducts, like organ meat and entrails, often contain more nutrients than the meat you eat. Of course, if your puppy is allergic to grains, it's best to avoid them. Grain allergy symptoms include itchy, red skin, frequent ear infections, inflamed paw pads, hair loss due to excessive scratching, or biting, diarrhea, gas, and vomiting.

**Look for the Seal of Approval**

Food that meets AAFCO requirements will include a statement that notes the "product is formulated to meet the nutritional levels established by the AAFCO Dog Food Nutrition Profiles." If you see this statement, the food offers a complete and balanced diet and will meet your puppy's nutritional needs.

**Consider Breed and Adult Size**

A generic puppy formula may not be a good idea if you have a small or large breed puppy. These foods may not meet the unique needs of large or small pets, even if the food is intended for consumption by puppies. The AKC notes that large-breed puppies need a precise mix of nutrients to prevent muscle and bone problems. Small dogs also have different nutritional needs and may choke on dry food if the pieces are too large. Fortunately, many manufacturers offer foods specially designed for large and small breed puppies.

**Think About the Type of Food Your Puppy Will Eat**

Do you plan on feeding your puppy dry food, wet food, or a mix of both kinds of food? Dry food stays fresh longer and helps keep your dog's teeth clean. Wet food has a higher water content and a variety of flavors that appeal to puppies, but must be refrigerated after opening. Food choice is an individual decision based on a variety of factors, including your puppy's preferences, convenience, food storage availability, and your budget.

**Talk to Your Veterinarian About the Best Food for Your Puppy**

With so many brands and types of puppy food available, choosing the right food for your pet might not be as easy as you imagined. Fortunately, your pet's veterinarian can offer advice and recommend foods that will help your puppy grow and thrive. Your veterinarian is also a good source of information about specialty diets for health conditions and can suggest appropriate foods or prescription diets.

Has your new puppy seen the veterinarian yet? In addition to providing food recommendations, your pet's veterinarian also offers vaccines that will help your furry friend stay healthy. Contact our office to schedule an appointment for your puppy.
