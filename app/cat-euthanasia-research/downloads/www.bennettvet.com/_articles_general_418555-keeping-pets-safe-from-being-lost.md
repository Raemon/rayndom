  * Keeping Pets Safe from Being Lost



## Keeping Pets Safe from Being Lost

  * Created in Newsletter Library, Pet Dangers 



An estimated one third of all pets will become lost at some point in their life. Reasons for pets becoming lost include everything from a loose gate to breaking free from a leash. With so many possible ways for a pet to become lost, it is important to follow some simple safety procedures.

**Dog Tags (Identification Tags)**   
Keep an up-to-date "dog-tag" on your pet's collar, even when they are in the house. The first place someone who finds your pet will look for information is the collar. If your pet escapes the house, you will want them to have their collar on them with their information.

If necessary, make up more than one identification tag to include all of your pet's information. This includes your address, your phone number, work number, cell number, or any other number you have that will reach a member of your family. Other information should include our information as your pet's veterinarian (which is included on all rabies tags.) You do not need to include your pet's name on the tag. There are people who steal pets and this might offer them a chance to lure your pet. Place the word "REWARD" on all tags where you would place your pet's name.

**Tattoos and Microchips**   
One method of finding out information about a pet is through micro chipping. A microchip is a specialized information holder inserted under the skin in your pets back. When scanned, the chip will give the scanner all of your pet's information, including information on their humans and how to return your pet. Most veterinarians and shelters have these specialized scanners, though if someone else finds your pet, they will have to locate someone with a scanner before you will be contacted.

Because not everyone owns a microchip scanner, some pet owners opt to have their pet tattooed. The tattoo is placed, while your pet is under anesthesia, on the inside of their thigh or in their ear. An identification number and a phone number of a pet registry are tattooed.

If you find a lost animal, lay them down on their side and examine them for a tattoo. It might be necessary to trim some of the hair that has grown over the tattoo. Contact us if you find a pet and cannot read the tattoo.

**Always Use a Leash**   
Unless you are in a fenced in yard, always use a leash when traveling anywhere with your pet. Your pet might be well behaved, but they may forget the rules if they see something interesting in the distance, such as another animal.

**Keep Cats Indoors**   
Unlike their K-9 counterparts, cats can jump fences and climb trees. For this reason, cats should be kept as an indoor pet. It is best to teach your cat to stay indoors when they are young. Older cats can get confused and forget the way home.

Pets are a part of the family. Taking precautions and keeping an eye on your pet will help keep them safe at home.
