**The Benefits of Laser Therapy for Pets**

Medication isn't the only option if your pet experiences pain and inflammation. Laser therapy offers a safe, effective, drug-free pain management method. Laser therapy eases pain from injuries and may improve the quality of life for pets that struggle with chronic conditions.

**What Is Laser Therapy?**

Laser therapy uses laser light to trigger positive changes in your pet's tissues and cells. During a process called photobiomodulation, laser light is absorbed by living tissues. This absorption leads to pain relief, reduced inflammation, and faster tissues healing. 

During therapy sessions, your veterinarian aims a handheld laser device at specific areas of your pet's body. Treatments are short and may only take 10 to 30 minutes. In most cases, your pet will need more than one laser therapy treatment. If your furry friend has a chronic condition, regularly scheduled laser therapy will help keep pain and inflammation under control.

**What Are the Advantages of Laser Therapy?**

Laser therapy offers these benefits for your pet:

  * **An Effective Pain Relief Option.** Laser therapy helps your pet's body release endorphins, hormones that dull pain naturally. The therapy has no side effects and can improve your pet's comfort. Your pet may be able to decrease pain medication or stop taking it completely after laser therapy. Researchers evaluated the effects of low-level laser therapy in dogs with osteoarthritis in a research study published in Open Veterinary Journal in 2020. Pain inventory scores decreased significantly after the first laser treatment and continued to decrease with additional treatments.
  * **Less Inflammation and Swelling.** Inflammation is common after surgery or an injury and may also be an issue if your pet has a chronic condition, like arthritis or hip dysplasia. In addition to causing pain, inflammation leads to swelling and stiffness. Laser therapy decreases inflammation by boosting blood circulation and helping the lymph system remove waste.
  * **Quicker Healing.** Laser therapy helps wounds heal and can shorten your pet's recovery from injuries and surgery. Laser therapy speeds tissue regrowth and improves the production of collagen, a protein that repairs damaged tissues. According to Today's Veterinary Practice, laser therapy increases the release of pro-healing cytokines and speeds the development of new bone.
  * **Improved Mobility.** Has a joint condition or disease slowed down your once-playful pet? Laser therapy decreases stiffness and pain, making it easier for your pet to move. Thanks to laser therapy, walking up the stairs or going for a walk may become much easier.
  * **A Good Choice for Chronic Conditions.** Laser therapy isn't just a good choice for wounds and injuries. It can also be used to control the symptoms of painful chronic conditions. Laser therapy is a good choice if your pet has pain caused by arthritis, dysplasia, neuromuscular disease, or other diseases and conditions.
  * **An Alternative to Pain Medication.** Pain medication isn't the best choice for all pets. Some can't take pain medication due to underlying conditions, while others can't tolerate the side effects of these medicines. Thanks to the pain-relieving benefits of laser therapy, your pet doesn't suffer if it can't take medication.



**What Conditions Does Laser Therapy Help?**

Laser therapy can be a good choice for:

  * Arthritis
  * Disc Disease
  * Neuromuscular Disease
  * Back Pain
  * Soft Tissue Wounds
  * Ear Infections
  * Muscle Strains and Sprains
  * Hip Dysplasia
  * Broken Bones
  * Bite Wounds
  * Tendon and Ligament Injuries
  * Skin Sores and Open Wounds
  * Inflammatory Bowel Disease
  * Healing After Surgery or Dental Procedures
