## Territory our Mobile Veterinary Service Covers

Dr. Bennett's Mobile Veterinary service delivers quality veterinary care on a house call or mobile basis throughout Contra Costa County and Alameda County. We perform in-home pet euthanasia and also provide outpatient medical services and wellness. Because of our central location on the Contra Costa and Alameda county border near El Sobrante we can perform vet house calls to most of the East Bay Area. Dr. Bennett was raised in the Walnut Creek and the Concord area thus most of our clients live in the Walnut Creek and Berkeley corridor which includes towns like Orinda and Lafayette, Alamo and Pleasant Hill. As displayed on Google Places we will travel out in a radius of twenty from Walnut Creek. This includes towns like Hercules, Pinole, El Sobrante, and Vallejo in West Contra Costa County extending to Pitsburg in Eastern Contra Costa County. We cover the northwestern part of Alameda County which includes Oakland to El Cerrito and Albany.
