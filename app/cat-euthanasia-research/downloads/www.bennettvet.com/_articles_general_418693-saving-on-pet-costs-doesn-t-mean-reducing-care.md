  * Saving On Pet Costs Doesn't Mean Reducing Care



## Saving On Pet Costs Doesn't Mean Reducing Care

  * Created in Newsletter Library, Visiting the Vet 



Having a pet can cost owners hard earned money. There are food costs, recreation or pet-sitting costs, grooming fees and veterinary visits. When you want to save on the dollars you spend keeping your family's pets healthy and well remember that reducing their care is not the first choice to make. Reducing care usually means reducing veterinary visits, omitting recommendations veterinarians make, delaying vaccinations, dental care or surgery, or purchasing nutrient-lacking foods and reduced-quality medications. It is possible to maintain your pet's well being and save on pet care costs.

**Quality Foods  
** Veterinary Secrets Revealed by veterinarian Andrew Jones asks, "What is going in your Pet's Mouth? After surgical procedures, food is the second most expensive item for pet owners. Individually, Americans spend about $250 a year on food for their pets making it a $15 billion industry. I firmly believe that a big key to avoid the excess veterinary expenses is by feeding your pet the best quality food you can. Diet is a big key to a healthy pet. The healthier the pet the more you save on vet costs."

**Multiple Pet Discount  
** Multiple pet discounts are often offered at veterinary clinics and offices. Owners must ask about the discounts and their availability. Remember that office policies in pet care establishments can change occasionally. Be kindly consistent in asking if multiple pet discounts are available. If this discount is not provided at your current veterinarian's office, ask that the doctor consider it for patients and families in the community.

**Senior Discount  
** Reduced fees or discounted pet services for senior citizens are often offered at veterinarian offices. It's a good idea to ask when you schedule your appointment if this discount is available to you. The discount may be recognized on a "by request only" basis. This means you probably won't see a notice about it posted anywhere when you visit the office for vaccinations, check ups or food purchases.

**Vaccinations**   
Vaccinations must be maintained on a regular basis for your pet's best health. Sometimes vaccinations may be reduced or delayed due to your pet's health. Your veterinarian can help you recognize circumstances that may require delaying, omitting or reducing vaccinations for your pet. Talk with your veterinarian in advance about the consequences or any problems that could arise if recommended shots are not given.

**Medications**   
Your pet may require medications on an on-going basis or after a surgical procedure. Medications can be conveniently purchased at your veterinarian's office while you are attending a visit with the doctor. If you want to save on the cost of medications for your pet, talk about it during your visit with the doctor. Medications are oftentimes readily available through Internet purchases and discount Websites. Your vet will help you make informed decisions about these purchases before you make them. Your veterinarian will also help you avoid providing medications for your pet that are sub-standard in quality. You'll also want to be sure the dosages of reduced cost or discounted medications will meet your pet's needs.
