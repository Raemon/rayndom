We are committed to educating our clients on how to keep their pets healthy year-round, with preventative care, good nutrition and exercise. Dr. Bennett's Veterinary House Calls above all, is dedicated to the comfort and wellbeing of your pet.   


Dr. Bennett spent the first 13 years of his career working in local hospitals practicing medicine and surgery. Over the years of working in the hospital, Dr. Bennett noted that in many cases, pets coming to the veterinary hospital became highly stressed, sometimes to the point of having a crisis. In 2010 Dr. Bennett started working as a mobile Veterinarian in Walnut Creek, Berkeley, Oakland, and surrounding areas. Dr. Bennett quickly realized that a mobile veterinary practice allowed him to have a more personal relationship with his clients. He also noticed the stress level among pets was minimal on a house call basis. Dr. Bennett has practiced as a mobile veterinarian for over 12 years, and thousands of pets have benefited from the personal and caring touch of a house call.

DR. ANDERSON PUT NEW LIFE IN MY BODYWhen I first started going to Dr. Anderson I was in great pain with my back. It started by slipping and throwing my back out. There’s just one thing I can say before I got help from Dr. Anderson is I was one miserable lady. I tried heating pads, cold packs and even salves to help my problem and all of them were unsuccessful. I heard a lot of Dr. Anderson from his TV advertising. I picked him myself and I am so glad I did! Dr. Anderson

I’M ALMOST AS GOOD AS NEWBefore coming to see Dr. Anderson and his wonderful staff, I had fallen on the ice a couple of times and injured my lower back. I had extreme lower back pain, particularly on the right, with lower leg/toe numbness and tingling. I was kind of dealing with the pain until one morning I was bending over to feed my dog and the pain shot through me. It was so bad I could hardly move. I had tried a physical therapist but it didn’t help at all. I heard about D

**L.S.**

My problem was my lower back, It kept going out and I had been suffering off and on for years. It started at work. I pulled two discs out, my 4th and 5th vertebra. I found out about Dr. Anderson through our new work insurance. On my first visit, Dr. Anderson took some x-rays and treated my back with very nice treatments. Dr. Anderson told me that a few discs were out in my lower back. Dr. Anderson improved my life as my problem is gone now, I feel great and I hope it stays that way. H

## Dr. Bennett provides the following   
mobile veterinary services in security of your pet's home. 

**Physical Exam**

Because our pets have shorter life spans than humans the onset and progression of disease can be very subtle and undetectable to most caretakers. Dr. Bennett examines your pet in the comfort of its home with superb bedside manner. Your pet's health can be more accurately assessed under these conditions because clinical signs of disease are not masked by the adrenaline surge caused by traveling to the veterinary hospital. A more accurate physical exam is one of the most valuable benefits of utilizing Dr. Bennett's Mobile Vet Service.

**Pet Wellness and Disease Prevention**

Vaccines, parasite control and disease prevention are a very important part of insuring your pet healthy. Dogs and cats constantly have their noses to the ground consuming contaminated dirt and feces. By nature, many pets hunt small prey which may harbor transmissible parasitic, viral and bacterial disease. Furthermore, our pets all have their own predispositions for particular genetic or breed specific diseases and conditions. It is crucial to have your pet examined by a veterinarian on a regular basis and to employ the appropriate testing, vaccines and prophylactics to prevent disease. Dr. Bennett's Veterinary House Call Service utilizes the most modern and cutting edge technology to make sure your pet is safe, healthy and happy.

**Pet Euthanasia**

When it is time to say goodbye to your pet, Dr. Bennett will make sure the transition is peaceful, painless and dignified. A mobile vet. service eliminates the trip to the veterinary hospital and allows your pet to have a comfortable passing which is the definition of euthanasia. Dr. Bennett's Mobile Veterinary Service uses the best sedatives and delivers superb bedside manner to make sure euthanasia is smooth and immediate. Dr. Bennett's Mobile Veterinary Service will provide cremation services that include private cremation with return of ashes and general cremation with no ashes returned. 

**Itchy Pet - Skin Problems**

Many dogs and cats suffer with constant or intermittent itching. Dr. Bennett is a veterinarian that believes in giving itchy pets instant relief and permanently resolving the problem by utilizing advanced treatment modalities and diagnostics. As a mobile vet., Dr. Bennett can evaluate your pet's living environment to help determine what the cause may be.

**Illness**

Vomiting, diarrhea, excessive thirst, increased urination, lethargy, coughing and weight loss are all signs a pet is ill. Dr. Bennett's Mobile Veterinary service offers blood work up, dna testing, blood pressure, biopsy, cytology and other diagnostic procedures which will be completed in your pet's home. Dr. Bennett's Veterinary Service uses the top of the line laboratories , specialists and equipment to make sure your pet receives the best veterinary care possible. 

**Cuts, Abscesses, Contusions**

Most minor injuries can be handled at home using a mobile veterinary services. Dr. Bennett uses sedation and local anesthesia (numbing) to suture lacerations, drain abscesses, resolve hot spots and to rectify other unfortunate mishaps. 

**Surgery**

As a mobile vet., Dr. Bennett will only perform minor surgical procedures such as skin biopsy, laceration repair and abscess drainage. Dr. Bennett refers major or invasive surgical procedures to the best local specialists or U.C Davis. The option to have the patients regular hospital veterinarian perform surgical or imaging procedures is often a good choice. Dr. Bennett has worked as an on call veterinarian for the veterinary hospitals in Contra Costa County and Alameda County and therefore, in most cases already has a working relationship with your regular hospital veterinarian. 

**Pet Behavior Problems**

Pet behavior problems can often cause great harm to the human pet relationship. Separation anxiety, inappropriate urination and obsessive compulsive licking are only a few of the many. Caretakers often misunderstand the cause of these problems and become frustrated when attempts to rectify the issues fail. These problems often have solutions through behavior modification and possible pharmaceutical intervention. Dr. Bennett believes it is crucial that behavior consultation take place at the pet's home so that environmental circumstances surrounding the problem can be fully considered. Dr. Bennett will educate you thoroughly and make a plan to bring everything back to normal.

**Chronic Disease and Geriatric care**

Unfortunately, some of us must live with problems we were born with or acquire as we grow older. Dr. Bennett will provide you with all the knowledge and services to make your pet as comfortable, productive, and happy as possible. Oftentimes diagnostics performed by a mobile vet in home to monitor your pet's condition are more accurate, and treatment regimens can be more successful without the stress of going back and forth to the veterinary hospital.
