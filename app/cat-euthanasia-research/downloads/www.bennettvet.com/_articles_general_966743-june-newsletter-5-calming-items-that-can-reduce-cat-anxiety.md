**5 Calming Items That Can Reduce Cat Anxiety**

Do you wish you could find a way to soothe your anxious kitty? These five products could turn your frightened feline into a calm, contented cat.

**Pheromone Diffusers**

Pheromone diffusers release a calming pheromone spray that helps your anxious cat relax. Pheromones are natural chemicals released by glands in various parts of your cat's body. These chemicals help your cat communicate with other cats, mark their territory, and offer a natural way to calm frayed nerves.

Diffusers use manmade pheromones that act just like natural ones. Pheromone spray may reduce stress-related behaviors, like hiding, scratching, and urine spraying. Some manufacturers also offer multi-cat diffusers that can be helpful if there's tension between the cats in your family. The diffusers plug into outlets and cover up to 700 square feet. Feliway, Sentry, bSerene, Therapet, Woyamay and other companies sell pheromone diffusers.

**Calming Treats**

Calming your cat may be as simple as feeding it a special treat. Simply offer the treats 30 minutes before a trip to the veterinarian, a long car ride, during a thunderstorm, or in any other situation that stresses your kitty. Treats can be offered daily or as needed and won't make your cat lethargic. Treats contain natural ingredients, like L-theanine and thiamine, that reduce stress and anxiety, help your cat feel calm, and improve its mood. Among the companies that sell calming treats are Vetriscience, Pet Naturals, Pet Honest, Zesty Paws and Cat MX.

**ThunderShirt**

ThunderShirts have helped plenty of dogs deal with anxiety caused by fireworks and thunder and can be just as effective for cats. If sleeping under a weighted blanket makes you feel safe and secure, just imagine how helpful a ThunderShirt can be for cats. The weighted ThunderShirt wraps around your furry friend's body, providing gentle, consistent pressure that induces a sense of calm.

ThunderShirts can be worn daily for general anxiety or placed on your cat before a potentially stressful event. The shirts are available in sizes small, medium and large.

**Calming Cat Food**

Several manufacturers, including Royal Canin and Hill's, offer cat food designed to relieve anxiety. The specialty food can be helpful if you're cat is dealing with a stressful situation, like a move, a new baby, or the death of a family member or pet. Feeding your pet calming cat food may be particularly helpful if your cat is experiencing digestive issues, urinary problems, or irritated skin due to stress and anxiety. Royal Canin's Calm Dry Cat Food contains hydrolyzed milk protein and L-tryptophan, ingredients that reduce stress. The food is also enriched with fiber to keep hairballs under control.

**Cat Collar**

Similar to diffusers, anti-stress collars constantly emit pheromones that help your furry friend feel relaxed and content. The collars release pheromones for up to 30 days, and unlike diffusers, can be used anywhere. They may make car trips less stressful, could help your cat adjust to the presence of a new pet, or reduce scratching or spraying behaviors. Several manufacturers, including Comfort Zone, Alzoo, Sentry and Relaxivet, offer calming collars.

**Things to Keep in Mind About Calming Products**

You may need to try several products before you find the best option for your pet. Although anti-anxiety products can be helpful, they may not completely eliminate anxiety. If your cat is struggling with stress and anxiety, let your veterinarian know. He or she can recommend strategies and treatments that will ease your pet's symptoms.
