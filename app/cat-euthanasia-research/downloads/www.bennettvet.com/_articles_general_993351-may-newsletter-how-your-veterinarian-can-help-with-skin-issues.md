**How Your Veterinarian Can Help with Your Pet's Skin Issues**

Itchy skin, hot spots, and open sores can be signs your pet has a skin problem. Luckily, your veterinarian offers treatments that will soothe irritated skin and keep skin issues under control.

**Skin Conditions in Pets**

Skin conditions are a common problem for our furry friends. Skin issues are among the top 10 reasons both dogs and cats visit veterinarians, according to Nationwide, a pet insurance company.

Common skin issues in pets include:

  * **Allergic Dermatitis.** Itching, hair loss, and ear infections can be signs of allergic dermatitis. Your pet may scratch its skin constantly as it attempts to stop the itching. Unfortunately, frequent scratching can lead to red, open sores called hot spots. In dogs, hot spots are often found on the legs, hips, and head, according to dvm360. Allergic dermatitis can be caused by allergies to food, flea saliva, pollen, dust, mold, or mites.
  * **Dry Skin.** Dry skin causes itching, dandruff, scaly skin, scabs, pimples, and odor. Human shampoo and some pet shampoos can dry out your pet's skin. The American Kennel Club recommends buying shampoo that includes moisturizing ingredients, like aloe vera, coconut oil, and vitamins B and E. Dry skin can be caused by low humidity, diet, infections, parasites, and some diseases, including Cushing's disease and hypothyroidism.
  * **Mange.** Tiny mites feast on your pet's skin, causing hair loss, sores, scabs, and inflammation in dogs, cats, rabbits, and small animals. Demodectic mange primarily affects dogs, while sarcoptic mange can affect dogs, cats, rabbits, hamsters, gerbils, and guinea pigs.
  * **Feline Acne**. Blackheads or red pimples on your cat's chin could mean your pet has feline acne. Feline acne occurs when the pores become blocked by keratin, a protein found in skin. Risk factors for feline acne include poor grooming, immune system or hormonal issues, food allergies, stress, and contact allergies, according to WebMD.
  * **Yeast Infections.** Yeast overgrowth can cause red, inflamed, flaky skin, and severe itching. A greasy coat and skin, hair loss, sores, crusts, and thicker, darker skin are signs of yeast infections. Infections often develop in the ears, armpits, between the toes, and in skin folds in the face, groin, and other areas.
  * **Ringworm.** Contrary to its name, ringworm is caused by a fungal infection, not worms. The infection gets its name from the raised, red, circular bumps that form on the skin. Ringworm affects dogs, cats, rabbits, mice, hamsters, gerbils, and guinea pigs. Symptoms include hair loss, itching, and scaly skin.



**Treatment Options for Skin Conditions**

Not sure which skin condition your pet has? Identifying a skin condition isn't always easy, as many conditions cause similar symptoms. In addition to examining the skin, your veterinarian may also use skin scrapings, fungal cultures, and other tests to diagnose your pet's skin condition. Depending on the diagnosis, one or more of these treatments may be helpful.

  * **Medications to Control Itching**. Antihistamines and corticosteroids may be prescribed to relieve itching. Antihistamines block histamine, a chemical that causes allergy symptoms. Corticosteroids calm the immune system and decrease itching. If itching is severe, your veterinarian may recommend immunomodulatory medications. These medications work with your pet's immune system to attack proteins that cause itching.
  * **Dietary Changes.** Hypoallergenic food could ease allergic dermatitis symptoms caused by food allergies. Allergy shots may be helpful if your pet's skin problems are caused by environmental allergens.
  * **Skin-Soothing Products.** Your veterinarian may recommend prescription medications or non-prescription products that make your pet feel more comfortable. Shampoos, dips, creams, and other topical products relieve itching and improve the condition of your furry friend's skin.
  * **Antibiotics.** Antibiotics may be prescribed if your pet has open sores that become infected. The drugs also treat tick-borne diseases, including Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever.
  * **Other Medications.** Topical and oral antifungal medications treat ringworm and yeast infections, while anti-parasitic medications kill mites and other parasites.
  * **Flea and Tick Control Products.** Year-round flea and tick control will help your pet avoid allergic dermatitis and potentially deadly tick-borne diseases. Collars, oral medication, and topical products applied to the skin offer a simple way to protect your pet's health.
