**How to Bathe Your Kitten**

Although adult cats usually have grooming mastered, kittens may occasionally need a little help. Bathing your kitty doesn't have to be a stressful experience when you keep these tips in mind.

**Know When Your Kitten Needs a Bath**

Your bundle of fur may need a thorough cleaning due to:

  * **A Sticky Situation.** Your pet may not be able to remove sticky substances, mud, or dirt by grooming alone. A bath will keep your pet's fur clean and comfortable.
  * **Exposure to Dangerous Substances.** A bath is a must if your cat's fur absorbed a cleaning product, oil, antifreeze, or another potentially toxic substance. An emergency bath will prevent your pet from ingesting harmful poisons and toxins by licking its fur.
  * **Skin Conditions.** Some kittens need baths to keep skin conditions, like allergic dermatitis or fungal infections, under control.
  * **Grooming Issues.** If your kitten struggles with grooming, a bath will remove unpleasant odors and keep your pet's fur in good condition.
  * **Fleas.** Bathing with soapy water removes fleas and flea dirt that could irritate your pet's skin. Flea baths and other flea products can be toxic to kittens. Check with your veterinarian before using any flea product on your kitten.



**Create a Positive First Impression**

Help your kitten adjust to bathing by gently rubbing a warm, moist washcloth over its body. Your pet will be more likely to decide bathing is a positive experience if you offer a few treats. During this stage, moisten the washcloth with water, but don't use soap or shampoo.

**Get Rid of Tangles**

Before you begin your kitten's first bath, brush your its fur thoroughly. Gentle brushing removes tangles, mats, loose hair, and dirt and is an important pre-bath step.

**Prepare the Bath**

After your kitten becomes comfortable with being wet, it's time to shift from a quick swipe of the washcloth to an actual bath. Prepare the bath by adding an inch or two of lukewarm water to a small basin or sink. If the water is too hot or cold, your kitten may be uncomfortable and become uncooperative. Keep the room warm to avoid chills. Put a towel or mat in the bottom of the basin or sink to prevent slipping.

**Place Your Kitten in the Water**

After you put your pet in the water, give it a few minutes to get used to this new experience. Treats and bath toys offers distractions that may make bathing more pleasant for your kitten.

Offer words of encouragement and praise during the bath. If your kitten isn't cooperative, end the bath and try again another day. Forcing your pet to participate in bathing or losing your patience with your kitten may make it fear future baths.

**Apply the Shampoo**

Use a small cup to wet your kitten's fur, then apply a small amount of shampoo. PetMD advises using shampoo specifically made for kittens, as your shampoo can dry or irritate your pet's sensitive skin. Shampoo should be used on your kitten's body starting at the neck and ending at the tail.

**Clean Your Pet's Face**

Use a moistened washcloth or cotton ball to clean your pet's face ears. You'll only need water for this step, as shampoo can irritate your pet's eyes.

**Rinse Your Kitten**

Fill a small cup with warm bath water and rinse your pet's fur. Make sure all the soapy residue is gone before ending the bath.

**Dry Your Pet**

Wrap your kitten in a towel and gently pat its fur to dry it. Keep your pet away from vents and open windows when towel drying. If your kitten doesn't object, you can also use a hair dryer. The National Kitten Coalition recommends using the dryer on a low setting to prevent burns.
