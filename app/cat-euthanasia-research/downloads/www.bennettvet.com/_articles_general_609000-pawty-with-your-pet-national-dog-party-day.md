  * Pawty with Your Pet - National Dog Party Day



## Pawty with Your Pet - National Dog Party Day

  * Created in Newsletter Library, Seasonal Topics 



**Pawty with Your Pet on National Dog Party Day**

Is your motto "the more parties, the better?" Then you'll want to circle June 21 on your calendar. The third Saturday in June is this year's National Dog Party Day, a special celebration for dogs young and old, big and small. Check out these ideas for ways to celebrate.

**Throw a Party**

Invite a few of your pooch's canine friends for the ultimate dog party. When you plan your party, think about:

**The Venue.** Will you hold the party in your backyard, at a local dog park or another venue? If you plan to throw a party at your home, make sure your fence is in good condition. Designate a special potty area for guests in an out-of-the-way corner of your yard and provide pooper scoopers and bags.

**The Guests.** How many humans and dogs will you invite? Just like human parties, dog parties are most successful if the guests get along. It's best to leave aggressive dogs or those that aren't well socialized off the guest list. Be sure that your pet meets all of the dogs you plan to invite well in advance of the party. If your dog prefers people to pets, there's no reason why your furry friend can't be the only dog at the party.

**The Theme.** Although a theme isn't necessary, it can make the party more fun. Dogs can wear their favorite bandanas or come dressed in costumes. Your human guests will probably enjoy dressing in outfits that complement their dogs' costumes.

**The Refreshments.** What will you serve your four-legged and two-legged guests? A selection of tasty appetizers followed by a dog-shaped cake might impress the humans, but what about the dogs? Pinterest has plenty of recipes that are perfect for dog parties, including peanut butter bacon donuts, homemade dog biscuits and watermelon popsicles.

**The Entertainment.** What's a party without games and activities? The American Kennel Club has a few recommendations. The Club suggests creating a bouncy pit just for your canine guests, adding snacks to buckets filled with waters for a bobbing game, or hiding dog toys filled with treats throughout the yard. If the weather is warm, the dogs might enjoy wading in a kiddie pool or running through a sprinkler.

If you're still practicing social distancing in June, there's no reason that you can't throw a small dog party with just your family and your pets in attendance. Invite friends or family members to check in with FaceTime or teleconferencing apps. Consider holding a virtual dog party by encouraging your friends to post videos of their own celebrations on social media.

**Other Ways to Celebrate National Dog Pawty Day**

  * **Devote to the Day to Your Pet.** Make National Dog Pawty day all about your dog. Brush or bathe him, offer his or her favorite treats and spend the entire afternoon playing fetch, throwing a frisbee, going for a walk or engaging in other favorite activities.



On National Dog Pawty Day, and every day, we're here to help you care for your pet. Call us if you would like to schedule an appointment for your dog or just have a question.
