  * Cat Backpacks: The New Trend in Feline Transportation



## Cat Backpacks: The New Trend in Feline Transportation

  * Created in Newsletter Library, Cats 



**Why are Cat Backpacks All the Rage?**

Thanks to specially designed backpacks, cat carriers are no longer the only pet transport option. Cat backpacks just may make trips more pleasant for you and your cat.

**Backpacks Offer Comfort and Convenience**

Pet carriers help you get your cat from one place to another, but they aren't always the most comfortable choice for either of you. A simple change in position can send your cat skittering from one end of the carrier to the other as you desperately fight to keep the carrier level. Holding the carrier with one arm can strain the muscles in your arm and neck, particularly if your cat is large or could stand to lose a few pounds.

Cat backpacks eliminate both of those issues. The packs distribute weight evenly over your back and don't move even if your furry friend decides to turn around. Padded straps keep the back firmly in place without digging into your shoulders. Many backpacks also include waist or chest straps to ensure that the back doesn't bounce or move while you wear it.

Backpacks are ideal if you want to take your pet for a walk around the neighborhood or make the trip to the veterinarian's office for your cat's checkup.

**Specially Designed Backpacks Provide Plenty of Ventilation**

You're probably wondering how your pet will breathe in a backpack. Cat backpacks aren't exactly like the standard backpacks you use to hold books or your laptop. Some packs feature mesh screens that allow your cat to view its surroundings and get a little fresh air. The fabric packs are lightweight yet offer plenty of room for your furry friend.

Others offer transparent bubbles that give your pet a clear view of the world. These packs contain ample ventilation openings for easy breathing and feature soft inner liners and waterproof exteriors for your cat's comfort. Bubble backpacks are made of polycarbonate, the same material used to make hard-shell luggage.

**How to Convince Your Cat to Use a Backpack**

A cat backpack may sound like a good idea to you, but will your pet agree with your opinion? Most likely, it will take your cat a little time to adjust riding in the backpack. A slow, steady approach is the key to convincing your pet that the backpack offers an excellent way to see the world.

These tips can help speed the adjustment process:

  * **Choose the Correct Size.** Your pet won't enjoy riding in the backpack if it's too small. Your cat should be able to stand and turn around easily in the backpack while you're wearing it.
  * **Start Slowly.** Put your new backpack on the floor and let your cat sniff it. Your pet may be more interested in the pack if you wear it a few times to ensure that it contains your scent.
  * **Offer a Reward.** Hide a few treats in the inner compartment of the backpack to encourage your feline friend to spend a few minutes inside. After he or she willingly spends a little time inside the backpack, close the opening for a few minutes.
  * **Try Short Walks.** Once your cat is comfortable in the backpack, walk around your house or yard. Be sure to offer a treat or two at the end of the walk.
  * **Hit the Road.** Gradually increase the time your pet spends in the backpack. As your cat becomes more comfortable riding in the pack, you can use it for hikes, bike rides, or air travel. If you plan to keep your pet in the backpack for several hours, bring water along and offer frequent breaks. Attach a harness to your pet to keep him or her safe during food and water breaks.



Veterinary visits can be stressful for cats due to the unfamiliar sights, sounds, and smells. Backpacks may enhance feelings of safety and security and help your pet feel less anxious during visits. Vet visits offer the perfect opportunity to try out your new backpack. If it's time for pet's next visit, contact us to schedule a convenient appointment.
