**How to Properly Care for Your New Pet**

Welcoming a new pet to your home is an exciting time. Whether your new addition is a dog, cat, or hamster, familiarizing yourself with pet care basics will help you provide a comfortable, happy home for your new pet.

**Caring for Your New Dog**

Stock up on the basics before bringing your dog home. Your dog will need:

  * Food and Water Dishes
  * A Bed
  * Toys
  * Collar
  * ID tag
  * Brush
  * Crate



Establishing a routine will help your dog adjust to its new home. Feed your pet at the same time every day. Choose food intended for your pet's age. Puppy food is specially formulated to provide the extra calories and nutrients puppies need, while adult and senior foods are best for older dogs. The American Kennel Club suggests feeding adult dogs twice a day. Puppies and large breeds may need more frequent meals.

Consider crate training your new pet. A crate becomes your pet's safe space and can make housetraining easier. When your pet is in the crate, it will learn how to hold its bladder, as it won't want to soil its den. Puppies have small bladders and can only stay in crates for brief periods of time initially. Older dogs can remain in crates for several hours but shouldn't spend the majority of the day crated.

Set aside time every day for walks or outdoor time. Although exercise requirements vary depending on breed, health, and age, all dogs need to stay active. If your dog is a puppy or hasn't exercised regularly in the past, start with short walks and gradually increase exercise time.

Expect a few housetraining accidents, even if your new dog is older. It takes a while for your pet to learn the rules and routines of a new household. Take your pet outside to relieve itself first thing in the morning, before bed, and after meals, playtime, and naps.

**Caring for Your New Cat**

Cat must-haves include the following:

  * Food and Water Dishes
  * Litter Box
  * Scratching Posts
  * Toys
  * Brush
  * Bed
  * Collar
  * ID Tag



Put the litter box in a quiet place away from your cat's food and water dishes. Remove clumps from clumping litter daily. Replace non-clumping litter every week.

Just like dogs, cats need food appropriate for their age. Fortunately, it's easy to find kitten, adult, and senior cat food at supermarkets and pet stores. The Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine recommends this feeding schedule for cats:

  * Up to 6 Months: Three Meals Per Day
  * 6 Months to 1 Year: Two Meals Per Day
  * 1 Year and Older: One or Two Meals Per Day



A selection of interesting toys will keep your cat's mind and body active. Kitty fishing rods and battery-operated mice indulge your pet's love of stalking and capturing prey, while puzzle feeders offer a tasty treat once your cat solves the puzzle. Cat tunnels and condos and cardboard boxes offer stimulation and hiding places for your pet.

**Caring for Your Small Animal**

Are you welcoming a rabbit, hamster, gerbil, guinea pig, or other small animal into your home? Before you bring your pet home, make sure you have a cage big enough for sleeping and playing. The ideal cage varies depending on the pet, but should include a sipper water bottle, food dish, pet-safe bedding, and an enclosed section that provides the perfect hiding spot.

Feed hamsters, gerbils, and guinea pigs once a day and rabbits twice a day. Food may include pellets and small amounts of fresh fruits and vegetables. Rabbits and guinea pigs also need fresh hay.

Hamsters and gerbils enjoy exercising on wheels, while food-dispensing toys and balls keep guinea pigs engaged. Chew toys, tunnels, balls, and cardboard boxes make good toys for rabbits.

If possible, find a safe, secure place for your bunny to exercise outside its cage. A fenced rabbit run or a room blocked off with baby gates offers space for exercise. Supervise your rabbit outdoors, even if you place it in a fenced-in area. Although your rabbit may not be able to escape, other animals could jump over the fence and harm your pet.

A visit to the veterinarian is essential if you have a new pet. Your veterinarian can offer recommendations, assess your pet for common health conditions, and provide vaccinations needed for good health. Need to make an appointment for your new pet? Contact our office to schedule your furry friend's visit.
