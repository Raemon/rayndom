Dr. Bennett’s Veterinary House Calls provides home pet euthanasia to save pets from the anxiety and fear of taking that last dreaded trip to the veterinary hospital. We believe that home pet euthanasia also allows caretakers to grieve with more privacy and provides a more optimal environment so families can help their pets make that final journey. In this blog, I would like to provide information on what to expect and what the process involves and to make some suggestions about preparing.

The most important thing to know is that proper home pet euthanasia should not impart pain or anxiety above or beyond the baseline the pet is already enduring. The process is simple:

  * An intramuscular anesthetic injection.
  * The pet falls asleep.
  * We clip a little fur over the angle to expose the vein
  * We give the euthanasia solution intravenously.



However, there is more to it than that from the perspective of Dr. Bennett. Minimal pain and anxiety-free home pet euthanasia involve:

  * A calm and friendly approach.
  * No use of invasive techniques such as placing catheters.
  * A thorough understanding between the family and the veterinarian on how the process will occur and how to prepare.



First, the caretaker and Dr. Bennett should have a phone conversation before the appointment on the demeanor of the pet, level of aggression, current illnesses, the environment where the euthanasia will take place, how many people and other pets will be present, lighting and the anticipated maneuverability around the space in which the euthanasia will take place. With this information, Dr. Bennett can choose the appropriate anesthetics and decide whether a pre-euthanasia visit is needed to leave an oral sedative before the arrival of Dr. Bennett on the final day. Knowing a little about the environment, Dr. Bennett can make lighting suggestions, such as whether other pets should be immediately present and how to ensure the least amount of anxiety and trauma for everyone involved.

Upon arrival, Dr. Bennett or his assistant will charge out before Dr. Bennett greets the pet. In the best-case scenario, Dr. Bennett will have a conversation with the people who will be present (away from the pet) to let them know how the process will take place and to give everyone a choice to be present for the sedation only, sedation, and euthanasia or not at all. Dr. Bennett will visit the pet, sit down, and build trust. Dr. Bennett will give the anesthetic so the pet falls gently asleep before the final injection. Once the pet has crossed the bridge, Dr. Bennett and his assistant will take the equipment to the truck so the family can grieve with their loved pet.
