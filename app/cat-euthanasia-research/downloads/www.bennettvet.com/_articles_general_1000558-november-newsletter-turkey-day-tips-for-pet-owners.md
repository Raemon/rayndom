**Turkey Day Tips for Pet Owners**

Does your furry friend rush to the kitchen when the first whiff of roast turkey floats through the air? Although your pet may be tempted to sample every part of your feast, some Thanksgiving foods and decorations aren't safe for pets. Prioritize your pet's health and comfort by following these Thanksgiving Day tips.

**Don't Feed Your Pet These Foods**

It may be hard to resist your pet's pleading eyes on Turkey Day, but sharing your favorite foods could spell trouble for your furry friend. Your pet's digestive system works a little differently than yours. Foods you enjoy could cause health issues ranging from diarrhea to kidney failure in pets. Avoid health problems by keeping these Thanksgiving foods away from your pet:

  * **Seasoned Turkey.** Seasonings can irritate your pet's digestive system and cause an upset stomach, vomiting, or diarrhea.
  * **Turkey Skin, Fat, and Gravy.** These foods are high in fat and could trigger pancreatitis in dogs and cats. Pancreatitis is a potentially life-threatening inflammation of the pancreas. Symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue, and lack of appetite.
  * **Onions, Chives, Leeks, Scallions, and Garlic.** Don't feed your pet any dishes that include these ingredients, including stuffing and casseroles. Eating onions, chives, scallions, leeks, or garlic can damage your pet's red blood cells and cause anemia. According to the ASPCA, cats are more likely to develop anemia, but dogs can also develop the condition depending on how much of the substance is eaten.
  * **Grapes and Raisins.** Do you love raisins in your stuffing? Eating grapes or raisins can lead to kidney failure in pets.
  * **Other Dangerous Foods.** Don't let your pet eat any food that contains chocolate, alcohol, raw eggs, yeast dough, or the sweetener xylitol (often found in sugar-free candies and desserts).



So what can you feed your pet? The American Animal Hospital Association recommends skinless, boneless, unseasoned turkey and plain carrots, pumpkin, beans, or sweet potatoes.

**Clean Up Promptly**

While you're enjoying a piece of pie and a cup of coffee, your pet may be feasting on the leftovers in the kitchen or digging through the trash. Prevent disaster by promptly refrigerating leftovers. Place pots, pans, dishes, and utensils in the dishwasher immediately, or rinse them thoroughly and put them in the sink.

Remove trash and place it outside even if the bag isn't full. Turkey bones found in the trash can splinter when chewed, damaging your pet's throat or stomach or blocking your pet's airway. String used to tie turkey legs can create a blockage in your pet's stomach or intestines.

**Find a Safe Space**

Some pets find the hustle and bustle of Thanksgiving overwhelming. If your pet isn't fond of crowds or noise, create a safe haven in another room. Choose a room in a quiet part of the house with a door that closes securely. Add your pet's food and water dishes and litter box if you have a cat. Be sure to check on your pet periodically during the day.

**Be Careful with Decorations**

Substitute battery-operate flameless candles for the real thing to prevent burns. Does your decorating plan include potpourri or a cornucopia with artificial fruit and vegetables? Taking a bite of non-food items can lead to choking or poisoning in some cases. Put decorations out of reach of pets for your furry friend's sake.

**Check the Tag**

Does your pet have a collar with an updated ID tag? It only takes a second for a pet to sneak out the door when you're welcoming guests. Lost pets that wear ID tags with their owner's name and telephone number are much more likely to be reunited with their owners.

ID tags are a must even if your dog or cat is microchipped. Although veterinary offices and animal shelters have microchip scanners, your friends and neighbors don't have access to this technology and must rely on information found on tags.

Whether it's your pet's first Thanksgiving or 10th, taking a few precautions will make the day a pleasant experience. Do you have a question about your pet's health or need to schedule a visit? Just give us a call and let us know how we can help.
