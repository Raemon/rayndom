Mobile Veterinarian In The East Bay Area California

Our Mission Statement  


**' To Deliver Quality Pet Medical Care And Pet Euthanasia Services To Pet's Within the Warmth And Security Of Their Home.'**

Dr. Bennett spent the first 13 years of his career working in local veterinary hospitals practicing medicine and surgery. Over the years of working in the hospital, Dr. Bennett noted that in many cases, pets coming to the veterinary hospital became highly stressed, sometimes to the point of having a crisis. In 2008, Dr. Bennett started working as a mobile veterinarian in Walnut Creek, Berkeley, Oakland, and other surrounding areas. Dr. Bennett quickly realized that his mobile veterinary practice allowed him to have a more personal relationship with his clients and patients. He also noticed the stress level among pets was minimal during a house call as opposed to a visit to the veterinary hospital. Dr. Bennett has practiced as a mobile veterinarian for over 16 years, and thousands of pets have benefited from his personal and caring touch.

At Dr. Bennett's Veterinary House Call Service, we are dedicated to the comfort and well-being of your pet. We strive to educate our clients on how to keep their pets healthy year-round, emphasizing preventative care, good nutrition, and exercise. Our commitment to your pet's health is our top priority.
