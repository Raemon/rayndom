**When to Switch from Puppy to Dog Food**

Energetic puppies need a diet high in calories and nutrients to fuel their rapid growth. As your puppy approaches adulthood, its dietary needs change. So when should you pick up a bag of adult dog food for your growing puppy? The answer depends on the breed and size of your dog.

**Why Switching to Adult Food Is Important**

Puppy food contains higher amounts of vitamins, minerals, protein, and fats to support muscle and bone development and overall health. Once puppies stop growing, their nutritional needs change. If you continue to feed your adult dog puppy food, your pet could become overweight or obese. Even a few extra pounds may stress your dog's joints and increase its risk for developing health problems like heart or kidney disease, cancer, arthritis, and skin disorders.

Pet obesity is a growing problem in the U.S. A 2022 survey by the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention revealed that as many as 61% of cats and 59% of dogs may be overweight or obese. Luckily, you can reduce your pet's risk of weight-related ailments simply by monitoring portion sizes and feeding your pet the appropriate food for its age and developmental stage.

Switching to adult food too soon can also cause problems. Your puppy may be deprived of crucial nutrients and fail to grow and thrive if you offer adult food before your pet is fully grown.

**Making the Switch to Adult Food**

As a general rule, puppies can transition to adult food when they're approximately 1 year old. The perfect time to offer your puppy adult food varies depending on your pet's breed, maturation rate, and size as an adult. A Great Dane may not reach its full adult size until 18 to 24 months and will need to continue to eat puppy food until it stops growing. By contrast, a Chihuahua may be fully grown at about 9 or 10 months.

Wondering when your puppy may need to move up to adult food? Keep these guidelines in mind:

  * **Small Dogs.** Small breeds that are under 25 pounds when fully grown may start adult dog food at 10 to 12 months, according to PetMD. Small breed dogs include the Shih Tzu, Pomeranian, Bichon Frise, Maltese, Dachshund, and others.
  * **Medium Dogs.** Medium-sized dogs usually begin eating adult dog food at 12 to 14 months. These breeds range from 25 to 50 pounds when fully grown. Among the dogs in this category are the Basset Hound, Poodle, Border Collie, Bulldog, Beagle, and Siberian Husky.
  * **Large Dogs.** Larger breeds take the longest to reach their full size. Depending on its expected adult size, your large or giant breed dog may remain on puppy food for as long as two years. The Tufts University Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine recommends feeding large and giant breeds puppy food specifically intended for larger breeds. Larger breeds are dogs above 50 pounds and include St. Bernard, Bernese Mountain Dog, Akita, Rottweiler, Great Dane, and Mastiff breeds.



These recommendations are only guidelines. Your dog may be ready for adult food earlier or later than average. Your veterinarian can help you decide on the ideal time to change your dog's food and recommend foods that will meet your pet's new dietary needs. During your visit to the veterinary office, you'll also receive guidance on the ideal portion size to prevent obesity.

**How to Introduce Adult Dog Food to Your Puppy**

Sudden food changes can upset your furry friend's stomach and cause diarrhea and vomiting. A gradual introduction to the new food is the key to preventing gastrointestinal problems. Start the process by mixing a little adult dog food with your puppy's usual food. During the first day or two, limit adult food to 10 to 20% of the total food in your dog's dish.

Increase the amount of adult food to 30 to 40% on the second or third day. Continue increasing the ratio of adult food until your puppy is only eating the adult dog food.

Not sure if your puppy is ready for adult food? We can help you decide the perfect time to make the switch. Contact our office to schedule an appointment or share your concerns.
