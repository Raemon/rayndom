**What to Expect When You Adopt a Senior Dog**

Are you thinking about welcoming an older dog to your home? Keeping these things in mind will help smooth the adjustment process.

**Patience Is Crucial**

Your senior dog probably experienced a big change in its life recently. Its owner may have died or the previous owner may have decided that he or she could no longer care for a pet. Although the staff at the shelter or rescue group you visited did their best to make your new pet feel comfortable, even the nicest shelter doesn't quite feel like home.

It's not surprising that your new pet may feel a little stressed after its recent experiences. Your dog may be timid or a little fearful initially or uncertain about the routines in your home.

As your dog adjusts to its new home, don't overwhelm it with too many new experiences or immediately introduce it to your friends or extended family. Plan a few low-key days where you'll focus on helping your dog adjust to your home and family. Start by showing your dog its food and water bowls, bed, and crate, and offer a tour of your home.

Are you thinking about changing your dog's name? Unless your dog has a truly objectionable name, it's best to keep its name. Name changes can be confusing and can delay the adjustment process.

**Introductions Are Important**

How your dog meets other pets is an important part of the adjustment process. If you have another dog, Petfinder suggests taking both dogs for a walk in a neutral location. Do you have several pets? Your new dog may be overwhelmed if you introduce your entire menagerie at once.

Schedule one-on-one introductions that allow plenty of time for sniffing and checking out the other pet. Keep the dogs on leashes during the introductions. Move the parts farther apart if you notice any signs of aggression. If one of the dogs behaves aggressively, you may need to keep the pets in separate parts of the house initially. Repeat the supervised meet-and-greet sessions every day until both pets feel comfortable.

**Your Dog May Be Trained**

Some older dogs are already obedience trained, which makes your job easier. Your dog may already know basic commands, like sit, stay, and come. It may also know how to walk on a leash and might have been taught not to jump on people.

Housebreaking usually isn't an issue with senior dogs. Although your new pet may be housebroken, a few accidents may happen as your dog adjusts to its new life and routine.

Take your dog outside or walk it at regular intervals. Dogs urinate three to five times per day, according to the American Kennel Club. Older dogs may need to urinate more frequently and require more potty breaks. As you spend more time with your new pet, you'll learn how often your dog needs to eliminate.

**Sudden Food Changes Aren't a Good Idea**

Your pet may experience an upset stomach and diarrhea if you offer a new food, even if the new food is of higher quality. Mix a small amount of the new food with the current food when changing your dog's food. Gradually include more of the new food every day to prevent gastrointestinal issues.

**Your Pet Could Have a Health Condition**

Older pets, like older people, are more likely to develop health problems. Arthritis, heart disease, cancer, dental problems, and cognitive issues (like dementia) are the most common health conditions in older dogs, according to DVM360.

Arthritis could make it difficult for your pet to manage stairs while missing teeth could mean that your pet may not be able to eat dry food easily. Even if your new pet is in perfect healthy now, it might develop an age-related health issue in the future. You'll need to consider this possibility and decide if you're willing to manage health issues before adopting a senior pet.

Have you recently adopted a senior dog? A thorough veterinary examination will help you identify any health issues and ensure that your pet is protected from common diseases like rabies and heartworm. Contact our office to schedule an appointment for your furry friend.
