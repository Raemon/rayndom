  * Happy Cat Month



## Happy Cat Month

  * Created in Newsletter Library 



****

**How Are You Celebrating Happy Cat Month?**

Can you imagine life without your cat? Those fluffy felines make life more interesting, provide countless hours of entertainment, and offer unconditional love. It's only fitting an entire month is dedicated to them every September. If you don't have any plans for Happy Cat Month yet, these suggestions may give you a few ideas.

**Buy Your Cat Something Nice**

Every holiday is better with gifts, including Happy Cat Month. Your cat is sure to appreciate a new toy, special treat, or even a custom-made climbing structure. If your local pet supply store doesn't have an ample selection of cat items, check out one of the many online stores dedicated to pets.

Not sure what to buy your cat? Most cats enjoy stalking and capturing prey. Indulge your pet's prey drive with a dangling toy at the end of a kitty fishing road or a battery-operated mouse that moves just like the real thing. Interactive toys keep your pet intellectually stimulated, while cat tunnels and condos offer the perfect spots to explore or take a cat nap.

**Spend More Time With Your Pet**

Society regards cats as aloof creatures, but as a feline lover, you probably know that's not exactly true. Although some cats prefer to keep their distance from people, many enjoy nothing better than curling up next to their favorite humans on the couch. Increasing the time you spend with your cat is one of the best gifts you can give your pet, whether you set aside time for a grooming session, play chase with your cat, or stream a new show with your pet at your side.

**Cat-Proof Your Home**

Cats can get into all sorts of trouble when left alone for just a few moments. Cat-proofing your home will prevent injuries and illnesses that could require an emergency trip to the veterinarian. Get down on the floor and view your home from your cat's point of view to identify potential hazards. Your cat-proofing plan may include:

  * Promptly Putting Away String, Thread, Needles, Yarn and Other Items That Could Harm Your Cat if Eaten
  * Storing Medication and Cleaning Products in Cabinets Secured with Childproof Locks
  * Keeping Trash in a Can That Closes Securely
  * Using Flameless Candles
  * Keeping Chocolate, Onions, Garlic, Scallions, Leeks, Alcohol and Caffeinated Products Secured in Cat-Proof Containers. (These foods can sicken or kill your pet.)
  * Buying House Plants That Are Safe for Pets
  * Shortening Cords on Blinds and Shades
  * Attaching Furniture to the Walls
  * Putting Essential Oils and Oil Burners Out of Reach



**Offer a Place to Scratch**

Scratching offers many benefits for your cat. According to The Humane Society of the United States, your cat scratches to:

  * Remove the Dull Outer Part of the Nails
  * Stretch Its Body
  * Make Its Territory
  * Show Emotion



Your cat will be less likely to shred your new couch if you provide a convenient place to scratch. The ideal scratching posts are sturdy, stable and long enough for your cat to extend its body fully.

**Keep an Eye on Your Pet's Weight**

Do you throw handfuls of food in your pet's dish instead of following the feeding recommendations on the package? Your pet is more likely to develop a weight problem if too much food is available. As many as 56 million American cats are overweight or obese, according to estimates from the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention. Gaining too much weight increases your cat's risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, urinary tract disease, joint issues, high blood pressure and arthritis.

If you can't feel your cat's ribs when you pet it, it may be overweight. Your veterinarian can recommend the best type of food for your pet and offer tips that will help your cat lose weight safely.

**Make a Trip to See the Veterinarian**

Annual visits to the veterinarian are essential for your cat's good health. Unfortunately, health problems aren't always obvious in the earliest stages. Regular visits help your pet's veterinarian spot signs of diseases and illnesses and offer treatments that will help protect your cat's health. Check-ups include a head-to-toe examination, a blood test and vaccinations if needed.

Ready to schedule a visit with the veterinarian? Just give us a call to make your cat's appointment.
