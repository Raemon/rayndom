**How Often Should I Groom My Dog?**

Grooming isn't just about improving your pet's appearance. Regular grooming helps your dog stay healthy, happy, and comfortable.

**The Importance of Grooming**

Regular grooming helps:

  * **Identify Health Issues.** Checking for skin irritation, fleas, ticks, wounds, sores, lumps, and bumps is part of the process when your pet is groomed.
  * **Maintain Your Pet's Coat.** Grooming gets rid of tangles and mats and removes dirt and debris from your dog's skin and hair. Brushing also keeps your pet's coat shiny and its skin soft and supple by distributing skin oils through the dog's skin and hair.
  * **Prevent Too-Long Nails.** Overgrown nails can damage floors and make walking difficult or uncomfortable for dogs. Trimming nails, whether you tackle the job yourself or take advantage of the services of a groomer, keeps nails at a comfortable length.
  * **Keep Your Home Cleaner.** Are you constantly vacuuming up dog hair? Brushing removes loose hair before it can drift through your home.
  * **Eliminate Odors.** No one wants to live in a home that smells like dog. Regular bathing and grooming help you prevent that unpleasant aroma from taking over your home.



**When Is Bathing and Brushing Necessary?**

Bathing recommendations vary from monthly to a few times a year depending on your dog's coat, breed, and activity level. According to Dogster, long-haired breeds may need baths every four to six weeks, while short-haired breeds might only need baths every two to three months. Long-hair tends to trap dirt and debris, making more frequent baths a necessity for long-haired breeds. Hairless breeds need weekly baths to prevent infections, skin irritations and clogged pores.

Bathing your pet too often can cause dry, irritated skin. Of course, if your dog enjoys playing in the mud or can't seem to resist rolling around in something stinky, it will need a bath before the recommended time.

Between baths, improve your dog's hygiene by occasionally running a damp washcloth over its coat. If your pet has allergies or skin conditions, ask your veterinarian for recommendations about bathing frequency and products.

Dogs with skin allergies may be more comfortable if they're bathed once or twice a week. Choose a gentle hypoallergenic pet shampoo or ask your veterinarian about prescription shampoos that reduce itching, remove allergens, and ease allergy symptoms.

Brush short-haired dogs at least once a week, medium-haired and double-haired breeds two or three times a week, and long-haired breeds daily.

**Other Grooming Essentials**

Oral, ear, and eye care are important aspects of good grooming. Regular brushing improves your dog's breath and reduces the risk of gum disease.

It's never too late to start brushing your dog's teeth. Ease into brushing by rubbing a moist piece of gauze across your pet's teeth. Once your dog is comfortable with the process, try brushing a few teeth at a time with a finger brush or a toothbrush made just for pets. Apply a pea-sized dab of pet toothpaste on the finger brush or brush. The American Kennel Club (AKC) recommends only using toothpaste formulated for pets, as human toothpaste contains xylitol, a sweetener that can be harmful to dogs.

Don't neglect your dog's ears during grooming sessions. Although the ears don't need to be cleaned every time you groom your pet, be sure to clean them if you notice dirt or wax buildup.

Clean dirty ears by filling the ear canals with a veterinarian-approved ear-cleaning solution. Keep your dog's head still for 30 seconds, then use a moist cotton ball to remove dirt. Follow AKC recommendations and don't insert your fingers into your pet's ears more than one knuckle deep. If you can't safely reach all the dirt, schedule an ear cleaning with a veterinarian or professional groomer.

Wondering what to do about the dried mucus that accumulates in the corners of your dog's eyes? Wet a cotton pad with warm water and gently loosen and remove the discharge. Be sure to use a fresh pad for each eye. If your pet has long hair, trim the hair around the eyes to prevent irritation.

Good grooming keeps your dog looking its best. If you need help with grooming or are concerned about a possible health issue, get in touch with our office. We'll help you schedule a convenient appointment for your furry friend.
