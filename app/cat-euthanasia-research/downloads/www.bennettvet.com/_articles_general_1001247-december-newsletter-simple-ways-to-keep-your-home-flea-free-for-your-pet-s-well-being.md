**Simple Ways to Keep Your Home Flea-Free for Your Pet**

Fleas just may be the most determined natural enemies of your pet. Once the tiny bugs invade your home, it's hard to get rid of them. Fortunately, you can eliminate the pests and keep them from returning by taking a few simple steps.

**Flea Control Basics**

Fleas enter your home on your pet's fur or your clothing. Dogs and cats are the most common hosts for fleas, although ferret, rabbits, and other pets can also be affected.

Fleas feed on your pet's blood and soon begin laying eggs in its fur. If a flea infestation is severe, you may notice a few flea bites on your skin too. Flea bites aren't just uncomfortable. They can affect your pet's health. Your pet could develop an infection after scratching its skin raw or become anemic if flea bites cause significant blood loss. Anemia occurs when the number of red blood cells in the body decreases, making it harder for the blood to carry oxygen to tissues and organs.

Once laid, flea eggs fall from your pet's fur and onto floors, pet beds, furniture, and other surfaces. It doesn't take long for fleas to take over your home. According to the University of Kentucky Department of Entomology, one adult flea can lay 40 to 50 eggs per day. After going through a larval and pupae (cocoon) stage, adult fleas emerge just a few weeks after eggs are laid.

Getting rid of fleas isn't a simple process. Flea prevention involves frequent cleaning and treatment to remove fleas at all stages of the life cycle.

**Vacuum, Sweep, and Mop Often**

Vacuuming removes flea eggs, larvae, and adult fleas from your home. Vacuum upholstery, carpets, and pet bedding at least once a week. More frequent vacuuming is helpful if you see fleas. After you vacuum, put the bag in an outside trash can. If you have a bag-free vacuum, empty the canister into a trash bag outside before placing it in the trash can.

Sweep and mop uncarpeted floors using cleaning products safe for your floor type. Pay particular attention to corners and baseboards when sweeping.

**Wash Soft Items**

Choose washable beds for your pet, and launder them regularly. In fact, wash anything your pet comes in contact with, including favorite blankets and stuffed toys. Does your pet like to sleep with you or other family members? Although you may wash your sheets and pillowcases often, what about throw pillows, mattress pads, bedspreads, and comforters? Washing these items periodically can help you keep your home flea-free.

**Make Yard Care a Priority**

Is your yard the perfect environment for fleas? Fleas enjoy shady, moist places and dislike sunny spots. Evict them by keeping your grass short to reduce shade. Pull weeds and remove lawn clippings soon after mowing. Fleas can enter your yard on wild animals, like raccoons and opossums. Solve the problem by repairing holes in fences promptly. Remove debris and thick brush that make your home attractive to animals.

Use a flea and tick spray to control fleas in your yard. Spraying once a month ensures that fleas are killed throughout the life cycle. Flea and tick spray could make your pet sick if it comes in contact with the wet spray. Don't let your pet outside until the grass is dry.

If you prefer a more natural lawn care solution, PetMD recommends sprinkling diatomaceous earth on your yard or buying flea and tick lawn care products that contain plant-based ingredients.

**Talk to Your Veterinarian About Year-Round Flea Protection**

Year-round flea and tick protection offers a simple way to protect your pet from fleas. The monthly products kill adult fleas, eggs, and larvae. Some products are applied directly to your pet's skin, while others are available in chewable form. Although these medications offer a safe way to control fleas and ticks, some may not be the best choice for young or old pets or those with chronic health conditions. Your veterinarian can recommend the best flea control product for your pet.
