**Tips on Grooming Your New Puppy**

It's never too early to think about a grooming routine for your new puppy. Grooming keeps your pet feeling and looking its best and can reduce the risk of skin and ear infections. Not sure where to start? These tips will help you keep your puppy clean and comfortable.

**Set the Stage Early**

You may be wondering how you're ever going to manage to groom your wriggly puppy. Although standing still may not be one of your furry friend's strengths, practice sessions can help your puppy learn to tolerate the process. Spend a few minutes each day gently touching your puppy's ears, face, feet, and body. Once you begin the grooming process, your pet will already be used to being handled.

**Consider Your Pet's Energy Level in Mind When Grooming**

It's easier to groom a sleepy puppy than a whirling bundle of energy. Schedule grooming sessions just before naps or bedtime or after playtime when your puppy is tired.

**Keep Sessions Short**

You may not be able to accomplish everything on your grooming list in one session, and that's perfectly fine. Your puppy may only be able to sit still long enough for you to trim three nails or brush a few teeth initially. As your puppy gets older and adjusts to the grooming routine, you can gradually increase the length of grooming sessions.

**Arrange Your Supplies in Advance**

You may test the limits of your pet's patience if you have to search the house for a brush or don't have bathing supplies handy. Make sure you have all the supplies you need before you scoop up your puppy for a bath or nail trim.

**Make a Schedule**

Following a schedule can help you ensure that you cover grooming basics. A sample schedule may look like this:

  * **Brush Your Puppy (Daily).** Brushing removes dirt, debris, shed skin cells, and loose hair and prevents tangled or matted hair. As you brush your pet, you'll spread oils that moisturize your puppy's coat. Brushing also offers the perfect opportunity to examine your puppy for fleas, ticks, lumps, bumps, or sores.
  * **Clean Your Puppy's Teeth (Daily).** Daily tooth cleaning helps your pet avoid painful gum disease and tooth loss. You can start toothbrushing as early as six weeks. Start by rubbing the teeth with a small piece of moist gauze to help your puppy adjust to the sensation, then switch to a finger or traditional brush. Add a pea-sized drop of paste to the brush. Toothpaste specifically made for dogs is best, as toothpaste manufactured for human use can upset your pet's stomach, according to the American Humane Association.
  * **Clean Your Pet's Ears. (Weekly).** Clean your puppy's ears inside and out with ear cleaning solution. Squirt the solution in your dog's ear canal, rub the base of the ear gently, then wipe away debris with a cotton ball. Regular cleaning can help your pet avoid infections caused by yeast or bacteria.
  * **Bathing. (Monthly or as recommended by your pet's veterinarian).** Bathe your pet every month or two, as too frequent bathing can dry your puppy's skin. Follow the American Kennel Club's advice and start baths when your puppy is about two months old. Use a moist, warm washcloth initially, then transition to sink or tub bathing in a month or two. Don't share your shampoo with your puppy. Choose a product specially formulated for your dog's sensitive skin.
  * **Clip Nails (Every two to three weeks).** If you hear your puppy's nails clicking against the floor, it's time for a trim. You only need to remove the end of the nail when giving your pet a pedicure. Stay away from the quick, the part of the nail that contains nerves and blood vessels. The quick looks pink in light-colored dogs but can be hard to see in black dogs. Cutting into the quick can cause pain and bleeding and make your puppy fear nail trims. If you don't feel confident trimming your puppy's nails, make an appointment with a groomer.
  * **Visit the Groomer (As needed).** Some people enjoy grooming their pets at home, while others prefer to let professional groomers take over bathing, nail trims, and haircuts. PetMD recommends reading online reviews and visiting grooming facilities before choosing a groomer for your puppy.
