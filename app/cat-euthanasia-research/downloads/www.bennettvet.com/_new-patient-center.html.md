Mobile Veterinarian In The East Bay Area California

_** **_

**Dr. Bennett's Veterinary House Calls is a mobile veterinary service delivering quality medicine with your pets comfort in mind. Please read ahead to answer any questions you may have before deciding on a mobile veterinarian.**

_**Why choose a mobile veterinarian**?_

**1)****Pet anxiety** : For most pets a visit to the veterinary hospital can be a very stressful event. Assuming the pets anxiety is due to the smells, site and sounds of other traumatized and fearful pets along with the memories of being pocked and prodded on previous visits, a pets fear of veterinary hospitals is a rational and real one. Choosing a mobile veterinarian will likely prevent any anxiety associated with pet medical care.

**2)** **Convenience** : Using a mobile veterinarian can minimize the time and effort it takes to obtain medical care for your pet. Many people have busy schedules and can not afford the time it takes to bring the pets to the veterinary hospital. Dr. Bennett's house calls alleviates most of this burden. Appointments are made for a specific time thus allowing you to continue your routine while waiting for the Dr. Bennett to arrive. Dr. Bennett usually arrives on time but because of Bay Area traffic and the time it take to complete a house call, please reserve 1/2 hour before and 2 hours after appointment time.

**3)** **Individualized care with no distractions** : Attention to each pet is better achieved in the calmness of your pets home with out the chaotic detraction of a busy veterinary hospital. Furthermore, as part of the consultation, Dr. Bennett can assess your pets environment and better understand it's daily habits and routines.
