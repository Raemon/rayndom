**Tips For A Successful Veterinary House Call**

  


1) When calling for a veterinary house call inform the doctor/staff of any aggressive, fractious, or fearful pets. 

2) Kitties should be sequestered to a bathroom before we arrive to prevent the kitty from crawling behind or under furniture. If we look for the kitty, it will feel pursued and naturally become anxious. 

3) Please have distractions to a minimum including, television/music, other pets, and children. 

4) Please make sure the area where we will be working can withstand spills and excrement if there is an accident.   


5) Please provide a well-lit place for Dr. Bennett to examine your pet and complete any procedures. Cleared-off countertops or a table is beneficial for cats and small dogs. For large dogs, a cleared spot on the floor will suffice. For outside dogs, please provide a covered area if it is raining. 

6) Please try to have your Wi-Fi password available in case the cell phone connection is poor. We use special software to process your pets health record, charges and document transfers (vaccine certificates, drug safety sheets, receipt etc.).
