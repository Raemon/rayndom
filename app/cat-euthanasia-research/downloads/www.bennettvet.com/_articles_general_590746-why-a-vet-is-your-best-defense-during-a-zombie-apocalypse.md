  * Why A Vet Is Your Best Defense During A Zombie Apocalypse



## Why A Vet Is Your Best Defense During A Zombie Apocalypse

  * Created in Newsletter Library 



**How a Veterinarian Can Help You Survive a Zombie Apocalypse**

It's impossible to fight zombies alone. In fact, your survival during a zombie apocalypse may depend on the people hiding in the abandoned house with you. A veterinarian may not seem like an obvious choice for your zombie survival dream team, but vets possess many of the skills you'll need when the creatures attack.

**Have an Injury? You'll Need a Medical Professional on Your Team**

It's a given that you or someone in your group will break a leg while trying to escape from the zombie horde. Without medical attention, your leg can become infected or heal badly, putting your survival at risk.

If your injury worsens, the rest of the group may even decide to leave you behind. Fortunately, your veterinarian friend won't let that happen. Veterinarians have the medical knowledge and skills to treat injuries and illnesses that could make you an easy target for bloodthirsty zombies.

**Veterinarians Know How to Calm Savage Beasts**

Despite their undead status, zombies are surprisingly good at sneaky, coordinated attacks. Venture outside alone, and you'll quickly be surrounded by a group of snarling, decomposing creatures intent on making you their next snack.

Vets receive training that helps them calm and control scared or aggressive animals. Thanks to their experiences working with many types of animals, veterinarians aren't going to be intimidated by a few scary zombies. In fact, your veterinarian friend may know a few tricks that will keep the creatures from attacking.

**Someone Has to Care for the Animals**

A few years ago, the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) explored the ways veterinarians can be helpful during a zombie apocalypse. AVMA zombie experts identified animal care as an essential aspect of life after an apocalypse. With no one to manage the electrical grid, they noted that people will increasingly rely on animals for protection and transportation.

Veterinarians can keep the animals healthy, start breeding programs, and manage livestock. They'll also supervise food production, ensure food handling protocols are followed and develop techniques and protocols to keep the food supply safe.

**Veterinarians Are Used to Hard Work**

There's always one person in zombie movies who hides or runs away when things get tough. A veterinarian isn't going to be that person. Veterinarians regularly lift heavy animals, calm upset pet owners, and make life and death decisions. Surgery, part of every veterinarian's duties, can take hours and requires stamina, ingenuity, and tenacity. All of these qualities are very useful when zombies are pounding on the walls.

**The Apocalypse Will Never End If No One Finds a Cure**

The zombie apocalypse in the movie "I Am Legend" only ended because Dr. Robert Neville, played by Will Smith, finally found a cure for the virus. If you're fighting zombies, you'll want someone like Dr. Neville on your side. Your veterinarian has the knowledge needed to develop and test cures and treatments for the virus. Without a cure or treatment, the zombie population will only continue to grow, putting many lives at risk.

Whether you need protection from zombies or medical care for your pet, veterinarians offer highly specialized skills that make the world a more pleasant place. If it's time for your pet's checkup, or you have questions about a health issue, give us a call.
