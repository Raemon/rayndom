**Signs of Heatstroke in Pets**

Summer heatwaves are just as uncomfortable for your pets as they are for you. In fact, pets can develop heatstroke just like people. Recognizing the signs of this potentially deadly condition will help you protect the health of your furry friends.

**How to Tell If Your Pets Are Suffering from Heatstroke**

Any pet, including dogs, cats, and small animals, can suffer heatstroke on hot or humid days. The condition occurs when your pet's body temperature becomes dangerously high. Young, old, obese, or sick animals may feel the effects of the heat more acutely, as can boxers, pugs, bulldogs, and other dogs with short noses.

You may see these signs if your pet is experiencing heatstroke:

  * **Panting.** Pets cool down by panting. Wheezing or panting heavily is a common sign of distress.
  * **Diarrhea and Vomiting.** Pets may vomit or have diarrhea as their body temperatures rise suddenly.
  * **Drooling.** As heatstroke worsens, your pet may also drool more than usual, and you may notice that its tongue or gums are red.
  * **Weakness and Confusion.** Weakness, confusion, lethargy, and coordination problems can accompany heatstroke.
  * **Seizures or Collapse.** If your pet doesn't receive emergency medical care, it may develop seizures, collapse, or even die.



**What to Do If Your Pet Shows Signs of Heatstroke**

If you think your pet is affected by heatstroke, take the following steps:

  * **Bring Your Pet Indoors.** Don't wait for symptoms to worsen. Bring your pet indoors at the first sign of heatstroke. An air-conditioned space is best. If your home isn't air-conditioned, use fans to circulate air.
  * **Provide Cool Water.** Give your pet cool water to drink. Make sure the water is cool, not cold.
  * **Cool Off Your Pet.** Soak a towel in lukewarm water, wring out the towel, and place it over your pet. Put another towel under your pet. Wet a washcloth with lukewarm water and gently rub your pet's paws and ears. Although it might seem like a good idea to use the coldest water possible, doing so could cause a dangerous change in blood pressure, according to the American Animal Hospital Association.
  * **Take Your Pet's Temperature.** Dogs and cats suffer heatstroke when their temperatures rise above 104F. Check your pet's temperature every 60 seconds to determine if your cooling efforts are dropping your pet's temperature.
  * **Take Your Pet to the Veterinarian.** Your pet's veterinarian can provide emergency care if your pet's temperature doesn't drop or its condition doesn't improve in 10 - 15 minutes. Once at the veterinary office or hospital, your pet will receive intravenous fluids and other treatments, such as oxygen or medications to stabilize blood pressure. Your veterinarian may also draw blood, which will be used to determine if the liver or kidney damage occurred as a result of the heatstroke.



**How to Prevent Heatstroke**

You can reduce your pet's risk for heatstroke by:

  * **Limiting Outdoor Time on Hot Days.** According to research from Nottingham Trent University, 75% of heatstroke cases in dogs occurred while exercising outdoors. University researchers also noted that cats were more likely to develop heatstroke after being trapped in sheds, greenhouses, or other enclosures. The less time your pet spends outdoors when the mercury soars, the better. Pay attention to humidity, too. High humidity coupled with average or high summer temperatures, can increase your pet's chances for developing heatstroke. Limit outdoor playtime to brief periods in the morning and evening when it's cooler. Postpone long walks or runs for another day.
  * **Providing Shade.** Make sure your pet has access to a shady spot during the brief periods it spends outdoors on hot, humid days. A dog house isn't a good solution, as the temperature inside dog houses can become dangerously hot during the summer. Keep cages for guinea pigs, hamsters, and gerbils out of direct sunlight.
  * **Making Cool Water a Priority.** Offer a constant supply of clean, cool water. Check the water throughout the day, replacing it as needed.
  * **Don't Leave Your Pet in the Car.** The temperature inside a car can become dangerously hot in minutes, even if you crack the window. Leave your pets at home, or take them with you on your errands.
