**Does Your Cat Do These Strange Things?**

Wondering why your cat suddenly zooms through your house or kneads your favorite blanket? There's actually a good reason for your cat's strange behavior. If you're puzzled by your furry friend's antics, take a look at our list of weird feline habits and the reasons behind them.

**High-Speed Sprints**

You're sitting on the couch watching TV when your cat runs past you at warp speed. Commonly called the "zoomies," these mad dashes perplex humans but make perfect sense to your cat. Hill's Pet Nutrition explains that your cat may be:

  * Chasing a Pretend Mouse
  * Burning Off Excess Energy After a Long Nap
  * Ending a Visit to the Litterbox



**Touching Your Face When You're Asleep**

Your cat can't get enough of you, even when you're sleeping. Touching its paws to your face transfers its scent and sends a "this human is mine" message to other animals. It's the same reason your cat likes to rub its face against your legs.

Does your cat gently bat you in the face in the morning? Rolling over or covering your face with the blanket won't stop your furry friend. When your cat decides it's time for you to wake up, you will wake up. Of course, you might be persistent too if you couldn't fill your food dish yourself.

**Kneading Clothing and Blankets**

As a kitten, your cat moved its paws back and forth on its mother's chest to stimulate milk production when nursing. Years after a cat stops nursing, it still may find this behavior soothing. In fact, it may regularly knead a blanket or even your clothing. Some cats also suck on the fabric when kneading.

The American Animal Hospital Association notes that cats may also knead to create a comfortable place to rest, calm themselves, show pleasure or mark their territory.

**Bringing You Gifts**

Dropping a dead mouse or cricket at your feet is the ultimate compliment as far as your cat is concerned. Of course, you may not feel the same way. Your pet brings you these items because it considers you an important part of its family and wants you to enjoy a tasty meal of raw mouse too.

If your cat doesn't kill prey, it may bring you a favorite toy instead. Lavish praise, whether you love your gift or not, will make your pet feel its contribution was appreciated.

**Chirping**

Does your cat make a strange chirping sound when watching a bird, squirrel or another animal through the window? Certified Cat Behavior Consultant Marilyn Krieger told Catster that cats may chirp if they're excited at the thought of catching prey, experience an increase in adrenaline at the sight of prey animals, or feel frustrated that there's a window between them and prey.

**Knocking Things Over**

Pushing over pens, plants, lamps and other objects may seem to be your cat's favorite hobby. Cats enjoy knocking over objects for many reasons. They may be bored or might want to retrieve something that's inside the object. Purina reports that cat may want to find out if the object could be potential prey.

Cats may also knock things over if they're bored or want to get your attention. Scheduling regular playtime and offering a selection of interesting toys could help curb this behavior.

Do you have questions about your cat's behavior? Get in touch with us and share your concerns.
