## November Newsletter: The Importance of Bloodwork for Your Pet’s Health

**The Importance of Bloodwork for Your Pet's Health**

Your pet's blood provides valuable information about your furry friend's health. Routine bloodwork can reveal signs of trouble long before symptoms appear and help you protect your pet's health.

**Why Bloodwork Is Important**

Blood tests help your veterinarian determine if your senior cat has the early signs of kidney disease or your dog has diabetes or an infection. The earlier these and other diseases and illnesses are treated, the less likely your pet will experience serious complications.

Blood tests also ensure that your pet is healthy enough to tolerate anesthesia used for surgical procedures and tooth cleaning. Does your pet take medication for a chronic condition? Regular bloodwork helps your veterinarian determine if the medication is working as expected and also provides important information regarding the progression of the disease.

Does your pet receive yearly blood tests? The tests provide a reference point regarding normal levels for your furry friend. Once a baseline is established, it's easier to spot subtle changes that may mean your pet is developing a health issue.

Bloodwork is particularly important for older pets, as the risk for diabetes, kidney disease, and cancer increases with age. Almost half of dogs and a third of cats over age 10 die from cancer, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. Regular bloodwork detects changes triggered by cancer, ensuring that your pet receives prompt treatment.

**What Information Does Bloodwork Provide?**

Your veterinarian may order a complete blood count (CBC) and blood chemistry panel as part of your pet's yearly exam. The CBC measures the amount of red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, hemoglobin, and hematocrit in your pet's blood. This test provides important information about your pet's immune system and ability to produce blood cells and platelets that transport oxygen, remove carbon dioxide, and stop bleeding.

Your veterinarian looks for levels that are higher or lower than normal. For example, high levels of white blood cells could mean your pet has an infection or disease, while low levels of red blood cells may be a sign of anemia.

The blood chemistry panel evaluates the chemicals, minerals, enzymes, proteins, glucose (sugar), and hormones in your pet's blood. It helps your veterinarian diagnose diseases and conditions like kidney disease, diabetes, or liver disease. Depending on your pet's symptoms, your veterinarian may also recommend blood tests to check your pet's thyroid function or heartworm status, or determine if allergies are the reason why your pet can't stop scratching.

Some breeds are prone to developing certain diseases. Bloodwork helps your veterinarian evaluate your pet's risk and make monitoring or treatment recommendations based on the results.

**Preparing for Bloodwork**

Just like people, some pets need to fast before bloodwork. Ask your veterinarian when your pet must stop eating if fasting is required. Although your pet can't eat food or treats, drinking water is fine before bloodwork. In fact, your pet should be encouraged to drink water to prevent dehydration. PetMD notes that even mild dehydration can affect blood test results. Exertion may also affect bloodwork results. Activities that involve running and jumping should be avoided before your pet's appointment.

Does your pet take daily medication? Some medications may need to be stopped before bloodwork. Your veterinarian will let you know if your pet should take its medication as usual before a blood test.

Bloodwork offers a simple way to safeguard your pet's health. Need to schedule bloodwork or an exam? Contact our office to make your pet's appointment.
