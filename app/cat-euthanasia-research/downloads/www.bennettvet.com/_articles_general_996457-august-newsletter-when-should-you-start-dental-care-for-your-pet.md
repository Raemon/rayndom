**When Should You Start Dental Care for Your Pet?**

Dental care is just as important for pets as it is for people. Gum disease, broken teeth and other dental issues can be painful and affect your pet's health and comfort. Providing regular dental care can help your furry friend avoid common dental problems.

**Dental Care Timeline Recommendations**

Tooth brushing can start as early as 6 weeks for puppies and kittens. Brushing or cleaning your pet's teeth removes plaque and tartar. Buildup of these substances can cause periodontal, or gum disease. Untreated gum disease may lead to infections and tooth loss.

By age 3, 80% of dogs and cats show signs of early gum disease, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. If the gums become infected, bacteria can spread to your pet's heart, kidneys, and other organs, which can sometimes be fatal.

Although home oral care is important, your pet also needs regular dental exams and professional teeth cleanings performed by a veterinarian. Regular exams and dental cleanings can prevent costly extractions or treatments in the future and help your pet avoid dental pain. The Pet Food Institute suggests starting professional cleanings when your pet is one to two years old. Yearly exams and cleanings are recommended throughout your pet's life.

Has your older pet never received dental care? It's never too late to start tooth brushing at home and dental exams and cleanings in the veterinary office.

**How to Care for Your Pet's Teeth at Home**

Worried that your pet won't cooperate with brushing? Although your pet may be reluctant or uncertain about teeth cleaning at first, you can make brushing a routine part of the day with patience and perseverance. These tips will help you create an oral care routine for your dog or cat:

  * **Start Small.** Gently rub a few teeth with a pet dental wipe or a moistened piece of gauze. The gauze or wipe removes plaque and helps your pet adjust to the sensation of something in its mouth. As the days go by, gradually increase the number of teeth cleaned with the gauze or wipe.
  * **Introduce the Toothbrush.** Switch to a pet toothbrush when your pet is comfortable with oral care. Start with a few teeth at first. Brush the fronts, backs, and chewing surfaces of teeth. If your pet isn't willing to sit still for the minute or two it takes to brush its teeth, break up toothbrushing into several shorter sessions. Daily toothbrushing is ideal, but your pet will still benefit from brushing if you can only brush its teeth every other day.
  * **Don't Use Too Much Toothpaste.** More isn't better when it comes to toothpaste. A pea-sized drop of toothpaste is the perfect amount to clean your pet's teeth. Never brush your furry friend's teeth with human toothpaste. Although it may be convenient to share your toothpaste, human toothpaste contains ingredients that can be toxic to pets.



Dental chews and toys and dental drops added to your pet's water reduce plaque in your pet's mouth and improve breath odor. Special dental diets designed to decrease plaque formation may be recommended for some pets.

**How Your Veterinarian Cares for Your Pet's Teeth**

During dental exams, your veterinarian looks for signs of trouble, including red or puffy gums, bleeding gums, receding gums, yellow or brown tartar buildup, lumps, and loose, missing, or broken teeth. Your pet's doctor will also ask you if you've noticed any changes in your pet that could indicate a dental problem. Does your pet struggle to eat or only chew on one side of its mouth? Have you noticed nasal discharge, bad breath, or a disinterest in chew toys? These are all signs that something may be wrong with your pet's teeth.

Some pets are more likely to develop dental problems than others, particularly those with crowded or overlapping teeth. Virginia Tech Veterinary Teaching Hospital notes that crowded teeth occur more often in breeds with flat faces, like pugs and Persian cats. Crowded or overlapping teeth trap plaque, making it harder to remove the sticky substance by brushing alone.

Dental visits also include professional tooth cleanings. Cleanings remove plaque, tartar, and bacteria on the teeth and gums. Worried that your pet won't sit still for a cleaning? Dental cleanings are performed under anesthesia for your pet's comfort.

Is it time for your pet's dental exam and cleaning? Contact our office to schedule your furry friend's appointment.
