**5 Warning Signs Your Pet Needs Urgent Care**

"Be prepared" is an excellent motto, whether you're a Boy Scout or a pet owner. The more you know about pet emergencies, the quicker you can respond if your pet needs urgent care. Below are five warning signs that shouldn't be ignored:

**Difficulty Breathing**

Trouble breathing is a sure sign your pet needs immediate emergency care. Difficulty breathing includes:

  * Struggling or Gasping for Air
  * Wheezing
  * Rapid Breathing
  * Choking



Pets in distress may pant, breathe noisily, or extend their necks. You may notice that your furry friend's side pulls in dramatically when breathing. Breathing problems can occur due to foreign objects stuck in the airway, infections, allergic reactions, or heart or lung problems.

**Injuries and Bleeding**

Wondering if you can treat a bleeding wound at home? Although small cuts or scratches can be cleaned and bandaged at home, severe bleeding is an emergency. If a wound is deep, large, or won't stop bleeding, head for the veterinary office. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, wounds that don't stop bleeding after five minutes require emergency care.

Your pet also needs urgent treatment if it has broken a limb. Broken limbs may look deformed, although that's not always the case. Swelling, limping and bruising can also be signs of a fracture.

If your pet was hit by a car or fell a long distance, it may have internal bleeding, even if it looks fine. Pets that have experienced these events should visit a veterinarian as soon as possible.

Signs of internal bleeding include:

  * Rapid Breathing
  * Fast Heart Rate
  * Weakness
  * Lethargy
  * Bloody Stool or Vomit
  * Cool Skin, Particularly Around the Ears, Legs and Tail
  * Pale or Blue Gums and Tongue
  * Enlarged Abdomen



**Seizures or Loss of Consciousness**

Loss of consciousness is never normal and requires immediate veterinary care to determine the reason. Seizures may also be a sign of a serious medical issue.

Watching your pet have a seizure is a scary experience. Unfortunately, there's not much you can do during a seizure, other than keep dangerous or breakable objects away from your pet. Your cat, dog or small animal won't swallow its tongue. In fact, you should keep your hands away from your pet's mouth to avoid an accidental bite.

Seizure signs include:

  * Shaking, Jerking, or Twitching
  * Biting Motions
  * Trouble Walking
  * Collapse or Loss of Consciousness
  * Involuntary Urination or Defecation
  * Drooling
  * Confusion or Odd Behaviors
  * Loss of Consciousness



**Problems with Pee, Poop, and Vomit**

Does your pet strain to pee or poop without success? Inability to urinate or defecate can be a sign of a serious health condition. Male cats are particularly prone to developing urinary tract blockages. These blockages can become life-threatening if your pet doesn't receive prompt emergency care. According to the American College of Veterinary Surgeons, urinary tract blockages in cats occur most often between the ages of 1 and 10.

Any animal, male or female, can develop a blockage or tumor that interferes with urination and defecation. Unfortunately, there's nothing you can do at home to treat blockages. Without veterinary care, your pet could become very ill and may even die.

Frequent diarrhea and vomiting are also cause for concern. If vomiting and diarrhea happen several times a day, continue for more than one day, or you notice bloody diarrhea or vomit, contact your veterinarian.

**Collapse or Extreme Weakness**

Sudden collapse or weakness may be signs of a serious health issue. Other warning signs include:

  * Balance or Coordination Problems
  * Falling Over
  * Weak Back Legs
  * Confusion or Disorientation
  * Failing to Respond to the Pet's Name



Don't wait to call the veterinarian if your pet exhibits any of these signs. Bring your pet to our office immediately, or take it to an emergency veterinary clinic if the office is closed. Not sure if it's an emergency? Give us a call and we'll let you know if your pet needs to be seen by a veterinarian.
