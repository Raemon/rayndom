## September Newsletter: At What Age Should You Start Brushing Your Cat's Teeth?

  * Created in Newsletter Library 



****

**When Should You Start Brushing Your Cat's Teeth?**

Are you ready to start brushing your cat's teeth, but aren't sure if it's the best time? Cleaning your cat's teeth can start earlier than you may think.

**Is It the Right Time to Brush Your Cat's Teeth?**

Toothbrushing can start as soon as your kitten is weaned, according to PetMD. Weaning is a gradual process that usually takes place between 4 and 10 weeks of age. Your kitten will probably have its full set of 26 baby teeth by the time it's weaned.

Older cats benefit from toothbrushing too. It's never too late to start brushing your pet's teeth, although the process may be easier if it's begun when your furry friend is young.

**Why Is Toothbrushing Important?**

Cavities aren't common in cats, but felines can develop periodontal (gum) disease. Most pets have some degree of periodontal disease by the time they're 3, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.

This disease happens when plaque on the teeth hardens into grayish-brown tartar. Tartar increases your pet's risk for periodontal disease by inflaming and irritating the gums. Periodontal disease may be mild initially, but can progress to a painful bacterial infection if your cat doesn't visit the veterinary office for a dental cleaning.

If the disease becomes severe, chewing becomes painful, and your pet may lose teeth. Tooth loss isn't the only concern. Bacteria can spread from the gums to the heart and organs, putting your favorite feline's health in jeopardy.

Toothbrushing removes plaque before it can turn into tartar. Although plaque can be removed at home, tartar is so hard that it must be scraped off during a professional cleaning.

**Brushing Your Cat's Teeth**

No matter your cat's age, it's best to use a gradual process to introduce toothbrushing. Start by following these steps:

  * **Offer a Toothpaste Sample.** Put a small drop of toothpaste on your finger or a toothbrush and let your cat smell and taste it. Use toothpaste intended for pet consumption, as minty human toothpaste could upset your cat's stomach.
  * **Practice Holding Your Pet.** International Cat Care recommends holding your cat on your lap facing away from you when brushing its teeth. Try this position a few times before you start toothbrushing. Offer plenty of praise while you hold your cat in the position.
  * **Give Brushing a Trial Run.** Put a rice-sized drop of toothpaste on a cotton swab when your pet has tasted the toothpaste and is used to being held. Gently rub the outside surface of the teeth with the swab. Help your cat establish a positive association with dental care by offering a treat when you're finished.
  * **Introduce the Toothbrush.** Swap the cotton swab for a pet toothbrush after your cat becomes comfortable with the cotton swab. It doesn't matter which tooth you start with when brushing. Although the back teeth collect the most plaque and tartar, it may be easier to brush the front teeth first. Choose a toothbrush with a small head that fits comfortably in your cat's mouth. Pet supply stores sell toothbrushes or you could use a brush intended for babies.



Patience is important when introducing toothbrushing. At first, you may only be able to brush one or two teeth before your cat objects. As your cat becomes accustomed to toothbrushing, it may be able to tolerate longer sessions.

**What If My Cat Doesn't Cooperate?**

Some cats find toothbrushing more difficult than others and refuse to cooperate. Although brushing teeth is the best way to remove plaque, these strategies may reduce plaque formation.

  * **Feed Your Pet Dry Food.** The mechanical action of the food rubbing against the teeth will remove some plaque.
  * **Talk to Your Veterinarian About a Dental Diet.** If your cat is a reluctant brusher, your veterinarian may prescribe a special food that helps keep plaque and tartar under control.
  * **Offer Dental Treats.** Give your cat treats specially formulated to reduce plaque on teeth.



Regular toothbrushing, in addition to dental cleanings at the veterinary office, help your cat avoid painful periodontal disease. Contact us if you'd like to schedule a cleaning or you have questions about your pet's oral health.
