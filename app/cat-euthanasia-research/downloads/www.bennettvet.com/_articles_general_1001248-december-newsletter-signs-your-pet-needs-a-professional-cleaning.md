## December Newsletter: Signs Your Pet Needs a Professional Cleaning

**Signs Your Pet Needs Professional Teeth Cleaning**

Your pet can't alert you when its gums feel sore or chewing crunchy treats hurts. Luckily, you can tell when it's time for professional cleaning by checking your pet's mouth and monitoring behavioral changes. Cleanings, recommended every year for most dogs and cats, improve breath odors and reduce your furry friend's risk of gum infections and tooth loss. These 10 signs may mean your pet needs a professional dental cleaning.

**Tartar Buildup**

Tartar causes unattractive yellow and brown stains on your pet's teeth. Sticky, colorless plaque turns into hard, unsightly tartar if your pet's teeth aren't brushed regularly. Although it's easy to spot tartar at the base of your pet's teeth, you can't see plaque and tartar below the gum line. The longer plaque and tartar remain on the teeth, the greater the risk of periodontal (gum) disease. This disease occurs when bacteria in plaque and tartar trigger infections and inflammation in the gums.

According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, most pets will probably show early signs of periodontal disease by the time they're three years old. Without treatment, painful periodontal disease can cause infections that affect gums and bones and loosen teeth.

**Chronic Bad Breath**

Can't stand your pet's breath lately? Every pet's breath smells bad occasionally, particularly after eating smelly food. However, chronic bad breath can be a sign of a dental problem, such as a bacterial infection.

Some breeds have an increased risk for tooth and gum issues and may need more frequent professional cleanings. Older dogs, small dogs, Spaniard breeds, Toy Poodles, Greyhounds, and flat-faced dogs are more likely to develop dental disease, according to a research study conducted by the Royal Veterinary College's VetCompass Programme.

**Gum Changes**

Your pet's gums may bleed or look puffy and red if it's time for a cleaning. You may first notice there's something wrong with your pet's gums when you see blood on toys or food dishes. These gum symptoms happen when plaque and tartar irritate gum tissue.

**Eating Difficulties**

Imagine trying to eat a sandwich, chew a juicy piece of steak, or snack on a handful of nuts with sore gums or loose teeth. After a while, you might decide it's no longer worth the effort to eat these foods. Your pet may feel the same way. If your furry friend is no longer interested in certain foods, such as hard food or treats, a dental issue could be to blame.

Other signs that your pet may have a dental issue that could be improved with professional cleaning include dropping food when eating and weight loss.

**Pawing at the Mouth**

Your pet may paw at its mouth or face if dental issues cause pain. Pets that previously enjoyed head rubs may shy away when touched on the head or mouth.

**Drooling**

Some pets, like Great Danes and Mastiffs, are natural droolers, while others only drool occasionally. Although drooling isn't necessarily a sign your pet needs a dental cleaning, an increase in drooling should always be investigated.

**Facial Swelling**

Does your pet's face look swollen or puffy? Facial swelling could be caused by inflamed or infected gum tissue. A thorough professional cleaning removes plaque, tartar, and bacteria, which could help reduce swelling. Antibiotics may also be prescribed to treat infections.

**Behavioral Changes**

Is your pet unusually irritated or grumpy? Struggling with dental pain could turn your normally happy pet into a grouch. If you've noticed behavioral changes, it's a good idea to schedule an appointment with your veterinarian. A change in behavior can be a sign of health issues ranging from dental problems to skin allergies to thyroid issues.

**No Time to Play**

Dental pain may make playtime unpleasant for your dog or cat. Pets may be less interested in play that involves mouthing toys, like retrieving a tennis ball or catching a Frisbee.

**Loose or Missing Teeth**

A loose or missing tooth could mean your pet has a periodontal infection. Professional cleanings are the first step in treating infections and improving your pet's dental health.
