## September Newsletter: How Often Should You Schedule a Dental Cleaning for Your Pet?

**How Often Should You Schedule a Dental Cleaning for Your Pet?**

Dental cleanings are essential for good oral health in both pets and people. Regular cleanings eliminate plaque and tartar on teeth, reducing your pet's risk for periodontal (gum) disease.

**Is It the Right Time for Your Pet's Dental Cleaning?**

Annual dental cleanings performed by a veterinarian are recommended for all dogs and cats. Without regular cleanings, plaque and tartar build up on the teeth. Plaque, a clear, sticky, bacterial film hardens into tartar if it's not removed within a week. Tartar is visible as a hard brown or yellowish deposit on your pet's teeth.

Tartar irritates and inflames the gums and can cause gum disease. As periodontal disease worsens, the gums may become infected. Bacterial infections damage the gums, ligaments and bones holding the teeth in place and can lead to tooth loss, pain and dental abscesses. Bacteria in infected gums can spread through your pet's blood to the heart, liver, brain, or kidneys.

Gum disease is a common problem in pets. The American Veterinary Medical Association notes that dogs and cats may show signs of gum disease by age three. Although brushing your pet's teeth removes plaque, brushing can't remove hard tartar.

During dental cleanings, your veterinarian uses special instruments to scrape plaque and tartar from the teeth above and below the gum line. Teeth are also polished to remove rough spots that collect plaque and tartar.

**Do Some Pets Need More Frequent Cleanings?**

Although pets generally need dental cleanings once a year, some benefit from more frequent cleanings. Factors that may mean your pet needs to visit the veterinarian for cleanings more often include:

  * **Crowded Teeth.** Brushing your pet's teeth removes plaque before it can become tartar. Unfortunately, it may be impossible to completely eliminate plaque if your dog or cat's teeth overlap. Persian cats, bulldogs, Boston terriers and pugs are more likely to have crowded teeth. Toy and small breed dogs also tend to have small mouths and crowded teeth.
  * **Oral Health Risks.** Some dog breeds are more likely to develop oral health problems than others. Dachshunds, boxers, greyhounds, and shelties may be at increased risk for gum disease and benefit from more frequent dental cleanings. Pets that have immune conditions may struggle to fight off bacterial infections and may need more than one cleaning per year.
  * **Age.** Tartar may build up on your pet's teeth more quickly as it ages. Wear and tear on teeth can also create nooks and crannies in teeth that trap plaque and tartar. Dental cleanings are particularly important for senior pets and shouldn't be stopped just because your pet is getting older.
  * **Oral Hygiene Habits.** Brushing your pet's teeth is a simple way to prevent plaque and tartar formation. Unfortunately, it may not be easy to convince your pet that tooth brushing is a good thing. Introducing an oral hygiene routine gradually can help, although some pets may still struggle to tolerate brushing. If your pet is a reluctant brusher, more frequent cleanings will keep plaque and tartar in check.



During your pet's dental visit, your veterinarian will discuss the ideal cleaning schedule for your furry friend.

**Why Anesthesia Is an Important Part of Dental Cleanings**

Before the dental cleaning begins, your dog or cat will be given general anesthesia. Anesthesia ensures that your pet remains still during the cleaning and allows the veterinarian to perform a complete cleaning and dental exam. Before the cleaning, blood and urine tests may be needed to ensure that your pet doesn't have any underlying health issues that could cause complications with anesthesia.

Your pet may be a little sleepy when it wakes up after the cleaning, but will probably be back to normal after a good night's sleep.

Is it time for your pet's dental cleaning? Contact our office to schedule a pre-cleaning exam.
