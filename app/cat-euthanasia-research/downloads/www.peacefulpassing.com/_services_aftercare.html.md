# Aftercare Options

At Peaceful Passing, we believe you should be able to decide every aspect of your pet’s transition between life and death. We understand that choosing what to do with your pet’s remains is an extremely personal decision, and we want to completely honor your wishes. Personal belief systems, cost, and local regulations can all affect your decision.

### CREMATION

**Private Cremation** – This option ensures that your pet is cremated individually and the remains are respectfully returned to you in an urn. Once you have the ashes, you can decide if you want to bury them, scatter them, or keep them inside an urn or other keepsake. Our private cremation clients have the choice of traditional flame-based creation or water-based (Aquamation). We do have limited availability for aquamation, so please ask your Peaceful Passing veterinarian if this is available in your area.

**Communal Cremation** – We also offer communal cremation options for a lower price. With this option, your pet is cremated with others and the ashes are ceremoniously spread on the crematorium grounds or another location.

### BURIAL

[Private Burial Laws](https://emergencyvetsusa.com/pet-burial-laws/)

**Private Burial** – If your city/county regulations allow, you can choose to bury your pet on your personal property. Please check local regulations to see if this is legal in your area.

**Cemetery Burial** – Many areas have pet cemeteries where you can bury your pet and mark the grave so you can visit when you want to pay your respects. If you want to bury your pet in a cemetery, you must usually make arrangements ahead of the euthanasia procedure. Please let your Peaceful Passing veterinarian know if you plan for a cemetery burial so they can make the necessary arrangements.

### OTHER OPTIONS

**Preservation** – Some people choose to preserve a lifelike reconstruction of their pet. If you are interested in this option, we recommend contacting a taxidermist to determine the most ideal method of storing your pet’s remains after passing. Please share this information with your Peaceful Passing veterinarian as soon as possible.

**Donation** – Some areas allow pet owners to donate their pet’s remains for research or teaching purposes. This method provides invaluable learning opportunities for future veterinarians and pet nurses. If you are interested in this method, please contact a veterinary teaching hospital or university prior to euthanasia to determine the best means of transportation. They might have questions for your regular veterinarian about your pet’s general health and diagnosis.

> “If there is a heaven, it’s certain our animals are to be there. Their lives become so interwoven with our own, it would take more than an archangel to detangle them.”   
>  — Pam Brown

> “Dogs come into our lives to teach us about love, they depart to teach us about loss. A new dog never replaces an old dog, it merely expands the heart. If you have loved many dogs your heart is very big. ”   
>  — Erica Jong

> “There is a sacredness in tears. They are not the mark of weakness, but of power. They speak more eloquently than ten thousand tongues. They are the messengers of overwhelming grief, of deep contrition, and of unspeakable love.”   
>  — Washington Irving

> “I should know enough about loss to realize that you never really stop missing someone-you just learn to live around the huge gaping hole of their absence.”   
>  — Alyson Noel

> “Dr Karen is the most compassionate and empathetic woman and Doctor. She is attentive, she is supportive and she is loving and kind. I would recommend Dr Karen to anyone who is in the midst of losing their animal. She included a ceramic paw print and an ink print. Dr Karen also took care of all our needs for cremation. What was the saddest day in many, many years, was made more comforting with the most amazing veterinarian I have ever met.”   
>  — Kari M.

> “I will never say goodbye any other way. Dr. Karen was an angel and we appreciate all she did for us during a very difficult time. We thank you with all our hearts for loving our fur baby so much.”   
>  — Kari L.
