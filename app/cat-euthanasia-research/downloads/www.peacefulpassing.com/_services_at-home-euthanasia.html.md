# At-Home Euthanasia

Everyone has to say goodby to their cherished pet in their own way, and Peaceful Passing tries to make the experience as loving and gentle as possible

## Our Euthanasia Procedure

At the beginning of the appointment, your Peaceful Passing veterinarian will spend some time with your pet to assess his/her condition. Through this assessment and a conversation with you, your veterinarian will determine the best way to proceed to honor your wishes and your pet’s needs. Please let your veterinarian know if you prefer to do the procedure in a certain area of your home, like by your pet’s favorite spot for napping, or if you want to create a certain atmosphere with candles and music.

We require you to sign a euthanasia consent form and pay for the appointment at the start of the visit.

Your veterinarian begins by sedating your pet with a small needle that is inserted just under the skin. Most animals do not even feel the sedative, although some might experience a very slight pinch. We use the sedative to keep your pet calm and comfortable. Within twenty minutes, your pet will fall into a deep and pain-free sleep.

We encourage you to sit with your pet and shower him/her with love and reassurance throughout the process, but we understand if you want to say your goodbyes before we begin the euthanasia process.

As your pet falls asleep, you might notice some of the following:

  * Twitching of the legs or ears
  * The urge to urinate or defecate
  * Open eyes
  * Deep breathing or gasping 



These are natural physical reactions and can take place whether death is natural or assisted and are no cause for alarm. Please ask your Peaceful Passing veterinarian if you have any questions at any point of the process.

Once your pet is comfortably and soundly asleep, your veterinarian will inject the last medication. Depending on your pet’s condition and size, the veterinarian will either inject it in the vein or the belly. This final medication causes peaceful unconsciousness that eventually leads to loss of respiration and, finally, stops the heart

You have the opportunity to spend as much time as you want with your pet once the euthanasia is complete. Please let us know if there is anything you need throughout any phase of the process. Our goal is to help your pet’s passing be as dignified, pain-free, and peaceful as possible.

> “If there is a heaven, it’s certain our animals are to be there. Their lives become so interwoven with our own, it would take more than an archangel to detangle them.”   
>  — Pam Brown

> “Dogs come into our lives to teach us about love, they depart to teach us about loss. A new dog never replaces an old dog, it merely expands the heart. If you have loved many dogs your heart is very big. ”   
>  — Erica Jong

> “There is a sacredness in tears. They are not the mark of weakness, but of power. They speak more eloquently than ten thousand tongues. They are the messengers of overwhelming grief, of deep contrition, and of unspeakable love.”   
>  — Washington Irving

> “I should know enough about loss to realize that you never really stop missing someone-you just learn to live around the huge gaping hole of their absence.”   
>  — Alyson Noel

> “Dr Karen is the most compassionate and empathetic woman and Doctor. She is attentive, she is supportive and she is loving and kind. I would recommend Dr Karen to anyone who is in the midst of losing their animal. She included a ceramic paw print and an ink print. Dr Karen also took care of all our needs for cremation. What was the saddest day in many, many years, was made more comforting with the most amazing veterinarian I have ever met.”   
>  — Kari M.

> “I will never say goodbye any other way. Dr. Karen was an angel and we appreciate all she did for us during a very difficult time. We thank you with all our hearts for loving our fur baby so much.”   
>  — Kari L.
