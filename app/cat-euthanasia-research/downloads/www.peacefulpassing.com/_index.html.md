# Peaceful, Compassionate At-Home Pet Euthanasia

Our pets enrich every aspect of our lives–often until they take their final breaths. Although it is never easy to say goodbye to our faithful companions, providing them with a pain-free and quiet passing surrounded by love is one small last gift we can give them.

It is our sincerest intention to help you make your pet’s final moments as calm and personal as possible. You can choose the location for your last goodbye – we will gladly perform the procedure by your pet’s favorite tree or next to a sun-soaked window. You are free to create your desired atmosphere with candles, music, or a group of family or friends.

The choice to free your cherished pet from pain is difficult, but it is also selfless. Peaceful Passing is here to help however we can.

### [Our Euthanasia Process](services/at-home-euthanasia.html)

[](services/index.html#euthanasia)

At Peaceful Passing, we know how difficult it is to make the decision to say goodbye to your pet. We do everything we can to make this emotional and challenging time as personalized and comfortable as possible.

During your appointment, your Peaceful Passing veterinarian will thoroughly assess your pet and talk to you about your wishes during and after the procedure. Please feel free to ask your veterinarian any questions you have about the process so you have a better understanding of each stage.

We use medication to make your pet comfortable as they peacefully fall into a deep sleep, and you have the option to be with them the entire time.

### [Deceased Pet Pick Up](/services/deceased-pet-pickup-new.html)

[](/services/deceased-pet-pickup.html)

Losing a beloved pet is a heart-wrenching experience and we extend our deepest condolences to you during this difficult time and if you're not sure what to do next, please reach out to us. We can arrange for home pick-up and transportation of your recently deceased pet to the crematorium for aftercare according to your wishes.

The cost for this transportation service is $175 if you are within the Clovis/Fresno metro areas. For locations outside these areas, a travel fee may be assessed.

Cremation, whether you wish to have the crematorium respectfully scatter your pet's ashes for you or you wish to have your pets returned to you, is an additional fee. The price depends on your pet's weight and the type of cremation you desire. Please refer to our [Pricing Page] for details.

We want to help you find solace and peace during this difficult time.

Please simply TEXT the following information to 559-313-6319:

  * Your Name
  * Your Address
  * Your pet's weight (lbs)
  * Type of Cremation You desire: 
    * (Individual) Ashes Returned to me
    * (Group) Ashes scattered by Crematorium



Please text this information to 559-313-6319 and someone will respond letting you know what time they can pick up and the cost to help you with your pet.

n the meantime, you may provide a sheet, light blanket or towel to cover and later help transport your pet. Protect your pet from direct sunlight and extreme heat if possible and prior to your veterinarian arriving, please provide parking to help facilitate transport. Your veterinarian will have a stretcher to assist with larger pets. Upon arrival, you will need to complete some simple paperwork and provide payment.

### Knowing When It's Time To Say Goodbye

Not sure when the time is right? How do I know when my companion animal is really suffering? Our goal is to create the most peaceful experience for families facing companion animal end-of-life issues. We are happy to consult with you about your beloved pet and friend. There are several resources to help you with this difficult decision. Your family veterinarian is a valuable resource who can help you decide when your pet is nearing the end of life, but we are also only a phone call or email away. The information provided here is meant to guide you toward an informed discussion with your veterinarian and family members about your pet’s quality of life.

The following Quality of Life Assessment questionnaire is a tool designed to help you make a more objective assessment of your pet’s overall quality of life.

> “If there is a heaven, it’s certain our animals are to be there. Their lives become so interwoven with our own, it would take more than an archangel to detangle them.”   
>  — Pam Brown

> “Dogs come into our lives to teach us about love, they depart to teach us about loss. A new dog never replaces an old dog, it merely expands the heart. If you have loved many dogs your heart is very big. ”   
>  — Erica Jong

> “There is a sacredness in tears. They are not the mark of weakness, but of power. They speak more eloquently than ten thousand tongues. They are the messengers of overwhelming grief, of deep contrition, and of unspeakable love.”   
>  — Washington Irving

> “I should know enough about loss to realize that you never really stop missing someone-you just learn to live around the huge gaping hole of their absence.”   
>  — Alyson Noel

> “Dr Karen is the most compassionate and empathetic woman and Doctor. She is attentive, she is supportive and she is loving and kind. I would recommend Dr Karen to anyone who is in the midst of losing their animal. She included a ceramic paw print and an ink print. Dr Karen also took care of all our needs for cremation. What was the saddest day in many, many years, was made more comforting with the most amazing veterinarian I have ever met.”   
>  — Kari M.

> “I will never say goodbye any other way. Dr. Karen was an angel and we appreciate all she did for us during a very difficult time. We thank you with all our hearts for loving our fur baby so much.”
