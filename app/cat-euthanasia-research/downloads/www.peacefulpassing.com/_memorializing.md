# Keeping Your Pet’s Memory Alive

The loss of a pet is a truly personal experience and memorializing your pet should be as well. There are many different ways to honor your pet’s life and the bond you shared, and you should choose the one (or many) that best represents your relationship and life together. 

Here are a few examples of ways you can keep your pet with you even after their physical body is gone:

### Perform a Symbolic Tribute 

Sometimes the ritual of a symbolic tribute is enough to expel your grief over your loss and start to see the path toward healing. A symbolic tribute can entail:

  * Releasing a memorial balloon
  * Planting a memorial tree in your pet’s honor
  * Making a donation to an animal welfare foundation in your pet’s name
  * Volunteering at a local shelter
  * Reading a poem that reminds you of your pet
  * Saying a prayer for your pet
  * Lighting a candle as you think of your pet



### Create a Visual Memorial 

Visual memorials make it easy to honor your pet’s memory and keep a part of them with you. Consider adding one of the following visual memorials to your space so you have something to look at when you start to really miss your pet.

  * Turn your favorite picture into a [canvas print](https://www.etsy.com/market/custom_pet_prints) and hang it up in a place of distinction
  * Create a memorial [stepping stone](https://www.etsy.com/market/pet_memorial_stones) for your yard or garden
  * Find a [beautiful urn](https://www.amazon.com/pet-urns/s?k=pet+urns) or locket for your pet’s ashes
  * Purchase a[ custom stuffed animal](https://cuddleclones.com/) made to look like your pet
  * Get a tattoo of your pet’s profile, paw, or nose print
  * Memorialize your pet’s ashes into [glass art](http://www.rainbowbridgehearts.com/)

> “If there is a heaven, it’s certain our animals are to be there. Their lives become so interwoven with our own, it would take more than an archangel to detangle them.”   
>  — Pam Brown

> “Dogs come into our lives to teach us about love, they depart to teach us about loss. A new dog never replaces an old dog, it merely expands the heart. If you have loved many dogs your heart is very big. ”   
>  — Erica Jong

> “There is a sacredness in tears. They are not the mark of weakness, but of power. They speak more eloquently than ten thousand tongues. They are the messengers of overwhelming grief, of deep contrition, and of unspeakable love.”   
>  — Washington Irving

> “I should know enough about loss to realize that you never really stop missing someone-you just learn to live around the huge gaping hole of their absence.”   
>  — Alyson Noel

> “Dr Karen is the most compassionate and empathetic woman and Doctor. She is attentive, she is supportive and she is loving and kind. I would recommend Dr Karen to anyone who is in the midst of losing their animal. She included a ceramic paw print and an ink print. Dr Karen also took care of all our needs for cremation. What was the saddest day in many, many years, was made more comforting with the most amazing veterinarian I have ever met.”   
>  — Kari M.

> “I will never say goodbye any other way. Dr. Karen was an angel and we appreciate all she did for us during a very difficult time. We thank you with all our hearts for loving our fur baby so much.”   
>  — Kari L.
