# Pet Loss and Grief Support

Losing a pet is often accompanied by an extreme depth of emotion that is hard to overcome. Our pets are not just animals to us. They fit perfectly into our lives and add not only companionship and fun, but also true joy. 

Sometimes people are surprised by how much the death of a beloved pet affects their mental and emotional well-being, but this grief is normal and common. You are entitled to feel whatever range of emotions you feel while processing the loss. 

Everyone experiences grief differently, and it is important to honor these feelings however you need to honor them. Self-care is an extremely important aspect of the healing process and can help you move through feelings of grief, guilt, or shame that you might be experiencing.

Here are some resources that can help you work through these feelings and get the support you need as you grieve the loss of your cherished companion:

### Preparation

If your pet is nearing the end of his or her life, you do not have to wait until after he or she has passed to start utilizing resources to help you through your pain. [Everlife Memorials](http://www.everlifememorials.com/v/pet-loss/anticipating-pet-loss.htm) provides resources that can assist you through every stage of the loss process from knowing when it’s time to saying goodbye to your visit with your Peaceful Passing Veterinarian.

### Children and Pet Loss

The loss of a pet is often the first experience a child has with losing a loved one. [This link](https://aplb.org/support/children_and_pet_loss.html) from the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine gives some important tips on helping your children deal with the loss of a pet.

Children experience different levels of emotional and cognizant development at different ages, which means their ability to really understand the concept of death changes based on how old they are. According to Marty Tously, who works as a bereavement counselor, you can expect children under five not to fully grasp the permanence of death but might have some changes in behavior (like thumb sucking) because they can feel the trauma around them. Children over five, however, will have different reactions. Learn more about [teaching your children about pet loss here](https://aplb.org/support/children_and_pet_loss.html).

### Surviving Pet Grief

Humans are not the only ones to experience grief when losing a pet. If you have other animals in your home, you might notice that they exhibit signs of mourning after losing another pet. [This article](https://healthypets.mercola.com/sites/healthypets/archive/2015/09/19/helping-surviving-pet-deal-with-loss.aspx) can help you assist your surviving pet(s) through the grieving process.

> “If there is a heaven, it’s certain our animals are to be there. Their lives become so interwoven with our own, it would take more than an archangel to detangle them.”   
>  — Pam Brown

> “Dogs come into our lives to teach us about love, they depart to teach us about loss. A new dog never replaces an old dog, it merely expands the heart. If you have loved many dogs your heart is very big. ”   
>  — Erica Jong

> “There is a sacredness in tears. They are not the mark of weakness, but of power. They speak more eloquently than ten thousand tongues. They are the messengers of overwhelming grief, of deep contrition, and of unspeakable love.”   
>  — Washington Irving

> “I should know enough about loss to realize that you never really stop missing someone-you just learn to live around the huge gaping hole of their absence.”   
>  — Alyson Noel

> “Dr Karen is the most compassionate and empathetic woman and Doctor. She is attentive, she is supportive and she is loving and kind. I would recommend Dr Karen to anyone who is in the midst of losing their animal. She included a ceramic paw print and an ink print. Dr Karen also took care of all our needs for cremation. What was the saddest day in many, many years, was made more comforting with the most amazing veterinarian I have ever met.”   
>  — Kari M.

> “I will never say goodbye any other way. Dr. Karen was an angel and we appreciate all she did for us during a very difficult time. We thank you with all our hearts for loving our fur baby so much.”
