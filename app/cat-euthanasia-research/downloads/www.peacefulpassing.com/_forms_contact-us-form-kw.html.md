> “If there is a heaven, it’s certain our animals are to be there. Their lives become so interwoven with our own, it would take more than an archangel to detangle them.”   
>  — Pam Brown

> “Dogs come into our lives to teach us about love, they depart to teach us about loss. A new dog never replaces an old dog, it merely expands the heart. If you have loved many dogs your heart is very big. ”   
>  — Erica Jong

> “There is a sacredness in tears. They are not the mark of weakness, but of power. They speak more eloquently than ten thousand tongues. They are the messengers of overwhelming grief, of deep contrition, and of unspeakable love.”   
>  — Washington Irving

> “I should know enough about loss to realize that you never really stop missing someone-you just learn to live around the huge gaping hole of their absence.”   
>  — Alyson Noel

> “Dr Karen is the most compassionate and empathetic woman and Doctor. She is attentive, she is supportive and she is loving and kind. I would recommend Dr Karen to anyone who is in the midst of losing their animal. She included a ceramic paw print and an ink print. Dr Karen also took care of all our needs for cremation. What was the saddest day in many, many years, was made more comforting with the most amazing veterinarian I have ever met.”   
>  — Kari M.

> “I will never say goodbye any other way. Dr. Karen was an angel and we appreciate all she did for us during a very difficult time. We thank you with all our hearts for loving our fur baby so much.”   
>  — Kari L.
