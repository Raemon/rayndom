## A whole team there for you.

With BluePearl Pet Hospice, you and your pet will have a full team on your side: supportive doctors, veterinary technicians, and care coordinators who are available to help if you have questions or your pet’s condition changes.

#### In-Home Quality of Life Consultation

## We walk you through it.

Understanding your pet’s illness and end-of-life needs can be overwhelming, which is why we’re here to guide you through it. We take each step with you, and the sooner we begin a relationship, the more you and your pet will benefit from our guidance and care.

#### In-Home Comfort Care

## Care in the comfort of home.

We share our skills and experiences to support you in making the most appropriate choices for your pet. Our focus is to return the center of care to your home while offering the best control of pain and symptoms.

#### In-Home Euthanasia

## Move at your own pace.

We understand saying goodbye to a pet is not an experience that can be rushed or limited to one hour, which is why we offer extended appointment times to allow you ample opportunity to discuss concerns and get to know us personally.

#### Cremation and Aftercare

## Quality care is in the details.

We take every little detail into consideration, no matter how small it seems, and help make your pet’s end-of-life journey as meaningful as the life they lived.

## Articles and resources.

**Learn about quality of life, pet loss support and everything in-between.**
