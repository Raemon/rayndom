## How do I know when it is time?

No matter how much thought and preparation we go through, the loss of a beloved pet will always be a difficult emotional experience. You know your pet best and you know when they are not acting normal or when their routine behavior has changed. Still, it can be hard to make a rational and objective assessment of how your pet is feeling. One way to judge your pet’s well-being is to ask yourself, “Does he or she still have the basic requirements for an acceptable quality of life?”

  * Being able to eat,
  * Being able to sleep or rest comfortably, and
  * Being able to get around – getting out of bed, making it to the litterbox or outside for a walk.



We often tell ourselves that we will just let nature take its course and hope that our pet passes away in their sleep. But nature is not always so kind and more often allows our loved-one to linger and experience a slow and unpleasant demise. We also tell ourselves that maybe we will wait until he or she is in great pain in order to make a decision. Logically, that is NOT something we want our pet to experience nor be our last memory of him or her. Rushing to end the life of a loved-one while they are crying in pain is exactly what we want to avoid. The kindest favor you can do for your pet is to assist them in having a planned, gentle and peaceful exit and minimize any pain or suffering.

## How far in advance should I schedule a visit?

Due to the unpredictable nature of an illness, it can be difficult to anticipate the course of events. Sometimes our patients decline faster than expected and sometimes they surprise us by suddenly improving. Once you feel that final day is soon approaching, it would be best to schedule a date and time that suits your needs. Many of our requests are for “same day” visits and our schedule can fill up very quickly. You are always welcome to cancel or reschedule the appointment up to 2 hours before the arrival time should circumstances change one way or the other. Please review our cancellation policy here.

## What happens during a visit?

Upon arrival to your home, we will choose a familiar place that is comfortable for you and your pet. We recommend having something washable and absorbent for them to lie on such as a blanket or towel. The first step is to create a calm and relaxed environment by administering a sedative. This sedative is achieved with a quick injection or two that might cause momentary discomfort. For this reason, we sometimes recommend holding your pet briefly wrapped in a towel or blanket. After 10 to 15 minutes, your pet will be relaxed and quiet, as in sleep, and less aware of his or her surroundings. The euthanasia injection is another “sleeping” drug that is administered into a vein. This last injection is given slowly but has immediate effects. Within seconds the breathing stops and the heart ceases to function. Upon passing there can be minor flow of body fluids, such as urine or saliva, and the eyes may remain partially open. Very rarely, even after death, the diaphragm or “breathing muscle” will sometimes hiccup involuntarily. Overall, this process appears very quiet, gentle and peaceful without signs of struggling or discomfort. The doctor will then confirm that your pet has passed.

## Should my children or other pets be present?

This is a very common question that can be difficult to answer. It depends on the age and maturity of your child, as well as your religious and cultural beliefs. We are not psychologists, but we believe it is never wise to lie to your child about what is happening to your, and possibly their, beloved pet. Current recommendations suggest giving your child the option of being present or not, based on their own wishes. Despite the tears and sadness surrounding the event, your child will eventually recover and likely be even better mentally-prepared for future losses having survived this experience.

As far as having other pets present, it is hard to know what goes on in the mind of a companion pet at the time of euthanasia. We have never witnessed an obviously “negative” reaction and it is likely they have already become aware that something has changed once the companion pet becomes ill. As above, we recommend allowing other pets the option of being present or not, according to their wishes. We also support the idea of allowing the surviving pet to witness the body afterwards in the small chance that they can experience some form of “closure”. Either way, the surviving pet is expected to go through an adjustment period of a week or two – looking for their missing companion and possibly even vocalizing.

## How do I prepare for this event?

There really isn’t much you need to do in preparation for a visit. Continue caring for your pet – feeding and medicating – as usual. We will bring any necessary supplies. If your pet is likely to be anxious or fearful of a stranger in the house, you might want to **request a strong oral sedative medication from your regular veterinarian to give one to two hours before our arrival.** You may also want to notify and invite family or close friends, discuss the event with your children, review the options for aftercare (cremation, burial, keepsakes, etc.), choose some music to play in the background, take pictures and video. If time allows, you may want to consider creating **Advanced Directives** for your animal companion – click here for more information.

## What if I change my mind?

We know this is a very difficult, even painful, decision to make and you are under NO obligation to go through with the euthanasia process. If circumstances change or if you simply change your mind, you are welcome to cancel or reschedule up to **2 hours before** the appointment time. If you need to cancel less than 2 hours before your appointment time or if we arrive to your home and mutually decide to postpone the euthanasia, we feel that $250 is fair compensation for our time. Please review our cancellation policy here.
