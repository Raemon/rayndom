### **Rainbow Bridge Vet is Now Permanently Closed**

After 25 years, Rainbow Bridge Veterinary Services, one of (if not THE) first veterinary practice dedicated solely to in-home end of life care for pets has permanently closed. We are honored and proud to have been of service to the community, as well as thankful and humbled to be able to be included in the care and transition of so many wonderful pets over the past quarter century.
