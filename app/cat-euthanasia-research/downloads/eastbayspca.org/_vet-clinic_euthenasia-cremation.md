# Euthanasia/Cremation

It is never easy to say goodbye to a pet. [Theodore B. Travers Family Veterinary Clinic](https://eastbayspca.org/vet-clinic) offers end of-life services by appointment only. To schedule an appointment, call (510) 569-1606.

For dogs and cats who have already passed away, we offer after-care services on a walk-in basis. We do recommend calling before arrival so that our team is prepared to assist quickly.

The after-care services include options of the following:

  * **Communal Cremation** : Cremains are spread on a private property in Northern California by Koefran

  * **Private Cremation** : Pets are individually cremated. The cremains are carefully gathered and placed in a finished cedar urn and returned to the Theodore B. Travers Family Veterinary Clinic for pick up.

  * **Clay Paw Print** : An imprint of a pet's paw is taken in clay and twice fired in a kiln to create a quality keepsake with a stand. Multiple color options are available. The keepsake is returned to the Theodore B. Travers Family Veterinary Clinic
