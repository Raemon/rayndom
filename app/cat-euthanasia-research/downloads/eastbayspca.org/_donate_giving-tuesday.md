# Giving Tuesday

### **Special Giving Tuesday Match: Twice the Support for Vulnerable Animals!**

To celebrate **Giving Tuesday** —a global day of generosity—an anonymous sponsor is matching all donations to East Bay SPCA, dollar for dollar up to **$50,000!**

This is your chance to do even more for vulnerable animals in our community, so please send in your support **before midnight on December 2!** Any amount supports our mission to be More Than A Shelter, offering affordable, holistic, leading-edge pet support to keep animals with people who love them.
