Daniela Lungu devotes her law practice to asset protection through estate planning. Ms. Lungu’s goal is to provide her clients with the most personalized legal services possible, in a friendly and approachable way.

Like many attorneys, before opening her own law firm, Ms. Lungu was a highly accomplished businesswoman, in various areas of management and areas of specialty. Additionally, her mediation and conciliation practice spanning over two decades in California, assisted her in transition into law and allows her to offer a safe and comfortable experience for her clients to discuss their utmost concerns. Each client is provided with an individually tailored estate plan, geared to meet goals and concerns. Daniela believes in a holistic approach to planning, so and ensuring all members of the family are cared for, including all your pets.  
We look forward to having you join us for this informative session!
