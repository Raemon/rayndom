# Local Animal Groups

Below are links to public and private shelters and rescue groups in the Bay Area.

Organizations marked “Public” serve surrounding community and are the proper place to bring a lost or stray animal.

As of July 1, 2025, the City of Livermore is partnering with East Bay SPCA to provide compassionate care and shelter for stray and abandoned animals. This webpage will be updated with more details throughout the month of June 2025.

As of January 20, 2021, the City of San Leandro has moved its animal shelter services from Fremont to East Bay SPCA to better serve San Leandro residents. East Bay SPCA will provide shelter services for strays or lost animals found in incorporated San Leandro without appropriate identification at the Oakland Shelter located at 8323 Baldwin Street in Oakland.
