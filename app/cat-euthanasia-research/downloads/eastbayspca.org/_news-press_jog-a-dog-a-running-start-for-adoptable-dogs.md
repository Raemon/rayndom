# Jog-a-Dog: A Running Start for Adoptable Dogs

February 10, 2025

### One day, in September of 2012, a runner (and dog-lover) named Amy sent an email to the East Bay SPCA with an idea: what if shelter dogs could join her for weekend runs? The concept was met with an enthusiastic “Yes!”—and not just for her. Our Behavior & Training (B&T) team saw an opportunity. What if more volunteers could do the same? And just like that, Jog-a-Dog (JAD) was born. 

Amy partnered with two members of the B&T team, and together, they created a program that would give shelter dogs much-needed exercise, enrichment, and socialization—all while helping them find forever homes. From September 2012 to early 2013, Amy and her team carefully planned the program, recruited volunteer runners, and trained them to jog safely with their four-legged companions. By February 2013, the first official jog took place in Dublin. And in 2017, the program expanded to Oakland, bringing even more wagging tails into the mix.

The joy of Jog-a-Dog is that it’s for everyone. While most volunteers are experienced runners, some are beginners who simply love the idea of helping a shelter dog stretch their legs. Each week, volunteers sign up for shifts—weekday runs have room for two runners, while weekends can accommodate up to five.

But how do they know which dog to jog with? The Shelter Manager and Shelter Medicine Manager carefully select JAD Candidate dogs—dogs that are fully vaccinated, healthy, and eager for a little adventure. Volunteers gather before each shift, discussing which dog is the best fit for their pace and experience level. And sometimes, Amy comes prepared with thoughtful pairings, ensuring both runner and pup have the best experience possible.

Over the years, Jog-a-Dog has led to countless unforgettable moments. In 2024, for example, JAD volunteers and their canine companions swapped their usual jog for an exciting event—the Devil Mountain Run in Danville. Not only did they complete the 5K together, but they also cheered on community runners (and their dogs!) in the Buddi Love Dog Mile, met families at the Kids Fun Run, and shared East Bay SPCA‘s mission with a whole new audience. It was such a success that they hope to return to it in 2025!

Amy dreams of taking JAD even further. She envisions a large-scale East Bay SPCA Fun Run/Walk 5K fundraiser, where volunteers and shelter dogs can jog side by side with the community. She also hopes to rekindle partnerships with local businesses, like Sports Basement in San Ramon, to promote the program and encourage adoptions.

Through all its years, Jog-a-Dog has welcomed dogs of all sizes, breeds, and energy levels. While some volunteers prefer a speedy running buddy, others enjoy a more leisurely jog with a slower-paced pup. Regardless of the match, each dog gets the same wonderful benefit: fresh air, exercise, and the joy of human companionship while they wait for their forever home.

Of course, running with dogs requires awareness. Volunteers are trained to watch for signs of stress or excitement, to give plenty of space to other runners and dogs, and to always prioritize safety. The golden rule? Keep a 10-foot distance from other joggers and pups to ensure a smooth and enjoyable run.

When asked what the most common feedback is from participants, Amy doesn’t hesitate: Camaraderie. Amy shared, “Something I hear (and see) frequently from JAD program volunteers are words (and actions) of communication, collaboration, and support that exemplify strong teamwork and community. This is a recurring component of every shift that presents in an abundant variety of heartwarming ways and extends to include shelter staff as well. “

As for the most frequently asked question? People always want to know how many dogs participate. In 2024 alone, 124 dogs joined the program—some running just once, others logging dozens of jogs. The record-holder? A pup, named Dash, ran 49 times before finally trotting off to their forever home. From a simple email to a program that has changed hundreds of lives, Jog-a-Dog continues to thrive, proving that a little exercise, a little teamwork, and a lot of heart can make a world of difference for shelter dogs. And with each run, the dream grows bigger—one paw print at a time.
