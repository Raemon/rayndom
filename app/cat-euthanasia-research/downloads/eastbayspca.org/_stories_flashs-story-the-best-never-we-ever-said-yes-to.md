# Flash’s Story: The Best ‘Never’ We Ever Said Yes To

Aug 16, 2025 

We adopted Flash (formerly known as Wyclef) in July of 2017, so coming up on 8 years with him this month! He was around 4 or 5 years old at the time and the sweetest little guy. My mom swore up and down that the only breed she would never adopt was a chihuahua, but my sister and I begged to meet him after he jumped up and pawed at the glass. When he ran straight to my dad (a couple of days later, when we brought him back to meet Flash after placing an adoption hold), we knew it was meant to be.

Now he’s around 13 years old, has moved with us from California to Texas, and has only had one encounter with a skunk!

Flash is now a spicy, OLD chihuahua/pomeranian (according to the DNA test) who doesn’t really like other dogs, people, environments, etc., but he is the absolute best addition to our family that we could’ve ever imagined. He is so sweet and loves cuddles, scraps from the table, and sleeping in the sun. He now has two sisters that he tolerates, and his favorite place is someone’s bed (or a beanbag).

Likewise, he has a love-hate relationship with his orange ball and will eat everything except for spinach. Thank you, East Bay SPCA, for saving this angel and letting us bring him into our lives!
