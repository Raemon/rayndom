### Do you love animals? Do you want to make a real impact on the lives of dogs, cats, and people in your community?

At East Bay SPCA, we’re more than a shelter—we’re a community of dedicated individuals working together to make a difference. We’re teachers, trainers, builders, advocates, artists, veterinarians, vet techs, and so much more—all unique, but united by a love for animals and a shared mission to nurture the human-animal bond and make compassionate care accessible to all.

If you’re looking for a place where your passion meets purpose, where you can bring your authentic self, and where every wag, purr, and happy adoption reminds you why you do what you do—this is it.

**Be part of something bigger.**

## About Our Veterinary Environment

Our veterinarians and medical professionals at our Theodore B. Travers Family Veterinary Clinic are truly saving lives every single day.

Our full-service veterinary clinic runs part like a general practice, and part urgent care. Our team regularly evaluates new and unique cases and diversifies their skill sets by treating referrals, stray animals, and performing high-volume/high-quality spay and neuter surgeries at our Spay/Neuter Centers.

We also see and treat animals referred to us by local partners who are aware of the individual or pet owner’s financial limitations. Our veterinarians are trained to think creatively and provide options to clients that may not have many others.

-

Northern California is one of the most sought-after locations in the world. Relocation is worth the miles traveled when your backyard is a wonderland!

The Bay Area is home to some of the most incredible wildlife, parks, and people in the country. The diversity of the East Bay means you can find any type of food, fun or activity you could want. We are a hub of world-class eateries, independent businesses, entertainment and concert venues, and an eclectic collection of museums and cultural centers.

Located just three hours shy of Lake Tahoe and Mount Shasta and just minutes from the bay, living here means that you really can visit the snow and surf in the same day if you want to. Hop in your car and enjoy the ocean from different vantage points from the hills of Oakland, in San Francisco, or Marin Headlands. Drive up the coast to the Redwoods, Russian River Valley, or stunning Mendocino. Locally, Napa, Sonoma, and wine country are just an hour north of Oakland.
