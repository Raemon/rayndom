# Calico Crew – Jr. Vets [Oakland]

## November 30, 2025 @ 10:00 am \- 11:30 am

Our updated Shelter Scouts youth program, Calico Crew allows 8-11 year olds to explore animal care through games, crafts, and supervised meet-and-greets with shelter animals. Participants can join one or multiple modules. Each module will include safe, supervised, hands-on animal interaction.

**Jr. Vets**

So many young people express wanting to become a veterinarian when they get older. Here’s their chance to learn more about this noble profession and try some hands-on activities to bolster their skills!
