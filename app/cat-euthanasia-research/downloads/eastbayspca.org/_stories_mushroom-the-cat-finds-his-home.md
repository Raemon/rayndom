# Mushroom the Cat Finds his Home

Sep 22, 2023 

“We adopted Mushroom on August 5, 2023. My husband and I initially went to the Dublin Adoption Center to check out another kitten, but Mushroom caught my husband’s attention. After reading his adorable bio, we decided to meet him, and it was a match made in Cat Heaven.

Mushroom has been such a fantastic companion and baby for our household. He adjusted quickly when we brought him home for the first time. He loves playing, cuddling, and exploring different nooks and corners of our apartment. He loves to climb his cat tower and neighbor watch. He loves taking long naps, either on his tower or our couch. He is a very social, calm, and curious cat. We love him so much and are so happy that he’s part of our family!

The staff were so lovely and hospitable to us. They allowed us to meet different cats and kittens before we fell in love with Mushroom. Their adoption process is straightforward, and they provided us with the information we needed for Mushroom.”

-Danica, Adopter
