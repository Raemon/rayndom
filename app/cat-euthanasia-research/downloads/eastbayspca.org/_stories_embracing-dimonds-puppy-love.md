# Embracing Dimond’s Puppy Love

Jan 14, 2024 

Dimond is a fast learner. We were able to teach him to sit, down, and come in a matter of minutes. Some of his favorite activities are going out in the rain, discovering new things, and digging escape tunnels. He is such a sweetie and always runs, tail-wagging to greet people at the door. He relaxes in the car and makes these adorable little puppy noises. He has tons of energy for about twenty minutes. After that, it’s nap time. Dimond talks and moves in his sleep. He loves the outdoors and all the smells in it. He is such a sweet puppy and we cannot wait to go on so many more adventures with him. Everyone at the SPCA was extremely helpful and nice when we were fostering and adopting.
