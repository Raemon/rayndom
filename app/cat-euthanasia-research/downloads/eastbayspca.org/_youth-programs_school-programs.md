The Bark Program is a six-week, intensive after-school program run by East Bay SPCA in collaboration with [Oakland Unity High School](https://www.unityhigh.org/) in East Oakland. Its aim is to give youth and canines a voice. The program teaches persistence, empathy and respect for all living beings through a combination of dog training and humane education. During the program, students learn about social justice, community issues, public speaking, conflict resolution, animal welfare, and positive reinforcement dog training.

With the guidance of the program staff, students work in a group to train East Bay SPCA shelter dogs. The students work together to teach their dogs basic commands such as sit, watch, down, touch, and even fun agility tricks like jumping through hula hoops. The dog’s new manners and familiarity with commands help them become better candidates for adoption with most dogs in the program quickly adopted after graduation.

East Bay SPCA offers educational visits to our Oakland and Dublin Adoption Centers, to give visitors a behind-the-scenes glimpse of our services and teach an appreciation for all living beings.

The Providing Animal Welfare at the Shelter (PAWS) Experience is perfect for any group wanting to visit our facility (age 5 to adult), including school groups, scout groups, community service clubs, and more.

**What does the PAWS Experience include?**

This is a 90-minute program, including a 60-minute behind-the scenes tour (with one dog meet-and-greet). The tour will be preceded by a 30-minute guided project for your group to give back to the shelter animals (making adoption posters, making toys for our dogs/cats, etc). This program is a great way for your group to learn about the mission of our shelter, as well as give them the opportunity to lend a helping hand.  
The program fee is $150. We can accommodate a maximum of 30 participants. If you have a larger group wishing to attend, we may be able to offer two separate programs at the same time to accommodate. SCHOLARSHIPS ARE AVAILABLE!

**Cancellation Policy**

For cancellations made more than a week prior to the program date, a refund (minus a $25 administrative fee) will be granted. For cancellations made less than a week prior to the program date, no refund will be issued and the entire program fee will be forfeited.

**School Scholarships**

Schools applying for scholarships will be automatically awarded a scholarship that matches the percentage of students at the school who are eligible for the Free and Reduced Price Meal Program (FRPM). FRPM percentages are determined using the most recently published statistics provided by California Department of Education.
