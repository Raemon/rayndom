# East Bay SPCA Pharmacy

[SHOP YOUR PET PHARMACY](https://eastbayspca.ourvet.com/pet/)

### Choosing our local pharmacy service means you're not only supporting a trusted, community-based provider. Here's what makes our service exceptional: 

### **Shop Local, Spend the Same**

Our pricing is competitive with major online pet pharmacies, so you can feel good about shopping local without sacrificing affordability. You get the best deal while staying with a provider who personally knows your pet.

### **Smart Integration with Medical Records**

Our pharmacy is directly connected to your pet’s medical records. That means fewer delays, no redundant paperwork, and an added layer of safety. We automatically screen prescriptions to make sure they’re safe and appropriate for your pet’s specific health needs.

### **Automatic Manufacturer Rebates**

We help you save even more by automatically applying eligible manufacturer rebates to your prescriptions. No need to clip coupons or fill out forms.

### **Custom Compounded Medications You Can Trust**

Not all pets are the same, and not all medications come in a one-size-fits-all solution. That’s why we offer compounded medications, tailored to your pet’s needs — whether it’s a special flavor, dosage, or form. Compounded in trusted facilities, they’re safe, effective, and made with your pet in mind.
