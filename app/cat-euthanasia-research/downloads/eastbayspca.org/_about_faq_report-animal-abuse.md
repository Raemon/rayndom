# Report Animal Abuse

If you see an animal being abused or neglected, immediately report it to the nearest public animal control agency.

Please note: East Bay SPCA is not a government-funded agency, and does not have jurisdiction to investigate, uphold or enforce laws related to cases of animal cruelty.

**What are some signs that an animal is being abused or neglected?**

Some signs of animal abuse are easily seen – such as witnessing someone hit their animal or leaving them in a hot car. Animal neglect, however, is harder to determine. Please see Signs of Animal Abuse for more details on [what to look for before you call animal control](https://eastbayspca.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/EBSPCA_SignsAnimalCrueltyNeglect.pdf).

  
**What do I do if I see an animal being abused or neglected?**

Investigations of potential animal abuse are handled through local animal control agencies. While we work to eliminate animal cruelty, neglect and overpopulation by providing programs and education, the East Bay SPCA has no legal jurisdiction or investigative resources to uphold or enforce laws related to animal abuse.

**Before you make the call** [please read these tips](https://eastbayspca.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/EBSPCA_AnimalAbuseReportingTips.pdf) to ensure that you have prepared all the necessary information before contacting the appropriate agency.

Please note: California law makes it illegal to leave an animal unattended in unsafe conditions, to fight animals, or to chain up animals! [Learn more about the laws](https://eastbayspca.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/EBSPCA_CALawsAnimals.pdf).
