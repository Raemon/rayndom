# Calico Crew – STEM at the Shelter [Oakland]

## December 7, 2025 @ 10:00 am \- 11:30 am

Our updated Shelter Scouts youth program, Calico Crew allows 8-11 year olds to explore animal care through games, crafts, and supervised meet-and-greets with shelter animals. Participants can join one or multiple modules. Each module will include safe, supervised, hands-on animal interaction.

**STEM at the Shelter**

Calling all animal-loving scientists and engineers! This session will intentionally incorporate STEM strategies to benefit Calico Crew members’ sense of wonder and to help shelter animals on their journeys to adoption
