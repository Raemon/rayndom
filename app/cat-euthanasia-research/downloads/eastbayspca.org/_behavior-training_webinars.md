[ Clicker Training 101 ](https://eastbayspca.learnworlds.com/course?courseid=clicker-training-101)

For decades, the scientific community has agreed–training using positive reinforcement (often abbreviated as R+) is the most effective, ethical, and humane way to communicate with our animals. Clicker training has so many applications; helping to attain specific training goals, enriching the lives of our animal learners, and building stronger bonds of communication and understanding between animals and their guardians. We are excited to offer this interactive module as an introduction to positive reinforcement training. These are the building blocks that you can use to begin your training journey!

This module will walk you through the most basic foundations of R+ training, and provide you with the skills you need to begin to explore training for yourself–whether this is with a shelter animal as a volunteer or foster, or with your own critters at home.

This course contains five (5) interactive modules and four (4) section quizzes.
