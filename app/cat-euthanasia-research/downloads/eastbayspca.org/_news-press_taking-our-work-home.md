# Taking Our Work Home

September 17, 2025

## From the shelter to the living room

Our staff dedicate their days to ensuring every animal receives compassionate care and a chance for a happy future. While their work is rooted in a deep commitment to animal welfare, sometimes the bond they form with a dog or cat becomes something special. On those occasions, the people who nurture animals on their journey to adoption become adopters themselves — and give a loving home to the very companions they served.

### Alissa, _Client Services Representative_ , Buddy & Shadow:

Alissa’s family first grew in September 2022 when they adopted Buddy, a shy pup that Alissa, a Customer Services Representative, spotted in our care. This little gem slowly revealed his fierce loyalty and love with time, training, and patience — thanks in part to East Bay SPCA’s Behavior & Training team. Two years later, Shadow joined the family after what was supposed to be just a weekend “sleepover” from the clinic; once Alissa’s husband met the affectionate, confident pup, there was no chance he’d be going back. Now, the two dogs balance each other perfectly, Buddy learning bravery with Shadow by his side, and Shadow soaking up every chance to give kisses, lounge, and tag along with his mom to work — making them the sweetest duo.

### Amal, _Animal Care Coordinator,_ and Alanna

Mini cattledog mix Bubbles arrived from Hawaii at just four months old with an injured leg. Even after healing, she remained shy and hesitant, often hiding in her crate. With patient care, treat trails, and encouragement from staff and volunteers, she slowly ventured out. Amal, Animal Care Coordinator, quickly became smitten: “I started taking her for [foster] sleepovers, where she napped on the couch and tried to persuade my ten-year-old cat, Idris, to play by dropping toys in front of him. He preferred supervising instead.” Though adopters showed interest, weeks passed and Bubbles’ bond with Amal grew. By April, Amal officially adopted her, renaming her Alanna. Now Alanna is a confident, playful pup who alternates between “gremlin mode” and “Parisian model.” She squeaks toys with glee, watches birds with Idris, and fills their home with joy, love, and lessons about bravery in a big world.

### Brittany, _Shelter Medicine Registered Veterinary Technician,_ and Shoopy

Brittany had her heart set on adopting a kitten, and when Shoopy was the only one available, she instantly knew this tiny, adorable friend was meant to come home with her. Over the past 15 years, Shoopy has been Brittany’s “soul cat,” sharing every chapter of her life — from college and new homes to marriage, pregnancy, and raising kids — always with the same sweet, calm, and loving personality she had as a kitten. In 2021, Shoopy was diagnosed with lymphoma, and while Brittany doesn’t know how much time they have left together, she treasures every moment, grateful for the unwavering companionship of the cat who has truly become the heart of her family.

### Elizabeth,_Registered Veterinary Technician,_ and Jackpot & Honey

Elizabeth first met Jackpot in the Clinic while he was being neutered, and couldn’t help but think he was adorable. After some time in foster, she spotted him again on the adoption floor as she was searching for a new dog. Though she was second in line, she lucked out when the first family passed due to his dog-selective personality, and Jackpot came home with her. From the start, he proved to be an obedient, loyal, and easygoing companion — settling in right away and becoming her best friend and travel buddy for the past eight years. A couple of years later, during the early days of the pandemic, Elizabeth brought home Honey for a sleepover during shelter-in-place, and her family quickly fell in love. Honey has grown into a sweet, food-loving Labrador who’s still a little shy with strangers but warms up fast and adores attention. Together, Jackpot and Honey have brought joy, laughter, and unconditional love into Elizabeth’s home.

### Jasper,_Animal Care Coordinator,_ and Toeby

Jasper’s life changed when they adopted Toeby, a spunky little polydactyl kitten who had once been known as Stellar at the shelter. Jasper had seen intake photos of Toeby and his littermates early on, immediately drawn to the kittens with extra toes. Toeby’s gregarious, outgoing personality stood out from the rest, and it was love at first sight. Jasper knew instantly that he was the one who belonged in their home. Now just over five months old, Toeby has blossomed into a spirited and playful kitten, full of energy and charm. He loves to pester his big sister Bug, who is still adjusting to having a another cat in the home but slowly warming up to him. Between bursts of play, Toeby’s softer side shines through; he’s quick to curl up with his family for cuddles, asking for attention with his sweet little merps. For Jasper, raising Toeby has been especially meaningful, as he’s the first cat they’ve cared for from kittenhood!

### Joseph, _Shelter Medicine Manager,_ and Katt & Tiger

Joseph, Shelter Medicine Manager, first met Katt in 2011 when she was brought in as a stray at just four weeks old, nestled among a litter of newborn kittens that inspired her name. Over the past 14 years, she has grown from a playful pup into the proud “sheriff” of the household, keeping everyone in check with her steady presence. More recently, in 2022, Joseph welcomed Tiger into his family — a decision that felt destined from the start. With his joyful bark and wagging tail, Tiger brings an instant smile to Joseph’s face, no matter how the day unfolds, making both pets treasured parts of his journey with East Bay SPCA.

### Dr. Josie, _Shelter Medicine Veterinarian,_ and Panini (aka Nini)

Our Shelter Medicine Veterinarian Dr. Josie first met Panini (affectionately called Nini) just before Christmas. The shelter was preparing to close for a few days and the little pup had come down with kennel cough, landing her in isolation. Drawn in by her sweet face, and a desire to ensure the pup wasn’t alone over the holidays, Dr. Josie decided to foster her through the break, but it quickly became clear that Nini wasn’t going back — her family had already fallen in love. Because she was initially quite fearful and shy, her first days at home were spent hiding behind tables and chairs. With love and patience, Nini soon blossomed into a confident, social, and joyful companion. Now, she is the very embodiment of happiness — always enthusiastic, ready for adventure, and eager to make friends with dogs, cats, and people alike.

### Dr. Katherine,_Spay/Neuter Veterinarian,_ and Baldr

Dr. Katherine, our Spay/Neuter Surgery Center Veterinarian, was hoping to find a companion for her husband after the loss of his childhood cats. She sent him a photo of two available kittens — and he immediately chose Baldr. When she and her husband got to meet Baldr in person, the tiny, orange kitten with a pink nose instantly stole their hearts. The moment her husband held him, Baldr purred and snuggled in as if he already knew he was home. Though a little shy at first, nesting under the bed, Baldr’s playful love for shoelaces, lasers, and treats soon brought him out of his shell. Now a sweet and cherished member of their family, he has filled their home with joy and love.

### Lilibeth, _Registered Veterinary Technician,_ and Luca Miliani

For months, Lilibeth, Registered Veterinarian Technician at our Oakland Clinic, had been searching for the right dog, waiting for that undeniable spark of connection. When she met Luca Miliani, it was love at first sight. From the very beginning Miliani has been a sweet, affectionate snuggle bug who insists on being the center of attention, soaking up cuddles and making it clear she prefers to have all eyes on her. Though she sometimes gets a little selfish with having to share the attention, her precious mix of traits only makes her more endearing, she’s truly one of a kind — a perfect match for Lilibeth’s heart and home.

### Lisa, _Oakland Shelter Manager,_ and Poppy

When a tiny stray pup weighing less than two pounds arrived at East Bay SPCA with her little, mask-like markings, the team named her “Bandit,” certain she would steal someone’s heart — and she did. Lisa, our Shelter Manager at our Oakland campus, wanted to give the little dog some comfort, and invited her into her office, where their bond quickly began to grow. Lisa decided to bring her home to see how she fit into her life. The playful pup bounced happily in front of her, and Lisa suddenly blurted out, “You’re popping so much — you’re a little Poppy.” From that moment, the name stuck, and so did their family. Two years later, Poppy is still her spunky, shoulder-perching bestie with a long list of affectionate nicknames, and Lisa wouldn’t have it any other way.

### Meghan, _Office Manager,_ and Autumn

Meghan first met Autumn in 2024. Se came in as a shy pup, and something about her gentle, golden-retriever-like presence immediately tugged at her heart. Though quiet and reserved, Autumn reminded Meghan of the beloved golden retriever she grew up with, and after a short foster stay to ensure she fit in with their two bonded cats, Meghan and her boyfriend knew Autumn was meant to stay. At first, Autumn was nervous, fearful of dogs, and hesitant even on neighborhood walks, but with patience, love, and support from the Behavior & Training team, she began to grow in confidence. Today, Autumn has blossomed into a joyful, silly, and affectionate companion who greets each morning with kisses, loves new adventures, has gained a few dog friends, and shares a sweet, heartwarming bond with her kitty sisters.
