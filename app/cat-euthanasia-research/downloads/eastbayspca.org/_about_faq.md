How is East Bay SPCA funded? 

+

-

East Bay SPCA is a non-profit organization funded entirely by private donations, foundation grants, bequests and fees for service. **East Bay SPCA is not affiliated with any other SPCA or Humane Society including ASPCA and HSUS.** Our tax ID number is 94-1322202.

How do I make a donation? 

+

-

You can donate online, call our fundraising staff at 510-563-4604, or mail us at 8323 Baldwin Street, Oakland CA 94621. We encourage you to learn about [other ways to give](https://eastbayspca.org/how-to-help/ways-to-give/more-ways-to-give), including donating household items and shelter supplies to East Bay SPCA.

How do I adopt an animal? 

+

-

Come to any of our two facilities (Oakland or Dublin) to visit with our cats and dogs looking for a new home. Be prepared to spend quality time meeting your new companion and speaking with our Animal Care Associates about the cat or dog you select. Visit our [Adoption Process](https://eastbayspca.org/adopt/adoption-process) page to find out what you should bring when you visit and other details.

How do I surrender an animal? 

+

-

Finding a new home for your pet can be an emotional and difficult decision. Learn the options so you can make sure your pet’s next home is the right one. East Bay SPCA accepts cats and dogs from individuals who can no longer care for them. Our ability to take in dogs and cats changes continuously. Find out more about [rehoming a pet](https://eastbayspca.org/resources/rehome-or-surrender-a-pet).

I’ve lost my dog or cat. What should I do? 

+

-

Visit our [Lost/Found/Stray Pets](https://eastbayspca.org/resources/lost-found-stray-pets) page to see if someone has turned in your pet to East Bay SPCA. If not:

  1. Look around your neighborhood and talk with your neighbors.
  2. Search when it is quiet and use their name when calling your pet. Your pet may be hiding, hurt or frightened, so look under bushes and other such objects.
  3. Put up posters and distribute flyers with a photo and description of your pet. Give enough information to describe your pet and where it was lost, but don’t give them every bit of information.
  4. Visit [Oakland Animal Services](http://www.oaklandanimalservices.org/) or your local animal control agency and look at the animals to see if your pet has been impounded. [Oakland Animal Services](http://www.oaklandanimalservices.org/) holds strays for a certain period of time. File a lost pet report and go back daily for several weeks to see if your pet turns up.



I’ve found a dog or cat. What should I do? 

+

-

Visit our [Lost/Found/Stray Pets](https://eastbayspca.org/resources/lost-found-stray-pets) page. If you have taken in a lost cat or dog, thank you for getting him or her off the street. Contact [Oakland Animal Services](http://www.oaklandanimalservices.org/) or your local animal control agency and file a found dog or cat report. You can provide care for that animal until their owner contacts the agency. If you have found a cat/kitten, view our resources on stray cats, feral cats, and kittens.

Is East Bay SPCA a “no-kill” facility? 

+

-

We have found that “no-kill” has come to mean so many different things. As such, we choose not to use that term to describe our facilities or policies. The animals that are accepted into our adoption program are kept, cared for, fed, and socialized and/or trained as long as they remain adoptable, i.e. healthy and sociable. There is no time limit for their stay. Animals are euthanized if they are too aggressive to be safely placed in a home or too ill to be rehabilitated.

What do I do if I see an animal being abused or neglected? 

+

-

Investigations of potential animal abuse are handled through the local animal control agency. Learn more about the [process of reporting animal cruelty or neglect](https://eastbayspca.org/about/faq/report-animal-abuse).

Where do I get my dog licensed? 

+

-

Each city has its own requirements and fees for dog licenses. Visit our [Licensing](https://eastbayspca.org/resources/licensing) page for more details.
