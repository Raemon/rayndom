# How East Bay SPCA is helping Southern California Animals Affected by the Fires 

January 13, 2025

Sunrise on the way to LA 

The wildfires in Southern California are taking a heartbreaking toll on animals and communities. At East Bay SPCA, we are actively participating in measures to ensure safe transport of animals as needed, with the focus being support for the shelters and their staff on the front lines of this ongoing crisis.

Our VP of Operations is a member of the [CalAnimals](https://www.calanimals.org/) Emergency Management Committee. As a part of this committee, she is in daily meetings with shelters in the impacted areas, listening to their needs. This lead to our recent involvement that included an early morning trek for two of our staff. On Sunday, our team hit the road at 5 AM, driving to the Los Angeles County Animal Care Center in Lancaster. We returned with 10 dogs—9 large and 1 small—giving them a new chance at finding a home, while freeing up vital space in Southern California shelters for more pets in need. “Every kennel counts in a crisis like this,” Our VP of Operations shared. “We’re glad this transport could create space for more animals and relieve some of the pressure on neighboring shelters.”

This effort is more than transportation; it’s about hope. With shelters overwhelmed, our work helps staff focus on serving their communities while ensuring displaced animals receive the medical care, safety, and compassion they need.

### **How You Can Help Here****—Big Dogs Need Big Hearts**

Large dogs are often overlooked for adoption, and we need adopters now more than ever. The dogs we’ve welcomed from LA will be ready for adoption starting Wednesday, January 15. Every adoption opens another space to save an animal and frees up more resources to help communities impacted by the fires.
