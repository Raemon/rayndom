If your pet has a medical condition not listed above, please email us before scheduling to determine if they qualify to have surgery done at our Spay/Neuter Center. Booking with a known pre-existing condition could lead to loss of deposit on surgery day. If your pet does not meet the requirements for surgery at our Spay/Neuter Center, you must have the surgery done at either your regular veterinary clinic or our Theodore B. Travers Family Veterinary Clinic. To schedule an appointment, please call (510) 569-1606.

**Aggressive or Special Handling**

To proceed with surgery, we must be able to safely handle your pet. If your pet is aggressive towards strangers or cannot be handled for any reason, please let us know before the appointment so that we can better advise if your pet is a candidate for our surgery center. When safety, or your pet’s well-being becomes a concern, we will be unable to proceed with surgery. Be aware there are additional fees for special handling.

We STRONGLY recommend that your pet be up to date on vaccinations prior to their surgery appointment for their protection as well as the protection of other animals coming into the facility. Please discuss appropriate vaccinations with your regular veterinarian ahead of time. If you are unable to vaccinate your pet before surgery, please let us know at check-in and we can provide vaccines at an additional cost on the day of surgery.

Popular Pup Program

**Popular Pup Program**

All spay/neuter surgeries are available by appointment only and are limited to a maximum of two per day, scheduled on a first-come, first-served basis.

Pitbulls, German Shepherds, and Huskies are prominent in pop culture and because of this, we see them frequently in shelters. Their energy and abundance for life may not be the appropriate fit for every family, causing these breeds to spend more time waiting in shelters, which is not optimal for dogs needing a regular mental and physical outlet. To help prevent unwanted litters that may enter the shelter system, East Bay SPCA offers a discount program towards spay/neuter procedures.

**Qualifications**

Pet owners/pets who meet the requirements below may qualify for a 25% discount off the spay/neuter surgery fee.

  * Owner must be a resident of Alameda or Contra Costa county.
  * Dog must LOOK like a Pit Bull, German Shepherd, or Husky. This is at the discretion of our veterinarian.
  * Must be an owned dog. No rescue groups, foster organizations, shelter animals, or stray dogs.
  * Must meet the spay/neuter surgery requirements.
  * Discount can only be used for two pets per household per year.
  * Only the spay/neuter surgery fee is discounted. Additional procedures and/or fees are at regular cost. Please [see our pricing list](https://eastbayspca.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Spay-Neuter-Center-Prices2023.pdf) for additional procedures and fees.



If the dog does not qualify for the program, then the surgery fee would be at our regular prices.

## Meet Our Veterinarian

Dr. Katherine Swanson is originally from Harvey, Louisiana and has always loved all animals. At the beginning of her career, she attended an SPCA sponsored program known as Vets for the Future where she was trained at a young age to treat common parasites, diseases, medications, treatments, and suture techniques. Through this program she developed a love for veterinary care and decided to become a veterinarian at only 14 years old. After she graduated from Mississippi State University in Biology, she went on to complete her Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree in May 2017 from Mississippi State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine. She has worked solely as a small animal veterinarian, focusing on dogs and cats, but found her love in surgery, deciding to make it her full-time focus. During her free time, she typically enjoys crafting of all kinds, from crocheting, knitting, sewing, drawing, and painting (both on canvas and with miniatures). Her furry family consists of her cats Miyu and Baldr, and her dog, Winston.
