# Leash Reactivity Seminar [Oakland]

## August 10, 2025 @ 9:30 am \- 1:30 pm

# Leash Reactivity: Train for Emotional Change

## 

## **Seminar & Training Demo **

**Does your dog bark or lunge on walks?** We all want our pets to feel safe outside the home. One of the most common challenges for pet owners, **leash reactivity** can be easy to curb – with the right knowledge.

Learn from veterinarian and accomplished dog trainer Dr. Sophie Liu as she dives into the **emotional root behind dog reactivity** , and offers science-backed, practical solutions to take your dog from chaotic to calm. An **in-depth seminar** investigates why your dog reacts the way they do, and a **live training demonstration** shows leash-reactivity training in real-time.
