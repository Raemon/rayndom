# From LA to East Bay: Adoptable Dogs Find New Beginnings 

January 23, 2025

Heading out to retrieve 12 dogs from impacted areas of Southern California.

Last Friday, January 17, The East Bay SPCA welcomed 12 adoptable dogs airlifted from Southern California, as part of wildlife relief efforts coordinated by [Greater Good Charities](https://greatergood.org/). “We’re taking adoptable animals and those already in the shelters prior to the fires beginning in Southern California, ensuring we’re not separating displaced pets from their families,” said Lisa Hammock of East Bay SPCA. These 12 dogs are in addition to the 10 dogs we transferred from LA County days prior.

Shelter vans parked side by side, working together in our aligned missions.

This rescue effort brought together animal welfare organizations across Northern California, including East Bay SPCA, the Humane Society of Sonoma County, Marin Humane and Pets in Need. Volunteers and staff worked side by side to transfer the dogs into transport vans, ensuring these furry friends made their way to new shelters as smoothly as possible. It was a heartwarming moment of solidarity, underscoring the shared mission to help animals in need.

The rescue did not stop in Northern California—some dogs continued their journey to Oregon Humane Society, further expanding their chances of finding loving homes. East Bay SPCA’s involvement in this critical mission highlights its unwavering commitment to saving animal lives, both locally and beyond.

### How You Can Help 

Large dogs in particular often face longer waits for adoption. By adopting one of these “[Big Dogs](https://eastbayspca.org/adopt/adopt-a-dog),” you can make room for more animals in need. All dogs with the Big Dog badge or the LA Wildfire Friends banner on our website currently have waived adoption fees, making it the perfect time to find your next best friend. 

If adoption isn’t an option, consider joining our flexible foster program. Providing a temporary home gives these dogs much-needed rest and socialization after their long journey. 

This airlift is just the beginning; with animals in Southern California continuing to be impacted by this tragedy, shelters across the West Coast are poised to provide critical support as needed. Together, we can give these animals the second chance they deserve.
