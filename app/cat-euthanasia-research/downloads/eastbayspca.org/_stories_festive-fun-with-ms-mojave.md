# Festive Fun with Ms. Mojave

Oct 29, 2023 

  
Our new pet holds a special place in our hearts because she started off as an incredibly shy kitty. During our visit to the SPCA, we initially considered another cat but didn’t quite bond with it. It was then that my mom spotted a black and white cat, exclaiming how cute she looked. Inquiring with the staff about this particular kitty, we learned about her shyness. The staff placed her in a small room with us, and even though she initially ran and hid, we knew she was the one. I’d like to express my gratitude to the East Bay SPCA staff, especially the person who assisted us on that day. Your support has been invaluable, and I’m forever thankful for the role you played in bringing our shy kitty into our lives.
