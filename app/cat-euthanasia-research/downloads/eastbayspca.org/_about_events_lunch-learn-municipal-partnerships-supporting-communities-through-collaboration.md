# Lunch & Learn | Municipal Partnerships: Supporting Communities Through Collaboration

## July 16, 2025 @ 12:00 pm \- 1:30 pm

East Bay SPCA is dedicated to strengthening animal welfare throughout our region by building meaningful partnerships with local city governments. Together, we deliver essential services that support both animals and people throughout our East Bay communities.

•

We invite you to join us on Thursday, July 16 at noon via Zoom for a special conversation with East Bay SPCA staff Karalyn Aronow, Vice President of Operations, and Lindsay McCall, Director of Shelter Operations.

•

During this session, they will share updates on our longstanding municipal contract with the City of San Leandro, introduce our new partnership with the City of Livermore, and discuss our ongoing efforts to support animals in Oakland, particularly as the city continues to feel the impact of the recent budget crisis.

•

These partnerships exemplify the power of collaboration between cities and nonprofits, and how working together can create positive outcomes for the pets and people we serve.
