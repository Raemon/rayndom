# The Heart Behind the Healing: Vet Team Appreciation Week

October 13, 2025

Each October as the nation celebrates Veterinary Technician Week, we take the opportunity to shine a light on all the amazing veterinary work being done at East Bay SPCA. Our Shelter Medicine, Spay/Neuter Surgery Center, and Theodore B. Travers Family Veterinary Clinic teams deserve to be applauded for their focus on helping animals and their dedication to advancing animal welfare every day. 

To dive in more deeply, we asked our veterinary staff at each location to share reflections about what drives and inspires them. Their responses convey the scope of the meaningful work they’re doing and how it goes beyond “treatments” and is rooted in love, teamwork, and the joy of being a part of an animal’s healing journey. 

So much love goes into the work!

### **Just what makes a job in the veterinary field so rewarding?**

For animal lovers it’s an easy answer: when saving and improving lives, the reward is huge! That’s not the only piece of the puzzle. There are opportunities to help underserved communities ensure their pets get the care they need; our staff help to educate pet parents and see them through the good times and the more challenging ones.

When asked what the most rewarding part is for her, Dr. Cruz, a veterinarian at our full-service Clinic, said: “Helping owners understand my recommendations, diagnostic results, and disease processes so they feel more involved and helpful with managing their pet’s health. **This strengthens the human-animal bond.** ”

Every animal gets specialized treatment.

Our Spay/Neuter Surgery Center does an amazing job with their finely tuned work, sometimes performing up to 30 procedures in a single day! Kelsea, Spay/Neuter Supervisor, shared her pride in their ability to provide support that benefits the whole community, both people and pets: **“We have the capability to offer low-cost services and lessen the pet population,”** she said, adding, “The whole team is wonderful.”

Aligning with that sentiment, Jessica, a Veterinary Client Services Representative, shared: **“It’s deeply rewarding to be able to help families take care of their pets and to be able to help offer solutions for them.** Also amazing to see animals improve through the course of care, and even if they don’t improve, to be able to offer support and kindness to families.”

At the end of the day, all of this adheres to our mission of getting more pets the care they need.

To show up each day and perform this deeply meaningful work, our staff all seemed to share a sentiment that their teams are truly wonderful and that keeps them going. When asked, Esme, a Registered Veterinary Technician that works both in Shelter Medicine and at our full-service Clinic, spoke about what helps keep her going: “The Shelter Med team! Couldn’t do this emotionally and physically demanding job without them!” At the Vet Clinic, Dr. Gadd agrees: “The support and positive vibes everyone shares with each other, the patients, and their caregivers” make it all the more joyful to provide care to animals and their families.

Our pride in the work these teams are doing is immense. We are so glad to have this opportunity to shine a light on the work they do every day and to acknowledge how impactful it is to animals and the families that love them.

## Bravo to all of our veterinary staff!
