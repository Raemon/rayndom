The staff at East Bay SPCA helped me to find a kitty who was the perfect match – confident, savvy, curious, and eager to get to know his brother! After a long introduction process, they are both getting along great! Playing, cuddling, grooming, and loving each other's company! 

##  [ Volunteer Turned Pet Parent: Apollo’s Adoption Tale ](https://eastbayspca.org/stories/apollo-the-dog)

Feb 2, 2024 

When I started volunteering at the EBSPCA, I had a long talk with myself. I knew I'd want to adopt all of the dogs. I convinced myself I had the will power to only volunteer. Epic fail!!! I saw Apollo on the website and he stole my heart. When I peeked in the kennels before my shift and he whined at me, it was a done deal! –Jackie Thomason

"We recently adopted a beloved German Shepherd puppy named Grizzly. We renamed him Dimond, after the park we live near. After fostering him for only three days, we realized we couldn’t give back the late night snuggles and exciting adventures that come with his adorable little face. We were not planning on getting a dog any time soon, but his puppy love won us over." –Liora

"We formed an instant bond. She loves being petted and scratched, and has the most adorable meow. Beyond that, she's incredibly playful—a fun-loving goofball that brings so much joy and laughter into my life. I'm truly grateful she's now a part of my household, and I wouldn't hesitate to adopt from East Bay SPCA again." - Katarina, Adopter

"From the moment I wake up to my return home, Goatee (formerly Lance) consistently shares his thoughts with adorable meows, whether in my arms or anticipating a belly rub. His charming white puff under his chin led to the affectionate name Goatee. Demonstrating remarkable intelligence, he's currently mastering the art of fetching with a bouncy ball. And speaking of excellence, the compassionate staff at the shelter truly stand out, pouring their love and care into matching animals like Goatee with wonderful forever homes." - Gabriella, Adopter
