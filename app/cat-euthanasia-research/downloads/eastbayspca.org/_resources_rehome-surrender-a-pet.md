# Rehome/Surrender a Pet

East Bay SPCA works hard to support owners who want to keep their pets. We recognize that housing and behavior can pose a challenge. We have compiled the suggestions below and ask that pet owners make every attempt to work out a housing or behavioral solution, or [try to rehome your pet](https://eastbayspca.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Alternative-Rehoming-Options.pdf), before considering the last resort: [surrendering your pet.](https://eastbayspca.org/resources/rehome-surrender-a-pet/surrendering-your-pet)

Please note, due to bandwidth, our current ability to schedule appointments is limited. Evaluation appointments are typically scheduled several weeks in advanced. We encourage you to utilize private rehoming or the resources below to help rehome your pet.

## Housing Challenges

People are sometimes forced to move. If you have recently lost your home or need to move, these suggestions may help you find housing to accommodate you and your pet. If needed, see our [Crisis Boarding](https://eastbayspca.org/resources/crisis-boarding) information.

Resources for Finding Pet-Friendly Apartments 

+

-

[People with Pets](https://peoplewithpets.com/) is an online database of apartments with pet-friendly policies.

[Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/), [Trulia](https://www.trulia.com/) and [Craigslist](https://sfbay.craigslist.org/) all have pet friendly filters on their search engines, as do the following:

[Lovely Apartment](https://livelovely.com/)  
[HotPads Oakland](https://hotpads.com/oakland-ca/apartments-for-rent)  
[RentLingo.com](http://www.rentlingo.com/)  
[Zumper.com](https://www.zumper.com/)  
[HomeSuite](http://www.yourhomesuite.com/)  
[Abodo.com](https://www.abodo.com/pet-friendly)  
[ApartmentList.com](http://www.apartmentlist.com/ca/oakland)  
[ApartmentGuide.com](http://www.apartmentguide.com/apartments/California/Oakland/)  
[RentCafe](http://www.rentcafe.com/sitemaps/us/ca-pet-friendly-apartments/)

There is also a [Bay Area Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/675101949191873/about/) that posts places that are pet friendly only as well as those with pets looking for housing. Keep in mind this is a closed group, so you will need to request to be added to the group in order to see the listings or to post if you are looking for pet friendly housing.

Consider Alternative Arrangements 

+

-

  * Temporary boarding might be the solution.
  * Ask family and friends for help. Spread the word about your situation and you may be surprised to who steps up to help out. People are often willing to share your situation through word-of-mouth but also via social media tools such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.
  * If you are experiencing a short-term crisis creating a temporary inability to care for pets, learn more about our [crisis boarding](http://experiencing a short-term crisis creating a temporary inability to care for their pets) program.
