# Calico Crew – All About East Bay SPCA [Oakland]

## August 31, 2025 @ 10:00 am \- 11:30 am

Our updated Shelter Scouts youth program, Calico Crew allows 8-11 year olds to explore animal care through games, crafts, and supervised meet-and-greets with shelter animals. Participants can join one or multiple modules. Each module will include safe, supervised, hands-on animal interaction.

**All About East Bay SPCA**

The activities will vary based on the facilitator and the group of participants. Each session will include a behind the scenes tour, at least one hands-on animal interaction (appropriate animal permitting) and activities that illustrate East Bay SPCA’s mission and how we serve cats, dogs, and people in our community.
