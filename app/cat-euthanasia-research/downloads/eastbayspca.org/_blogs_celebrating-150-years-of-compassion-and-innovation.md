# Celebrating 150 Years of Compassion and Innovation

Jan 25, 2024 

It’s hard to believe that we’re celebrating our 150th anniversary this year! Our organization, founded by a group of Oakland residents concerned about the treatment of horses and oxen, has evolved into one that envisions a more compassionate world for both people and companion animals. 

Throughout this year, we are celebrating the innovative spirit of our organization and you, our community, that continues to support us along our journey. We’re More Than a Shelter, we’re a leader in animal welfare and we look forward to continuing our legacy in the years to come.

As far back as **1912** we were leading the pack, hosting tours and programs for community members to learn about the humane treatment of animals. This past year, over **6,200** area children took part in our camps, scout, and other Humane Education programs at our Oakland and Dublin campuses.

### _Did you know?_ In**1962** , we were the first animal shelter in the Bay Area to require adopted animals to be spayed or neutered.

Our Humane Education programs promote compassion, empathy, and respect for all living things.

In 1961, we opened one of the nation’s first veterinary departments to treat shelter animals. Now, we also provide vaccines, spay/neuter surgeries, and other veterinary services to the public at both our Theodore B. Travers Family Veterinary Clinic and our Oakland Spay/Neuter Surgery Center. In fact, our Spay/Neuter Surgery Center was the largest of its kind in the United States when it opened in 1997!

Since the beginning, we have dedicated ourselves to serving the needs of our community in creative ways. From providing services for pets to training future veterinarians, we have always been deeply committed to members of our community, furry and otherwise.

As we celebrate 150 years of lifesaving, we’re so proud of our history as a leader in transforming the care of shelter animals. We are committed to continuing this legacy and finding new ways to save lives, keep pets and people together, and serve our community.
