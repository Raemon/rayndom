# How to Help

## Enrich the human-animal bond

Your support of East Bay SPCA directly impacts the thousands of dogs and cats that come through our doors each year, right here in our community! During their stay at our shelter, animals receive expert medical care, behavior training, loving attention and opportunities for play and socialization. It takes a community of volunteers, fosters, and donors to do this.

As the year concludes, we invite you to join us in creating stories of hope and transformation. For nearly 150 years, your support has fueled East Bay SPCA's innovative animal welfare solutions. Your contribution will make a real impact and ensure that the animals in our care receive the attention they deserve during the holidays and beyond.

Thank you for your compassion and hope.
