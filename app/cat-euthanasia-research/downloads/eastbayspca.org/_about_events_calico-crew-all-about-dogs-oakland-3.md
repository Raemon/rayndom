# Calico Crew – All About Dogs [Oakland]

## February 8 @ 10:00 am \- 11:30 am

Our updated Shelter Scouts youth program, Calico Crew allows 8-11 year olds to explore animal care through games, crafts, and supervised meet-and-greets with shelter animals. Participants can join one or multiple modules. Each module will include safe, supervised, hands-on animal interaction.

As the name suggests, this session is about everything DOGS! Activities will touch on topics ranging from dog body language, how to safely meet a new dog, breed identification, enrichment, positive reinforcement training, and more!
