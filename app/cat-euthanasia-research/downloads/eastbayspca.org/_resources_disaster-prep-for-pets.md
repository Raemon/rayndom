# Natural Disaster Prep for Pets

To make sure that your furry family members are safe during earthquakes, floods and fires, East Bay SPCA urges pet owners to include their animals in the family disaster plan.

Remember: Animal behavior can change in a disaster or high stress situation. Approach animals (even your own) with caution. Watch for signs of distress and use good judgment.

Keep Up to Date with Identification and Vaccines 

+

-

It is important to have up-to-date identification for your pet at all times.

  * Make sure your pet wears ID tags on its collar.
  * Microchip your pet. Our Veterinary Clinic and Spay/Neuter Center offer microchipping for just $20.
  * Make sure your pet is up-to-date on all vaccinations.



Plan Ahead 

+

-

When a disaster happens, you may not be able to get home to retrieve your pet. It is essential that you have someone (preferably a neighbor) who can enter your home to retrieve your pet and disaster kit. This person should be familiar with your animals so that they can safely get them to you, or house them temporarily.

  * Have a leash or carrier ready
  * Keep a list of nearby pet boarding facilities, shelters, and veterinarians.



Create a Pet Disaster Kit 

+

-

Don’t forget your pets when preparing your family’s waterproof disaster supply container. Each animal in your household should have the following items:

  * Food and water (for at least 7 days) and bowls
  * Carrier for each pet for temporary housing, especially in public spaces (in case of evacuation)
  * A small light that can attach to a pet’s collar in case of blackout
  * Blankets and towels for bedding
  * Medication(s) – include a small ice chest if they need to be refrigerated
  * Poop bags
  * Extra collars, leashes or harnesses (with id tags)
  * Litter pan, litter and scoop
  * Garbage bags for waste, and cleaning supplies
  * Paper towels
  * Re-sealable plastic bags
  * Photos of your pet, veterinary records, pet description sheet, and microchip information in a sealed plastic bag
  * Pre-made “Lost” poster in case you and your pet(s) are separated
  * Pet first-aid kit
  * A muzzle if needed



Be Prepared for Fire 

+

-

In Case of a Fire: Place a decal on the window indicating number of and type of pets for responders, and keep collars and leashes near an entrance. If pets are home alone, make sure they are in areas that are easily accessible. Also make sure pets (especially young pets) are kept away from fire-starting hazards. Consider purchasing and installing smoke detectors that will contact a monitoring center so you can be reached if your home and pets are at risk.

Evacuation 

+

-

If your home is not safe for you, it is not safe for your pet. In case of evacuation, take your pets with you. Many temporary evacuation spaces require pets to be on a leash or in a carrier, but some do not accept pets at all. If you are required to evacuate for a long period, identify a home that will welcome you and your pets or keep a list of pet friendly hotels with your disaster kit.

If you find yourself at a temporary shelter where other animals and their owners are also seeking safe-haven, make sure that you keep your pet safe by avoiding exposure to diseases. If your dog is aggressive or reactive toward people or other dogs, make sure that you also bring a muzzle.

Natural Disaster Pet Emergency Boarding 

+

-

In the event of a natural disaster, we are prepared to take in and board pets at our Oakland location for anyone who may have lost their home or is being evacuated. For more information and to request boarding in the event of a natural disaster, please contact [shelterleadership@eastbayspca.org](mailto:shelterleadership@eastbayspca.org). If you are experiencing a short-term crisis creating a temporary inability to care for their pets that is not caused by a natural disaster, check out our [crisis boarding program](https://eastbayspca.org/resources/crisis-boarding).
