# Private Dog Training

In addition to our robust [dog training classes](https://eastbayspca.org/behavior-training/dog-training/dog-training-classes), the East Bay SPCA also offers private training sessions, currently available online via Zoom and in-person at both locations. In these sessions, one of our trainers will observe and work closely with you and your dog and make recommendations for training and management plans.

**Awaiting an opening in our Private Training or Calm, Cool, and Collected class, or want to get a head start on the course material?** Our 40-minute "[Dog Reactivity Basics](https://eastbayspca.learnworlds.com/course?courseid=dog-reactivity-basics)" introductory webinar is perfect for you. Available in both English and Spanish for $35.
