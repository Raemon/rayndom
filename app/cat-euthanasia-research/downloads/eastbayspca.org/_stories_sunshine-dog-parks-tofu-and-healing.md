# Sunshine, Dog Parks, Tofu, and Healing

Jul 25, 2025 

My family and I lost our 16-year-old Jack Russell Chihuahua, Lally, last month. We adopted her from East Bay SPCA Oakland over 10 years ago. We weren’t sure we were ready for a new pup, but I knew SPCA wouldn’t be a bad place to stop by. Since it did give us our Lally girl. All the signs pointed to Agave once we walked into the kennels. He looked like her, and there was this Winnie the Pooh stuffy in his kennel that gave me the only sign I needed.

We gave him the name Tofu. He has completely come out of his shell and isn’t that shy and timid pup we first brought home. We have this spacious backyard he loves sunbathing in, he loves our family walks, and he can’t wait for his almost daily trips to our local dog park. He’s been a joy to our family and just the energy we all needed.

As I mentioned before, I adopted my previous pup 10+ years ago, and this time around, the staff and everyone at the shelter have made the process so smooth and easy. You can see how much they love the pups, and it shows. We love Oakland East Bay SPCA.

## Tofu living his best life!
