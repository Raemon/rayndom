# Ways to Give Old

Your support of East Bay SPCA directly impacts the thousands of dogs and cats that come through our doors each year, right here in our community. During their stay at our shelter, animals receive expert medical care, behavior training, loving attention and opportunities for play and socialization. It takes a community of volunteers, fosters, and donors to do this!

Every contribution results in greater chances to create connections that enrich the human-animal experience every day!

## Double Your Impact: Discover Donation Matching

Double the Donation is a unique initiative aimed at amplifying the impact of your generosity. Many organizations, offer donation matching programs as part of their corporate social responsibility efforts. Such programs effectively double the contributions made by their employees to eligible nonprofits like East Bay SPCA. This means that for every dollar you donate, your employer may contribute an additional dollar, effectively doubling the support for our mission to rescue, rehabilitate, and rehome animals in need and enrich the human-animal bond.

To see if your employer participates in donation matching, simply enter your employer's name below to determine if your donation to East Bay SPCA qualifies for matching funds. It's an effortless way to maximize the impact of your support and ensure that every dollar you give goes even further in helping animals in our care. Join us in making a difference today!
