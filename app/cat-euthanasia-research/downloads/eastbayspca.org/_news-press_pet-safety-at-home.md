# Pet Safety at Home

December 29, 2025

### **Even the most well-trained animals can get loose from their leash, or slip out of a yard, especially when something exciting catches their eye.**

Our Behavior & Training team shared their expert advice on pet safety at home, outside, and in unpredictable environments.

These resources and more are available through our [online training library](https://eastbayspca.org/behavior-training/behavior-training-library).

The Right Gear

### **Reliable walking equipment is your first line of defense against escape and a lost animal:**

**Harnesses over flat collars** — by far the safest option.

**Leave out head collars** , retractable leashes, and flexi leashes. All three of these are prone to failure and can lead to injury.

**Properly fit martingale collars** if harnesses are not an option. The provide more security than regular flat collars.

Petsitters & Walkers

### **Trusting your animal to a new person is a big responsibility, and you’ll want to make sure that their temporary caretaker has everything they need to keep your pet safe:**

**Set up a meet-and-greet** so your animal can get to know a new carer, and launch the new relationship when you’re sure your pet is comfortable.

Make sure anyone caring for your pet has all the relevant information they need in writing: behaviors, routines, medications, food, and veterinarian contact. A responsible caretaker will want to know **your animal’s needs**.

Trust your instincts, and **advocate for your animal**! If you are feeling uneasy about something your caretaker is doing or saying, or if you can tell your animal is uncomfortable, be their advocate and be firm about your expectations.

For the Outdoor Explorer

### **These precautions are important for avoiding escape and injury. Here are some tips to consider whether enjoying a yard, park, or other shared, public space:**

**Choose long lines** to mimic off-leash time for dogs who do not have reliable recall. Biothane leashes are durable, cleanable and won’t burn hands.

**Fence height:** Most medium-sized dogs have the ability to jump a 5′ fence. Larger dogs (55+lbs.) can often scale 6′ fences. 4′ – 5′ fences are not adequate to stop the majority of dogs from getting out.

**Fence opacity:** Can your dog see through the fence? If so, they are more likely to see something they will attempt to get to! A cat, a squirrel, a friendly human, another dog.

**Supervision:** Dogs left unsupervised in yards are more likely to have opportunities to escape, especially if boredom is a factor. If possible, have a way to supervise your dog while in your yard, especially at night.

**Routine enrichment:** We can’t just expect the yard to do the work for us, any more than we can put a child into a classroom and expect them to entertain themselves. Dogs need things to do, or they may find their own activities, which could involve escape to somewhere more exciting. We have a Canine Enrichment Handout with lots of ideas for keeping dogs busy and  
entertained

Vacation Precautions

### **Traveling with pets can be stressful, but there are steps you can take help minimize difficulties during a journey:**

Create positive associations with your pet’s **crate or carrier** before your trip, and make sure you are choosing carriers with high safety ratings.

**Research your route.** Make sure you know as much as possible about any place you’re staying. Pet friendly lodgings all have different requirements, and knowing what is offered ahead of time is ideal.

Research and **test behavior medications** ahead of time. Getting the dosage and administration right with your vet can make all the difference on the go — packing string cheese can be the difference between a calm pet and a difficult night’s sleep.

**Bring extra supplies!** Food, water, blankets, cleaner, litter —it’s far better to have too much than to run out.

If flying, research up-to-date **airline requirements.** All airlines are different, and policies change frequently.
