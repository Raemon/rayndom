# A Cat’s Tale of Survival

December 3, 2025

## How Love and Luck Lead Bonnie Back Home

When a good samaritan found Marsha hiding under a car, her paws were raw and red. She was badly burned, with large portions of her ears and face also injured. As San Leandro Animal Control got to the scene, Marsha required patient coaxing and gentle handling to get her into a carrier. Marsha arrived at our Oakland shelter the next day, stable after an overnight visit to an emergency vet, but not yet out of the woods.

Incredibly, she was able to walk and was even soliciting pets from staff. Marsha’s resilience was notable from the start, though her healing journey was far from over. “She was understandably in quite a lot of pain, but a sweet cat from the moment she showed up,” said Dr. Josie Noah, Shelter Veterinarian.

Marsha wasn’t microchipped, and the story behind her injuries remained a mystery, even as we created a treatment plan for returning her to full health. Her second- and third-degree burns were soothed with mānuka honey treatments and bandaged for protection while our foster team found the perfect home for her to recuperate in. Whether she was climbing on her vets or flicking her tail in an almost communicative way, Marsha’s spunk was undeniable.

Like us, Marsha’s first foster, Jessica, fell in love fast, and was determined to learn more about this spirited survivor. While volunteering at the Red Cross, she asked her local chapter about fire-impacted individuals who’d come in around the time of Marsha’s rescue. She was introduced to Stacey, who had lost everything when her home caught fire, including — she thought — two cats.

A camera roll full of photos of Marsha confirmed that her owner had indeed been found. We learned Marsha’s actual name was Bonnie, and that her brother, Clyde, didn’t make it. Bonnie had traveled more than ten miles after escaping the fire. Stacey made immediate arrangements to visit the family member she thought she’d lost.

While Stacey navigated the devastation and challenges of losing her home, Bonnie healed in the care of fosters Jessica and Menghsin. After multiple surgeries to remove burned skin, months of recovery, and regular checkups with our veterinary staff, Bonnie was finally ready to head home for good. While Stacey’s living situation remained in flux, we knew she was committed to Bonnie’s health and happiness.

As Bonnie’s final check-up wrapped up, familiar faces from the shelter stopped in to say goodbye, and wish Stacey well on the road ahead. Before leaving, our Humane Advocacy team gathered a bundle of supplies to help ease the transition — everything Bonnie might need to stay healthy and comfortable. A week later, Stacey sent photos of Bonnie perched in a soft carrier, about to explore the park in her teal harness: “Took Miss Bonkers out to touch some grass yesterday! Ultimately, she decided that she likes the indoors, I think… an excellent decision!”

## More Moments with Bonnie

Staff, volunteers, and fosters alike became enamored with Bonnie during her long healing journey. 

Bonnie arrived with severe second- and third-degree burns. Bandaging and mānuka honey treatments provided protection and encouraged healing. 

Foster care gave Bonnie time to rest, heal, and recover from her trauma. Her fosters sent us regular updates on her progress and affectionate personality. 

Reuniting Stacey and Bonnie in Oakland — once her healing was complete, Bonnie was able to go home at last, having traveled many miles and touched many lives.
