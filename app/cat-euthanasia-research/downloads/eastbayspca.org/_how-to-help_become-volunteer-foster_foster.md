# Foster

Spacing: small 

People who foster save the lives of many pets. We currently need foster parents for large dogs and kittens, as well as people who are willing to take a dog on a “field-trip” outing or host them for a “sleepover.”

## Animals Needing Foster Care

Fostering a pet from East Bay SPCA not only gives them a temporary home filled with love but also creates space in the shelter for more animals in need. When you open your home to foster an animal, you become a vital member of a team dedicated to enriching the human-animal bond and building a secure future for cats and dogs in the East Bay region.

Foster an Animal

East Bay SPCA foster care volunteers provide temporary care for puppies, dogs, kittens, and cats. Our foster animals are those who may need extra love, attention, training, or time. 

Dog Field Trips

Explore the Marina, hike the Oakland hills, or enjoy a café outing with a dog wearing an “Adopt Me” bandanna—you could be the bridge to helping them find a loving home.

Dog Sleepovers

Sleepovers offer shelter dogs a break from the shelter environment, promoting mental and physical well-being, while serving as a vital tool for better matching them with potential adopters.

## Become a Foster Parent

To become a foster parent, please complete our Foster Application and Foster Release form. Once your application is reviewed, we will send you a link to an online foster care orientation. As a foster, you’ll also have the opportunity to take our animals on field trips, giving them a break from the shelter while helping them gain exposure and socialization.

Puppies and kittens 

+

-

Puppies and kittens over 4 weeks old are no longer neonates, and are eating on their own! However they are not able to be placed up for adoption until they have reached a certain age and weight, and need a loving foster home to grow up in until that time. These adorable little friends are in the middle of a crucial socialization period, and our fosters have the opportunity to introduce them to all the things that will make them wonderful companions in their forever home.

Shy and fearful dogs 

+

-

These friends think shelter life is overwhelming! Many dogs come into our care “under-socialized,” meaning they haven’t had the benefit of various life experiences that most other dogs take for granted. New people, sounds, smells, or routines are all extra scary for them. Because of this, learning about trust often happens more quickly outside of the stress of the shelter environment! Our shy dog fosters work with our behavior department to set these dogs up for success, and help them blossom into confident, social, loving companions.

Big, active dogs 

+

-

Shelter populations are changing across the country, and big active dogs are our neediest population! The stress of the shelter has measurable effects on their brain function and mental health. Because of this, field trips, sleepovers, and longer-term foster stays away from the shelter are invaluable to helping them cope with the chronic stress which can occur over time. Many of these dogs are active and love hiking, jogging, and adventures, but many others are simply looking for a quiet place to decompress and recover from the effects of a prolonged shelter stay.

Animals needing extra nursing care 

+

-

These cases can vary greatly from animals not quite ready for adoption as they recover from minor illnesses like a cold to those recovering from physical injuries.

Hisses to Kisses program and feline behavioral support 

+

-

Shelter stress affects felines too! We may recommend foster for certain cats based on their behavior needs. Our “Hisses to Kisses” fosters receive special training and have socialized hundreds of “feral” kittens since the program’s inception. Under the guidance of our behavior team, fosters can help shelter cats overcome behavior challenges like overstimulation, fear, inappropriate litter box usage, intense play, and many more.

Neonate animals 

+

-

Orphaned neonate kittens and puppies, aged from birth to four weeks, are highly vulnerable and depend entirely on foster care for survival. They require around the clock bottle feeding and frequent monitoring to ensure their health and development. While it can be labor intensive, the rewarding feeling you’ll receive will be immeasurable.

Fostering a pet from East Bay SPCA not only gives them a temporary home filled with love but also creates space in the shelter for more animals in need. When you open your home to foster an animal, you become a vital member of a team dedicated to enriching the human-animal bond and building a secure future for cats and dogs in the East Bay region.
