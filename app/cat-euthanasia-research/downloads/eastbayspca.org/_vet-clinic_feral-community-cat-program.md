# Feral/Community Cat Program

The cities of San Leandro and Livermore have partnered with East Bay SPCA to better serve their residents.

**To help decrease the feral cat population, East Bay SPCA has limited Trap-Neuter-Return appointments for San Leandro residents at our Spay/Neuter Clinic.** **As of July 1, 2025 these appointments will also be available for Livermore residents.**

## **What is a Feral Cat?**

Feral cats are cats that have no homes and live in the wild. Feral cats are not social to people due to their limited interactions with humans. Typically, when approached by humans, feral cats will immediately flee or display defensive behaviors such as hissing and growling. 

## **What is Trap-Neuter-Return?**

Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) helps feral cats by stopping reproduction and stabilizing feral cat colony populations. Altering (spaying/neutering) reduces behaviors related to mating including yowling, spraying, pregnancy, fighting, and the birth of more cats.

  1. Trap: Cats are humanely trapped in a colony setting utilizing a cat trap.

  2. Neuter: The cats are transported in their traps to be neutered (or spayed), vaccinated, and ear tipped (a universal symbol indicating they have been altered) by a veterinarian.

  3. Return: The cats are released to the location in which they were trapped after they have recovered from surgery (typically within 24hrs) to continue to live in the wild.

## **Feral Cat Trapping Tips**

  * Ensure that only feral cats are being trapped. Many neighborhoods have both owned and stray tame cats roaming the streets. Ensure that only feral cats are being trapped for spay or neuter. Make sure that you are making the effort to find out about owned cats in the area: color, sex, and other identifying information. 

  * Do not trap ear-tipped, stray, or possibly owned pet or tame cats.
    * **Stray Cat:** Likely to approach you, may approach food right away that you put down, likely to vocalize, may look disheveled, may be seen at all hours of the day.

    * **Feral Cat:** Will not approach you, will wait until you leave before approaching food, appears well groomed, more active at night, and cannot be handled.

  * Check carefully for an ear tip; if you have trapped a cat that already has an ear tip, release the cat immediately if identified.

  * If you trap a sickly cat and plan to treat it, please complete treatment before surgery to maximize the cat’s health. This will entail a visit to a local veterinarian to assess a treatment plan. If you notice the cat is sick, you must treat the cat before bringing in for spay/neuter.

### **Important Information on Trapping:**

  1. Before you trap, establish a routine feeding schedule. Feed the cats the same time each day in that same place. Feed the cats on schedule for at least one week prior to trapping.

  2. Notify your neighbors that you are trapping area cats. Be aware of the difference between feral and stray cats. 

  3. Plan a safe place to house the trapped cat while it is waiting for the surgical appointment (no more than 12hrs). Plan safe transport of the cat to the surgical site.

  4. Set trap based on your feeding schedule no more than 12 hours prior to your scheduled appointment.

  5. Withhold food 8hrs prior to surgery. Continue to provide clean fresh water. Cover the trap with a sheet to calm the cat. Place cardboard or newspaper underneath to collect and absorb feces/urine.

## **Post- Surgery Aftercare**

  1. You may notice your cat doing some unusual behaviors such as head bobbing and weaving and over-reacting to noise and fast movements. These signs, as well as glassy eyes, are normal side effects of the anesthetic used. The cat may also be a little quiet but should return to normal the day following surgery.

  2. Your cat has no external stitches, so there is no need to return to the clinic for suture removal.

  3. In order to recover from the anesthesia and surgery, feral cats should be kept indoors or in a warm, dry sheltered overnight after discharge from the Spay/Neuter Clinic. Do not put your hand in the trap to give food and water. As long as they are fully- conscious, clear-eyed, alert and do not need further medical attention, they can be released.
