# The Perfect Pair: Pepper and Bean Sprout’s Bond

Feb 24, 2024 

Pepper (formerly Kipper) was the perfect match for my then-resident cat Bean Sprout. The staff at SPCA helped me find a kitty who was the perfect match — confident, savvy, curious, and eager to get to know his brother! After a long introduction process, they are both getting along really well — playing, cuddling, grooming, and loving each other’s company! 

Pepper is a really special guy and is so playful, energetic, and curious. He also loves a good cuddle and some lap time. He’s a perfect balance for my other cat! 

The East Bay SPCA staff were so incredible to work with, they helped me with everything during the adoption process and took such amazing care of Pepper until I was lucky enough to meet him. You can tell they all care so deeply about their animals!
