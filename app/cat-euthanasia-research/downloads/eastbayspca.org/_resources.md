# Resources

At East Bay SPCA, our Humane Advocacy Programs are here to support you and your pet. We specialize in providing a compassionate, comprehensive, and safe space for pet owners seeking assistance with their cats and dogs.

Our Humane Advocacy program is here to help pet owners in need of support. It isn’t intended for found cats or cats you’d like to surrender. If you’ve found a cat and want to bring it to a shelter, please [visit this page.](https://eastbayspca.org/resources/lost-found-stray-pets#found)

Serving the Pets & People in Our Community

We are **More Than a Shelter** , supporting the increasing and changing needs of animals and people in our community and beyond. We believe all people, regardless of their housing situation, income level, race, spoken language, or access to resources, should be able to experience the joys of the human-animal bond.
