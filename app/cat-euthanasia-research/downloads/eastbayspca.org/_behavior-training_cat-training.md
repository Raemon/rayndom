# Cat Training

Cat private training sessions are only available online via Zoom. Bringing cats to a new environment is often overwhelming for them and therefore not conducive to training.

You can train cats? The answer is yes! East Bay SPCA is proud to offer online Feline Private Training Sessions. In these sessions, one of our trainers will observe and work closely with you and your cat and make recommendations for training and management plans. Many cat owners don’t realize that there are a host of training and management options at their disposal which can help to improve common undesirable behaviors such as door darting, furniture scratching, rough play, and many more.

But private training isn’t just for problem solving — you can also learn to teach your cats fun tricks, cooperative care techniques for things like nail trimming and grooming, as well as enrichment activities such as harness training. The possibilities are endless!
