# Pet Care Financial Assistance

Our Humane Advocacy (HA) team helps make veterinary care more accessible through our [Theodore B. Travers Family Veterinary Clinic](https://eastbayspca.org/vet-clinic/veterinary-services). We’re here to advocate for you and your pet, guiding you through appointments, financial decisions, and connecting you with the resources you need. 

We offer **two types** of financial support: assistance for veterinary conditions (non–spay/neuter) and separate assistance for low-cost spay/neuter services. Please review the eligibility and process for each program below.
