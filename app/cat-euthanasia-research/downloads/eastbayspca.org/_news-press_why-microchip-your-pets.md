# Why Microchip Your Pets? Even indoor pets can go on unintended adventures, keep your furry family members accounted for.

February 20, 2025

## **Safety First: Microchipping Matters**

Even when we do our best to care for our animals, life can be unpredictable. Should your dog or cat ever get lost, an up-to-date microchip ensures you can be reached when they’re found. Lost and stray pets have their chips scanned on intake into our shelter, and unfortunately, we see animals with unregistered microchips every day.

Whether you’ve moved recently, gotten a new phone number, or just want to double-check your pet’s ID status, it’s always a good idea to **update your pet’s microchip registration** with a secure registry.

Keeping tabs on your dog or cat’s registration can help in other ways, too. In the rare event that a microchip company ceases operations, as recently happened with [one Texas organization](https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/microchip-company-closes-pet-owner-next-steps/), you’ll be able to act swiftly in your pet’s best interest.
