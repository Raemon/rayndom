# Feline Foundations: Cat Communication 101

## September 21, 2025 @ 11:00 am \- 12:30 pm

# What is your cat trying to tell YOU?

**Come gain insider knowledge from our cat body language experts!**

Even if you’ve had cats your whole life, you may not have learned to read the most subtle signals. One thing we always hear from new staff and volunteers: “I never knew there was so much MORE to cat body language!” Join our seminar for a comprehensive overview of that language from our certified trainers, and gain practical strategies to address behaviors like scratching, nipping, ankle chasing, house soiling, and more!
