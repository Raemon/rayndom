# Groundbreaking Canine Care

Nov 4, 2024 

Upon first glance, Artemis, Mango, and Brayden seemed to have little in common.

The three puppies were distinct—Artemis, the first to arrive at East Bay SPCA, was a 3-month-old German Shepherd mix. Mango, a tiny 10-week-old Terrier, came next. Last was Brayden, a 5-month-old Australian Cattle Dog mix.

But despite their differences, the three puppies shared something significant. All arrived suffering from Parvovirus.

Parvovirus poses the highest risk to puppies who have yet to complete their entire vaccine series, leaving them vulnerable.

The symptoms include fever, lethargy, loss of appetite, and gastrointestinal issues. Without treatment, the disease can be devastating and often fatal, especially for young puppies with underdeveloped immune systems.

Soon after arriving at East Bay SPCA, all three were confirmed to have the disease. Our medical staff moved swiftly to provide supportive care to them. They were given anti-nausea medication, fluids, and feeding support to keep their strength up. Medical staff monitored the puppies closely and kept them separated from other shelter animals to prevent the spread of the virus.

The puppies shared something else in common – all were given a breakthrough treatment called the Canine Parvovirus Monoclonal Antibody (CPMA). The first and only proven treatment for Parvovirus, CPMA reduces the duration and intensity of Parvovirus symptoms and drastically improves the likelihood of survival for dogs and puppies affected with the disease.

“Thanks to the groundbreaking CPMA treatment, these puppies saw a swift improvement in their symptoms, reflecting our commitment to using medical advances for better outcomes,”

— Kristen Beitzel, VP of Medical Services

East Bay SPCA was fortunate enough to receive the antibody treatment soon after it was released. All three puppies were given this brand-new treatment, and within just days, they started to improve. They began to eat on their own again and their bright, happy personalities returned.

Due to the excellent care provided by our medical team and the innovative new treatment the puppies received, all three survived and found loving homes. We are excited to be one of the first shelters to offer this groundbreaking treatment that will save the lives of so many dogs and puppies across the country.
