# Canine Academy [Dublin]

## June 23, 2025 \- June 27, 2025

**Grade Range: entering 7th-9th grade**

Make a difference in the lives of shelter dogs by providing valuable training to help them find their fur-ever homes! This session focuses on teaching campers the skills of animal behavior and training, through games, activities, and animal interactions. Campers will put these new skills to the test when they are grouped with a shelter dog, helping the dogs to build manners and confidence, and helping our campers to build life-long memories. Don’t worry, Canine Academy has plenty of cat time too!
