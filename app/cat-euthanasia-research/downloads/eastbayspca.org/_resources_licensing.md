# Licensing

Please contact your local public agency for current license pricing. Discounts may be available for seniors and/or low-income households. Most agencies also offer a discounted rate for spayed/neutered pets.

You may wish to inquire about obtaining a 2 or 3 year license, depending on your dog’s current rabies vaccination expiration date. For additional information, please follow the links below to their websites or call them directly.
