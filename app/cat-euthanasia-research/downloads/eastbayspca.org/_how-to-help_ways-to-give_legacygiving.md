Taking the time to create a living trust, will or other legal document now can provide you with the peace of mind that your plans have been formalized and will be carried out according to your wishes and specific instructions.

Charitable Remainder Trusts (CRT)

A trust that provides income to the donor or other beneficiaries for a set period, with the remainder going to the nonprofit.

Charitable Lead Trusts (CLT)

A trust where the nonprofit receives income for a specified term, and the remaining assets go to the donor’s heirs or other beneficiaries.

Retirement Plan Beneficiary Designations

Naming the nonprofit as a beneficiary of an IRA, 401(k), or other retirement accounts. These are often tax-efficient gifts.

Life Insurance

Donors can name the nonprofit as a beneficiary of their life insurance policy, or they may transfer ownership of an existing policy to the nonprofit.

Real Estate Gifts

Donating property outright or through a bequest. Some nonprofits also accept “retained life estates,” where donors gift property but retain the right to live there for life
