# From Shy to Settled: Kaiba’s Journey Home

Sep 10, 2025 

We adopted Kaiba from the Dublin ESPCA about a little while ago as a companion for our resident cat, Tuba. While they are still in the introduction phase, they have done well with each other, and we are hopeful they are well on the path to peaceful coexistence.

When in the shelter, Kaiba was very shut down and wouldn’t even come out to meet us before we adopted him. Once he arrived home, he remained skittish and found a new hideout under the bed. Although he would headbutt our hands to be pet, Kaiba would flinch and run away at any noise or sudden touch. Now, he’s almost a totally different cat! While he still remains cautious, Kaiba has taken to his new home nicely and does not hesitate to speak his mind.

East Bay SPCA staff were wonderful in guiding is through the adoption process and helping us decide if Kaiba was a good fit.

## Kaiba, feeling relaxed & right at home!
