# In Loving Memory: Volunteer Rich Velles Honors His Wife Through Service 

January 17, 2026

Every Monday morning at our Oakland Adoption Center, you’ll find Rich Velles quietly tending to the dogs — feeding, cleaning, giving potty breaks, and offering gentle companionship. But behind each of his kind, steady actions is a story of deep love, loss, and healing.

Rich first learned of East Bay SPCA in 2020 through PetFinder when he and his wife, Ashley, saw a photo of a little pitbull puppy. They came down to meet him in person — and just like that, Frankie became part of their family. Already proud pet parents to two boxers, the couple happily welcomed the new “little brother” Frankie into their home.

Ashley had always been passionate about dogs. In 2022, she followed that passion and opened a doggy daycare and boarding business, lovingly named **The Crate Escape**. Frankie, ever the social butterfly, was the Crate Escape’s “first staff member,” helping new dogs to feel at home. Their family continued to grow when they welcomed in a pitbull named Mocha, a sweet pup whose original owner could no longer care for her.

In October 2023, Rich and Ashley were dealt a devastating blow — Ashley was diagnosed with a terminal illness. She passed away less than two months later.

In the wake of profound grief, Rich turned to the place where Frankie first came into their lives — East Bay SPCA. Just one month after her passing, he filled out a volunteer application and began helping with the dogs every Monday morning.

“**Being around animals reminds me of a simpler time,** ” Rich shared. “**This has been a big part of the healing process, being around and socializing with the animals…it just keeps me close to her.** ”

In addition to his regular canine care duties, Rich completed training to become a **Canine Companion & Enrichment** volunteer — working one-on-one with dogs to help them build confidence and feel more at ease during their stay with us. Each Sunday night, he checks our website to see who’s been adopted and which pups he’ll get to see the next morning.

Rich dedicates every moment of his volunteer work to Ashley’s memory. “**Ashley turned me onto animals,** ” he says. And it’s clear that love continues to ripple outward through every pup he helps care for.

Rich still shares his home with a lively group of animal companions, including Frankie, Mocha, a three-year-old tabby named Jaida, and most recently, a special needs orange tabby kitten he adopted from us named Chicken.

We’re incredibly grateful to have Rich as part of our East Bay SPCA family. His quiet dedication, compassion, and heartfelt tribute to Ashley bring comfort, hope, and healing — not just to himself, but to the animals and people around him.

## _Thank you, Rich._
