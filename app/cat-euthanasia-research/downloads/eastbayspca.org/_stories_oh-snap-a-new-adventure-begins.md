# Oh Snap! A New Adventure Begins

Sep 30, 2025 

We adopted Missy, a 2-year-old dilute torti, from the Oakland East Bay SPCA last year, and she is the sweetest cat ever. She joined our family and easily transitioned with our cat Pippa. Everyone at East Bay SPCA is so friendly and helpful and really cares about each animal at the shelter. With so many cats and kittens in need of forever homes, we decided to adopt again. When I came to the Oakland shelter, I was amazed at how many kittens were there waiting, and fortunately lots of people were looking. I fell in love at first sight with Ginnie, a 9 week dilute torti tabby in a litter of three rambunctious girls. We now call her Snap, and she is just delightful and fun. She is not intimidated by Pippa and Missy, who weren’t thrilled about a new family member, and we’ve had hissing and growling but no real aggression. We did a very slow introduction process for the new and existing cats, and things have gone smoothly. What I really like about SPCA is that every cat is spayed/neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, and vet checked. The staff are always available for support and questions. The shelter is a special place, thanks to everyone who works and volunteers there. I hope that every animal finds a loving home.

Snap is so cute and playful. She loves to cuddle, purr, and get pets. Once we let her out of our study to be with Pippa and Missy in the bigger house, she was zipping all over, looking for any opportunity to play. She is learning boundaries from our two cats, and we are so happy to have her.

I knew I wanted to bring Snap home, and because I was a previous adopter and already in the system, the process went quickly, which I really appreciated. So did Snap!
