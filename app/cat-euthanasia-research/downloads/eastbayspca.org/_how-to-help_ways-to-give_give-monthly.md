# Give Monthly

When you join us as a monthly donor, you become a Constant Companion, helping us save lives all year long. By supporting the vital work of East Bay SPCA with a monthly commitment, you are giving animals the bright and loving future they deserve. 

When you donate $84/month, you become a member of our Circle of Friends: a community of donors committed to saving the lives of animals in innovative ways. Circle of Friends donors receive exclusive, behind-the-scenes invitations to meet our animals, learn about animal welfare, and connect with other animal advocates.
