# Calico Crew – Reptile Roundup [Dublin]

## October 11, 2025 @ 10:00 am \- 11:30 am

Our updated Shelter Scouts youth program, Calico Crew allows 8-11 year olds to explore animal care through games, crafts, and supervised meet-and-greets with shelter animals. Participants can join one or multiple modules. Each module will include safe, supervised, hands-on animal interaction.

**Reptile Roundup**

While cats and dogs are great, there are other fascinating creatures out there! Participants will learn what sets reptiles apart from our furry friends, create some amphibian artwork, and interact with a scaly sidekick.
