# Foster Profile: Kitten Whisperer Jaime Gabriel

November 26, 2025

Each year during Kitten Season (roughly April-October) our foster program places hundreds of kittens a month into temporary homes. Out of the 1,088 dogs and cats we placed through our foster program in 2023, more than 600 were neonate kittens (birth to four weeks old).

From round-the-clock bottle feeding and support for kittens postsurgery, to care for full litters of young cats, our foster volunteers are integral to the health and wellness of our feline population. It’s because of fosters like Jaime Gabriel that we’re able to offer support to municipal shelters, and place so many cats into homes each year.

Jaime is newer to our foster team, but not new to fostering. She began fostering 20 years ago with a local feline rescue, joining East Bay SPCA as a kitten foster earlier this year. Jaime provides shelter, companionship, and plenty of love “Foster Win” Miles Davis and affection for cats too young to be listed for adoption.

“I have space and the time and want to help however I can,” says Jaime. Earlier this year, a foster kitten named McRib found a special place in her heart – and ended up staying for good. “My dog and I fell in love, and now he’s Miles Davis, and part of our family,” she says, calling him a “foster win.”

Jaime recognizes that it can be challenging to develop a bond with an animal who will eventually need to leave the nest. Even though it’s difficult to say goodbye, she says it’s worth it in the end. “I like feeling like I’m making a difference, at least short term, in these kittens’ lives. Giving them love and attention they’ve maybe never had before, and setting them up for success in finding their forever home.”

Each year our need for more foster volunteers increases, as shelters like ours experience increased intake and overcrowding. There are a number of ways to get involved, and our flexible program works with your schedule.
