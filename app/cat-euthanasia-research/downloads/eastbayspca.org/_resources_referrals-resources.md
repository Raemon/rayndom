TNVR

Trap-Neuter-Vaccinate-Release (TNVR) programs aim to control the reproduction of community cats, ultimately reducing their population. This humane and effective method involves the trapping, spaying or neutering, and vaccination against rabies of community cats. Through TNVR, we strive to manage cat colonies responsibly, promoting both community welfare and the humane treatment of animals. Please use the resources below to learn more.
