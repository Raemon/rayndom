# Ways to Give

Your support of East Bay SPCA directly impacts the thousands of dogs and cats that come through our doors each year, right here in our community. During their stay at our shelter, animals receive expert medical care, behavior training, loving attention and opportunities for play and socialization. It takes a community of volunteers, fosters, and donors to do this!

Donating stocks allows you to avoid capital gains tax and often take a charitable deduction for the full value of the asset. Use this tool to donate stock so we can track your gift, send you the correct receipt, and ensure you can get the tax savings you deserve.

Donor-Advised Funds (DAFs) are investment accounts for the sole purpose of supporting charitable organizations today. This tool linked above automatically links with your DAF, allows you to recommend how you’d like your gift to be used and notifies East Bay SPCA of your intentions.
