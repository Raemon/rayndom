# A Year Apart-How a Microchip Brought Snowy Home

April 3, 2025

On the heels of World Stray Animals Day, we were honored to witness a beautiful reunion between a person and their pet. This moment highlights the significant role that community support, responsible pet ownership, and microchipping play in reducing the number of stray animals in our world. 

Linda signing in for her redemption of Snowy, just before their reunion.

As animal lovers, it’s heart-wrenching to imagine your furry family member going missing—especially after taking all the typical precautions to ensure their safety. Linda’s dog, Snowy, had a microchip, but the curious canine ran into some tough luck. After escaping from her fenced yard more than once, she wound up missing for a whole year.

Perhaps it was a strong determination to return home that inspired Snowy to take one more chance at escape. Thankfully, that adventurous spirit led the dog straight to our doorstep.

When an animal arrives at our campus, our intake process ensures their well-being and increases the chances of a successful reunion. First, we check for a microchip. In Snowy’s case, we discovered that her owner, Linda, had microchipped Snowy, making a reunion possible. Next, we conduct both behavioral and medical evaluations. Medically, she was in good health, but to ensure her continued well-being and the safety of all animals in our care, we administered all necessary vaccines.

With her brand new squeaky whale toy picked out, Snowy was ready to go home.

The reunion was a joyful moment for both as they greeted each other with a big hug and a wagging tail. Linda shared that her two daughters were waiting at home, unaware that they were about to welcome their sweet pooch back. We can only imagine the ecstatic reunion awaiting this 9-year-old dog!

Before they left, we offered Snowy a toy. Sure enough, she happily selected a large squeaky whale from our collection—clearly ready to take it and head home.

This heartwarming day was made possible by a microchip. That tiny yet powerful tool ensured Snowy was identified as a beloved pet. While all animals in our care receive the same high level of attention and compassion, reuniting them with their rightful families is invaluable.

## Reunited at last!
