# Keeping Holidays Joyful for Pets 

December 10, 2025

## Let’s keep our furry friends safe and healthy through New Year’s 

Planning to travel or host holiday events this season? While the end of the year can be fun and exciting for us, sometimes festivities and disruptions to routines can be challenging for our furry loved ones. 

**Prepare to keep your pets healthy and stress-free this holiday season by considering the following:**

  * **Festive Food:** The holidays are a time for indulgences, but it’s important to keep our pets from getting anything that might cause them digestive distress. Chocolate and candy are toxic to dogs, so keep them well out of reach. When it comes to rich food, skip giving your pet their own portion. Opt for a snack of baked sweet potato or unseasoned turkey instead!



  * **Holiday Boarding:** If you plan on traveling and boarding your pet, visit a vet first to confirm they are up to date on vaccinations and preventatives like flea, tick and heartworm medication, as well as prepped with any behavioral medication they might need.



  * **Thoughtful Decor:** Mistletoe and poinsettias are beautiful winter additions to the home, but should never be ingested by animals. Keep pets well away from these plants, and string wires and lights thoughtfully, knowing that they might entice animals who don’t know about the risk of shock.



  * **Preventing Stress:** For pets that may be anxious during busy holiday events (New Year’s Eve fireworks can be tough on cats and dogs alike) ensure they have a safe, quiet place to relax. Employ a white noise machine, their favorite toys and bedding, and if your pet benefits from anxiety medication, make a [veterinary appointment](https://eastbayspca.org/vet-clinic/veterinary-services) ahead of time to renew their prescription.

  * **Activities & Play**: You can make sure your pets get in the joyful spirit by providing enrichment! Great for brain stimulation, exercise, and entertainment; enrichment activities can also keep your pets distracted and stress-free amidst the hustle and bustle of the season. We have plenty of [creative ways to keep dogs occupied](https://eastbayspca.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Canine-Enrichment-Handout.pdf), and [tips for entertaining cats](https://eastbayspca.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Feline-Enrichment-Guide.pdf), too!
