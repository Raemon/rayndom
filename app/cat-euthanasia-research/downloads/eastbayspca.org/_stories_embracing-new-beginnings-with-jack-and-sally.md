# New Beginnings with Jack and Sally

Nov 2, 2023 

The loss of our beloved dog Max in May 2023 left a profound void in our lives, but the blessing of finding Jack and Sally at the Dublin SPCA helped mend our hearts. From the moment we laid eyes on these two adorable puppies, my wife and I knew they were meant to be part of our family. The joy they bring to our lives is immeasurable, and their presence has been a source of comfort and healing.

Witnessing Jack and Sally grow and learn new things has been a remarkable journey. Their boundless energy, curiosity, and affection have filled our home with warmth and laughter. Each day, as we share in their milestones and unique personalities, we are reminded of the incredible capacity for love that animals can offer. We are grateful for the Dublin SPCA for bringing Jack and Sally into our lives, and we look forward to the many more cherished moments we’ll create together.
