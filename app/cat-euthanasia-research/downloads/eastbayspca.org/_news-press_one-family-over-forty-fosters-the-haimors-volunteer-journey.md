# One Family, Over Forty Fosters: The Haimor’s Volunteer Journey

July 11, 2025

### For nearly a year and a half, the Haimor family — Fawzi, Houda, and their daughter Layla — have been dedicated volunteers at East Bay SPCA.

Every Friday, they can be found at the shelter, serving as Canine Companions and offering love and socialization to dogs in need. Their journey into animal welfare was sparked by Layla, an 11-year-old with a deep passion for animals.

Layla’s love for animals began early, and her enthusiasm quickly spread throughout the family. Initially, the Haimors supported the East Bay SPCA by fostering animals, providing temporary homes for dogs and cats in need. Over the years, they have fostered more than 40 animals, ensuring each one received care, affection, and preparation for a forever home. Their fostering experience naturally led them to become onsite volunteers, where they now work hands-on with the animals at the shelter.

A particularly inspiring aspect of the Haimor family’s story is their commitment to service despite their busy lives. With four children in the household, Houda homeschools them and encourages each child to explore their individual passions. For Layla, this has meant deepening her involvement in animal care. Her maturity and eloquence belie her age, and she has become an advocate for shelter animals, inspiring those around her to consider volunteering or fostering. 

Fawzi and Houda support their daughter’s dreams wholeheartedly, and their Friday volunteering sessions have become a cherished family tradition. Beyond walking and playing with the dogs, they help socialize and train them in basic commands, making them more likely to be adopted. Their compassionate efforts align perfectly with East Bay SPCA’s mission, demonstrating how families can make a meaningful impact in their community.

The Haimors’ journey underscores the power of family, kindness, and dedication to a cause greater than ourselves. By fostering, volunteering, and advocating for animals in need, they have set a powerful example — not just for their own children, but for anyone looking to make a difference. Thanks to their efforts, many dogs and cats have found loving homes, and Layla is well on her way to turning her passion into a lifelong career in veterinary medicine.

East Bay SPCA is Fawzi and Houda’s special Layla activity. When they first fostered animals, Layla said it was hard to give them up. Now she understands the powerful difference they are making in their lives and the humans whose lives they enrich. Layla sees herself as sending dogs and cats to loving homes where they will be cherished. Layla admits to having some favorites, though, and has been extra excited to see those dogs and cats find a home. She continues to refine her skills in dog and cat training, demonstrating her expertise with the shelter animals. She also spends time outside East Bay SPCA working with and riding horses. The family loves volunteering and sees it as a privilege rather than an obligation. They look forward to many more years at East Bay SPCA.
