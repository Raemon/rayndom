# Look At That! Workshop with Cory Abshear

## October 26, 2025 @ 5:00 pm \- 6:30 pm

Looking to build a solid tool in your reactivity toolbox?

This is an in-person group class focused on learning the Look at That (LAT) pattern game developed by the founder of Control Unleashed, Leslie McDevitt MA CDBC. It is designed to help dogs who have “big feelings” about environmental triggers. These feelings may present as barking, lunging, growling, freezing, fleeing, etc.

LAT helps to teach our dogs that these triggers can actually predict good things. While paying careful attention to your dog’s body language to ensure that they remain comfortable (“below threshold”), we approach training in a way that ensures joyful participation between you and your pup.

To apply for a spot, use the link provided at the bottom left to sign up through Dog Trek’s website!

This course if perfect for people that want to strengthen their communication and bond with their pup while taking a deeper dive into the how and why of modern positive reinforcement training methods. You will learn more about how to add more choice and help your dog feel more confident around potential triggers. As this is a group class, dogs that have a hard time being around other people or pups might have a hard time, but accommodations can be made! If you think your pup will not be able to handle the group setting, I encourage you to check out an auditor spot.

NOTE: This is a guest spot: this workshop will be hosted by a local certified trainer and not directly by East Bay SPCA staff
