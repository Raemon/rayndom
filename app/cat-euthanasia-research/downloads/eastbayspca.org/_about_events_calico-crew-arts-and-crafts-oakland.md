# Calico Crew – Arts and Crafts [Oakland]

## September 28, 2025 @ 10:00 am \- 11:30 am

Our updated Shelter Scouts youth program, Calico Crew allows 8-11 year olds to explore animal care through games, crafts, and supervised meet-and-greets with shelter animals. Participants can join one or multiple modules. Each module will include safe, supervised, hands-on animal interaction.

**Arts and Crafts**

This module is for animal lovers who also love arts and crafts! Channel your creativity into animal-themed crafts to take home and help lower shelter animal stress by making beneficial enrichment items and adoption ads.
