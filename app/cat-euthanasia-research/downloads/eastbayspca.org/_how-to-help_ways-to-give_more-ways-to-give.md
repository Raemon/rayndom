## Employer Matching

Many employers sponsor matching gift programs to match their employees’ charitable contributions. Gifts from employees’ spouses and retirees may also qualify for a match. Search to find out if your employer has a matching gift program. It’s a quick and easy way to double your contribution. Regular contributions can make a big impact over time, providing dogs and cats with refuge, medical care, and a second chance.

What is a matching gift? 

+

-

Employee matching gift programs are corporate giving programs.

Here’s an example. Let’s say you work for General Electric and donate $100 to the East Bay SPCA. General Electric’s matching gift policy has a minimum gift requirement of $25 and matches at a 1:1 ratio. After you submit your matching gift form, GE will double your donation by also writing a check for $100.

Check whether your company will match a gift by using the search tool above and find everything you need to apply.

How do I request a matching gift? 

+

-

Requesting a matching gift is normally a five-minute process initiated by the donor. You can do this by filling out and submitting a paper form provided by your employer or through an electronic submission process.

There are typically 3 steps:

## Donate

Make your personal donation and save your tax receipt. Many matching programs will accept paperwork to request a corporate match up to one year after an employee has donated.

## Search

Search using the tool above to find out whether your company offers a matching gift program and review the guidelines. No results? Contact your HR department directly to ask if they offer a matching gift program.

## Match

There are two common ways to submit the matching gift request:  
Click on your company’s intranet link provided in the search results. Log-in and submit your request electronically.

Download your company’s matching gift verification form using the link provided in the search results. Print it, fill it out and send it to us. We will take care of the rest.

I made a donation a few months ago. Can I still apply for a matching gift? 

+

-

Yes—it’s not too late to apply for a matching gift. Many companies allow employees to submit match requests for one year following the date of the donation.

What are volunteer grant programs? 

+

-

Volunteer grant programs (also referred to as volunteer matching programs or Dollars for Doer’s) are corporate giving programs in which companies provide monetary donations to organizations where employees volunteer regularly.

For example: If you volunteered your time as a Walk Team Captain to help raise awareness about kidney disease in your community and fundraised for the Kidney Walk, your employer may donate cash for your volunteer time.

Each company has specific guidelines for their volunteer grant programs — search here to see if your company offers this benefit and find everything you need to submit your volunteer time. You can always contact your company’s HR department for more information.

If you volunteer with us, it’s an easy way to provide us with additional financial support.
