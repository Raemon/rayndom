## Converging Challenges

We are at a time of convergence of crises across animal care and community.

We are at a moment when we must take action together to evolve and build sustainable support for people and companion animals.

**The Population Gap**|   
---|---  
In 2020, 2% more animals left shelters than came into them. In 2021, the gap flipped to 2% more coming in than leaving. In 2023, we stand at 5% more coming in than leaving. This is leading shelters to experience higher populations and longer stays for animals.  
  
The stray intake rate for dogs has increased significantly. January-May 2023 showed a 10% increase compared to 2022 and a rise of 30% compared to 2021.  
_-Shelter Animals Count_|   
  
**Instability & Inequity**  
---  
“People who did part with their pets often cited a housing change, typically to a residence that did not allow pets or a job change that left them unable to properly care for the animal.”  
  
“The animal adoption crisis is less about unwanted pandemic pets, animal advocates say, and more about the post-pandemic economy and societal shifts.” _-The Hill_  
  
The Alameda County Food Bank reports that one in four residents of Alameda County struggles to put food on the table.  
  
**Staffing Shortage**  
---  
Over 130,000 veterinary technicians and over 40,000 veterinarians are needed by 2030 within private veterinary practices; this isn’t including the need among animal shelters & rescues, and needs of other groups caring for animals. _-MARS Veterinary Health_  
  
Sixty-nine percent of animal shelters report their own lack of access to care for animals in preparation for adoption is negatively impacting their organizations. _-The Association for Animal Welfare Advancement_  
  
**Spay/Neuter Decline**  
---  
According to a study published in _Frontiers of Veterinary Science_ , there is an estimated deficit of more than 2.7 million spay-neuter surgeries that animal welfare organizations have yet to address due to reduced spay/neuter during the COVID lockdown.
