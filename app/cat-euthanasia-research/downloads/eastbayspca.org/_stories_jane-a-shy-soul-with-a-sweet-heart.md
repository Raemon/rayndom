# Jane: A Shy Soul with a Sweet Heart

Jun 25, 2025 

I came to see Jane 9 years ago after my female bull terrier died suddenly. We brought Buster, my male bull terrier as we needed his blessing to adopt a companion for him. Jane was named G.I. Jane at the shelter as she preferred to crawl and was extremely shy and shut down. I think she had been at the shelter for over 6 months. Buster loved her and I knew that with the help of my trainer, we could make progress with her and give her a good, loving home.

It took 2 years of hard work and socialization with my trainer for Jane to really come out of her shell. She loved and trusted me and my trainer almost immediately. She was afraid of strangers. I remember the day that I had a visitor to my home and she walked up to him, and looked him in the eye to say hello. It was such a wonderful milestone. She has always been the kindest, sweetest dog. Now she loves and trusts people. She’s everyone’s favorite. Words cannot describe how special this dog is.

I want to acknowledge your volunteer Marti, as she had worked with Jane and knew that she was special. She loved her and spent time with me as I was getting to know Jane. She has been in contact with me all these years and genuinely cares about all of the dogs she volunteers with. She is such a gem.
