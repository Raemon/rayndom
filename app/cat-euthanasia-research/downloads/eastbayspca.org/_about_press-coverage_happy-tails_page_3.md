##  [ New Beginnings with Jack and Sally ](https://eastbayspca.org/stories/embracing-new-beginnings-with-jack-and-sally)

Nov 2, 2023 

"Our new pet has already brought so much joy, especially during Halloween when we dressed them up in adorable costumes—a delightful experience. The staff at East Bay SPCA, particularly in Dublin, played a crucial role in making this match possible. Their assistance was not only helpful but also marked by kindness, making the entire process a positive and memorable experience." - Mike, Adopter

##  [ Festive Fun with Ms. Mojave ](https://eastbayspca.org/stories/festive-fun-with-ms-mojave)

Oct 29, 2023 

"The story of our new kitty cat, Ms. Mojave, is truly one to cherish. We welcomed her into our family when she was just four months old, and now, at five months, she's experiencing her first Christmas, Thanksgiving, and Halloween with us. She has become a delightful addition to our household, bringing joy and laughter into our daily lives. Receiving her as an early Christmas present has made this holiday season even more memorable and heartwarming." - La Shawn, Adopter

##  [ Teddy Bear Enjoys a Wonderful Retirement ](https://eastbayspca.org/stories/teddy-bear-enjoys-a-wonderful-retirement)

Oct 23, 2023 

"Teddy is the complete package…occasionally crazy with the zoomies, energetic for about 5 minutes of the day but otherwise mostly lazy, hopelessly in love with Costco's rotisserie chicken and prosciutto, loves people and belly rubs, will happily lay at your feet while you're hard at work, and he very much still gets a kick out of occasionally chasing the neighborhood cats (which we have always discouraged) even in his golden years!" - Irene, Adopter

##  [ Volunteer Falls in Love with Dog & Adopts ](https://eastbayspca.org/stories/in-libero-ac-augue-dolor-mattis)

Sep 25, 2023 

"Mr. Chicken Wiggles has kept his name, with all of the positive associations he has with it. We look forward to East Bay SPCA training classes so he can gently learn to be positively effective at whatever job he has set out to do. He loves his doggie pool and water! He has made friends with the doggies in the neighboring backyards and can play ball forever. We are enjoying every minute of being together and falling more and more in love with this divinely majestic beast." - Brenda, adopter

##  [ Mushroom the Cat Finds his Home ](https://eastbayspca.org/stories/mushroom-the-cat-finds-his-home)

Sep 22, 2023 

"Mushroom has been such a fantastic companion and baby for our household. He adjusted quickly when we brought him home for the first time. He loves playing, cuddling, and exploring different nooks and corners of our apartment. He loves to climb his cat tower and neighbor watch. He loves taking long naps, either on his tower or our couch. He is a very social, calm, and curious cat. We love him so much and are so happy that he's part of our family!" - Danica, Adopter

##  [ Goose is Thriving a Year after Adoption ](https://eastbayspca.org/stories/consetetur-sadipscing-elitr-diam-nonumy)

Sep 20, 2023 

"Goose is a big, loving fluff ball. He warms up quickly to people and is just the sweetest ball of love. I am so lucky to have him in my life. He is incredibly loved and very spoiled!" - Felicia, Goose's adopter 

##  [ Billie Finds New Lease on Life ](https://eastbayspca.org/stories/lorem-ipsum-dolor-sit-amet-consetetur-sadipscing-elitr-sed-diam-nonumy-eirmod)

Sep 18, 2023 

"Billie has grown so much. She loves people, loves going outside, and thrives off of routine. Watching her learn to play with my small senior chi-weenie was one of my favorite things. She's so goofy and loves laying out in the sun outside on her cot. We are so lucky that she became part of our family. She is such a good girl. I'm so proud of how far she has come, and I know the loving staff at East Bay SPCA would be too." -Claire, Adopter
