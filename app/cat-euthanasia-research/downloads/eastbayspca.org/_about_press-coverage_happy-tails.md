##  [ Oh Snap! A New Adventure Begins ](https://eastbayspca.org/stories/oh-snap-a-new-adventure-begins)

Sep 30, 2025 

And Snap makes 3! Their adopter writes: "I fell in love at first sight with Ginnie, a 9 week dilute torti tabby in a litter of three rambunctious girls. We now call her Snap, and she is just delightful and fun."

##  [ From Shy to Settled: Kaiba’s Journey Home ](https://eastbayspca.org/stories/from-shy-to-settled-kaibas-journey-home)

Sep 10, 2025 

From shy to snuggly, how Kaiba has taken to his new home and is starting to warm up to his kitty housemate.

##  [ Pita Pocket’s Leap into Love ](https://eastbayspca.org/stories/pita-pockets-leap-into-love)

Sep 3, 2025 

She’s been in my home for a year, but it feels like she always lived here. She fits in perfectly; she is a super cat! Sometimes I just look at her and still cannot believe that this beautiful wonder cat is mine.

##  [ Flash’s Story: The Best ‘Never’ We Ever Said Yes To ](https://eastbayspca.org/stories/flashs-story-the-best-never-we-ever-said-yes-to)

Aug 16, 2025 

We adopted Flash (formerly known as Wyclef) in July of 2017, so coming up on 8 years with him this month! He was around 4 or 5 years old at the time and the sweetest little guy. My mom swore up and down that the only breed she would never adopt was a chihuahua...

##  [ From Shy to Shine: Alfie & Owen’s Perfect Match ](https://eastbayspca.org/stories/from-shy-to-shine-alfie-owens-perfect-match)

Aug 5, 2025 

It all started I saw a picture of Alfie (formerly "Redvine") on East Bay ESPA's website. He had such a sweet face! He'd been in the Dublin shelter for several months - he was extremely shy - and I just knew that my quiet household would be a good place for him.

##  [ Sunshine, Dog Parks, Tofu, and Healing ](https://eastbayspca.org/stories/sunshine-dog-parks-tofu-and-healing)

Jul 25, 2025 

We weren’t sure we were ready for a new pup, but I knew SPCA wouldn’t be a bad place to stop by. Since it did give us our Lally girl. All the signs pointed to Agave once we walked into the kennels.

##  [ Chosen by Phoebe ](https://eastbayspca.org/stories/chosen-by-phoebe)

Jul 1, 2025 

My cat of 16 years passed away, and our family was having a hard time. My boys, who haven't known a day without a cat, were very upset and wanted to check out the cats at the shelter. So when adoption day came, I surprised them with a visit, and they fell in love with Phoebe.

##  [ Jane: A Shy Soul with a Sweet Heart ](https://eastbayspca.org/stories/jane-a-shy-soul-with-a-sweet-heart)

Jun 25, 2025 

I came to see Jane 9 years ago after my female bull terrier died suddenly. We brought Buster, my male bull terrier as we needed his blessing to adopt a companion for him. Jane was named G.I. Jane at the shelter as she preferred to crawl and was extremely shy and shut down. 

##  [ From Baby to Buddy: Senior Souls, Endless Love ](https://eastbayspca.org/stories/from-baby-to-buddy-senior-souls-endless-love)

Jun 7, 2025 

Buddy immediately stood out to us- an almost 8 year old senior GSD male who just wanted to be loved. We began our journey by fostering him, very quickly realizing he was exactly what we needed.

##  [ Nyx, Bringer of Affection and Ankle Attacks ](https://eastbayspca.org/stories/nyx-bringer-of-affection-and-ankle-attacks)

Apr 1, 2025 

Nyx is sharp, both figuratively and literally. It doesn't take her very long to improvise her way around any barrier. Especially if that barrier is between her and food.
