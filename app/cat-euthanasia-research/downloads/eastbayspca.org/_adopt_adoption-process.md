# Adoption Process

We love bringing humans and animals together—so our staff is here to help you every step of the way. 

## Finding A Pet

Start by [browsing our adoption listing](https://eastbayspca.org/adopt) to see our adoptable dogs and cats. Our website is updated every few minutes, so it’s the best way to know if an animal is still available. Discover our [special adoption programs](https://eastbayspca.org/adopt) catering to seniors, military veterans, animals with medical needs, and bonded pairs—making it easier and more rewarding to find the perfect companion for your unique lifestyle.

You’re welcome to walk in [during our open hours](https://eastbayspca.org/about/locations-and-hours) to meet animals in person. We ask that you meet 1-2 dogs or cats per visit. 

You are welcome to bring your current dog to your dog/puppy adoption meeting. Our team will be available to help introduce the dogs (for some dogs, this is required).

Adoption Holds 

+

-

  * We operate on a first-come, first-served basis.
  * We do not take holds by phone or email.
  * If the pet still requires spay or neuter surgery, we may place a short-term adoption hold only after a member of the household has visited the animal in person. The cost for this hold is $25 or $50. If a hold results in an adoption, the $25.00 hold fee ($50 for puppies and kittens) will be applied to the adoption fee.
  * If the hold does not result in adoption, the hold fee is non-refundable.
  * We do not have waitlists for animals on hold, and we do not contact interested parties if a hold is released and an animal becomes available again. Check our adoption list frequently for updates, as it may be updated several times a day.
