# Pita Pocket’s Leap into Love

Sep 3, 2025 

It was in July that I adopted Pita Pocket kitty from your Oakland campus. This timid, quiet kitty was in your care for an extended time and, due to stress, suffered anorexia. She has now blossomed into a super sweet, affectionate, well-adjusted, curious, busy cat. She is a constant source of amusement. At times, she goes from total love bug, soliciting chin scratches and wanting to cuddle, to agile furry gymnast, leaping through the air with effortless grace, performing aerial maneuvers with ease, always ready for another game of chase.

She’s been in my home for a year, but it feels like she always lived here. She fits in perfectly; she is a super cat! Sometimes I just look at her and still cannot believe that this beautiful wonder cat is mine. This adoption was special; I will always remember every detail. Thank you.
