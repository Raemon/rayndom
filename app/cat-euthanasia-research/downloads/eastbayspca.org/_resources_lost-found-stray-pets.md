## I Found An Animal

If you find a stray or lost pet, immediately contact your local Animal Control agency in order to give the pet the best chance of being reunited with its owner. If you have any concerns about abuse or neglect based on the pet’s condition when you found them, please discuss these concerns with your local Animal Control. You can take these steps to help:

* 1\. Exotic Pets & Wildlife Resources

You may be asked by your local Animal Control agency to temporarily keep the pet in your home if you are able to care for them while they try to find the pet’s owner. They will handle the return of the pet to the owner and will contact you if they have made an owner match.

Considering permanently keeping the animal you found? Pets that can be legally owned, in California, are considered personal property. According to California Penal Code 485, a person who finds and appropriates lost property without first making reasonable and just efforts to find the owner and to restore the property to the owner may be guilty of theft. It is important to report the found pet to the animal control agency servicing the area where the pet was found and to follow your jurisdiction’s policies and procedures regarding stray animals.
