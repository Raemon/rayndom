# From Shy to Shine: Alfie & Owen’s Perfect Match

Aug 5, 2025 

It all started I saw a picture of Alfie (formerly “Redvine”) on East Bay ESPA’s website. He had such a sweet face! He’d been in the Dublin shelter for several months – he was extremely shy – and I just knew that my quiet household would be a good place for him.

Over the next six months, he started to come out of his shell and to really own his new home. But he always hid anytime someone came to visit. I wondered if adopting a second cat would give him more confidence and companionship. In early June I visited the Oakland location and met Owen (formerly “Eeny”). He, too, was a shy kitty, but I thought he might be a good little brother for Alfie, so I brought him home.

After a transition period in my house so Alfie could get used to having a new critter in his space, and so Owen could become comfortable in his new environment, the time seemed right for them to meet in person. Magic happened! I couldn’t be happier with the outcome. When Alfie needs a break from Owen’s kitten energy, he hops up onto his cat tree for a little nap. Owen likes to curl up on the chair next to me while I’m working from home. Alfie and Owen get along really well. I’m so glad they have each other, and I love having their company.

I really appreciate how the staff in the Dublin and Oakland locations let me spend enough time with each cat so I could get to know them before I made my decision to adopt. Not only that, but I never felt rushed or pressured. They were very responsive to my concerns when I was ready to adopt a second cat, and they suggested several kittens they thought might be a good match for Alfie.
