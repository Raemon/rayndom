Freshman Class – In-Person

4 week class | 1 hour | Oakland, Dublin

This is the class to start with if your dog is **over 4months old** , and you are looking for a strong training foundation! This intro class is designed to build a framework of communication that you can use to teach your dog any behavior. We focus on several key exercises which you can then turn into skills like recall, calm greetings, loose leash walking, and focusing in distracting environments. 

**Prerequisites** :

None! Come with your dog, your treats, and your enthusiasm for training! Note: if your dog barks consistently or uncontrollably at other dogs from within a 10-20ft distance, you may consider taking our Calm Cool and Collected specialty reactivity class, or a private training session **before** taking Freshman to make sure they have the skills they need to be comfortable and non-disruptive in a group class environment. Not sure about your dog’s needs? Sign up for a [free behavior helpline](https://eastbayspca.org/behavior-training/behavior-training-helpline) to chat with a trainer about what class fits your dog best!

**Price** : $250 for 4 week course ($225 for adopted animals)

Sophomore Class – In-Person

4 week class | 1 hour | Oakland, Dublin

In this class you start to take your training to the next level! Once you and your dog have a good grasp of the basics and have had some practice learning in a group environment, we can start pushing the envelope.

Looking for a place to practice heel position past distractions? Sign up for Sophomore!

**Prerequisites** :

All our East Bay Canine College classes are designed to build directly on one another. **If you are signing up for Sophomore class from another organization** , we require that you have at least completed our [Clicker Training 101 webinar](https://eastbayspca.learnworlds.com/course?courseid=clicker-training-101), and that you and your dog be fluent with the following skills:

  * Clicker training basics (using your clicker to “mark” then reward the moment your dog performs the desired behavior)
  * Nose targeting (+ verbal cue)
  * Relaxation on a Mat ([as detailed in this handout](https://eastbayspca.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Relaxation-on-a-Mat.pdf))
  * Stay (+ verbal cue/release cue)



If you feel your dog is not fluent in the above, please sign up for our Freshman class before enrolling in Sophomore.

Calm, Cool, and Collected

6 week class

Does your dog bark and lunge on walks, from behind gates, or at the windows in your home? Are walks and outings frustrating, embarrassing, or even a little scary? Reactive behaviors are our most commonly requested behavior topic, and our Calm, Cool, and Collected class offers a unique class experience designed with the needs of the dogs in mind.

  * **Week 1:** Humans only. Goes over the logistics of the class, setup and logistics, several foundation behaviors to learn before week 2, and information gathering so instructors can tailor the class to the individual needs of their students. Also includes management strategies that teams can use to set their dogs up for success in their routine.

  * **Week 2:** Dogs are on site, but not in the classroom  _together_. Each team rotates through the classroom one at a time (with the others waiting in their cars or with their humans) so that they can explore the space, and practice the skills from week 1 without the pressure of the other dogs present, and get one on one feedback from the instructors. Additional skills are introduced.

  * **Week 3:** All dogs are present in the classroom, but enter, exit, and practice behind full visual barriers. Options are available at both campuses to set up the visual barrier “pods” outside the classroom if being within earshot is too much that week. Additional skills are introduced, and low-level practice scenarios (instructors as triggers, fake dogs as triggers) are explored as appropriate for each team.

  * **Week 4:** Takes the previous 3 weeks of skills and expands practice scenarios in a controlled environment. This can happen initially at very low levels if needed, such as using fake dogs, or recordings before offering visual contact.


  * **Weeks 5 and 6** are continuations of week 4, and are tailored specifically to the individual needs and comfort levels of the class. These exercises can involve outdoor parallel walks, “trigger chasing” in obstacle courses, and focus on handlers learning which practical exercises and skills are relevant for what types of “real world” situations. Week 6 offers a comprehensive overview of how teams can design a sustainable training plan utilizing their new skills.




Price: $300 for 6 week class ($275 for adopted animals)

Intro to Nosework

6 week class | 1.5 hour | Oakland, Dublin

For dogs that are 6 months and older by the first day of class.

Nosework is an easy to learn activity that uses a dog’s natural abilities for hunting to find hidden treats, toys or other items. This game builds confidence and focus as the dog is rewarded for doing what comes naturally! It’s also a safe way to provide mental and physical exercise to all types of dogs. Handlers will learn about dog body language and how to motivate your dog, which are great tools for developing your relationship with your pet!

**Prerequisites** : None.

**Behavioral Appropriateness:** Dogs work one at a time so this is a great class for dogs that are not comfortable around other dogs. Dogs must be crate trained and able to handle confinement in a crate between turns.

**Price** : $250 for 6 week class ($225 for adopted animals)

##### **Due to a lack of a certified nose work instructor, we are not currently offering Nose Work classes. If you would like to be added to our notification list, email training@eastbayspca.org and you’ll get an email when any new Nose Work classes are posted!**

## 

Nose Work 2: Introducing Odor

6 week class | 1.5 hour | Oakland, Dublin

For dogs that are 6 months and older by the first day of class.

Introducing Odor is a continuation of skills from our Intro to Nose Work Class. Dogs are taught to identify the target odors: Anise, Birch, and Clove. Skills that each handler will acquire from the class include search techniques, dog/handler teamwork and reading the dog’s body language during the search.

**Prerequisites** : Dogs and handlers must have completed Intro to Nose Work and have instructor approval to register for this class.

**Behavioral Appropriateness:** Dogs work one at a time so this is a great class for dogs that are not comfortable around other dogs. Dogs must be crate trained and able to handle confinement in a crate between turns.

**Price** : $250 for 6 week class ($225 for adopted animals)
