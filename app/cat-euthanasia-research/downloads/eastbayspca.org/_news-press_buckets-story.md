# Bucket’s Story

November 22, 2025

### Support kittens like Bucket with a donation this [Giving Tuesday](https://eastbayspca.org/donate/giving-tuesday)

Bucket came to East Bay SPCA by way of a thoughtful and cat-savvy good Samaritan, as a three-week-old neonate kitten. She was found alone, and brought to us in a white, plastic bucket. Her rescuer had seen a mother leave one kitten behind, and spent several days observing whether she would return. When she didn’t, they knew they had to intervene and give the newborn a chance.

Bucket came in howling — she was hungry, covered in fleas, and desperate for the love and care she deserved. Upon being brought to us, she was immediately bathed, dried, and fed before being paired with an experienced neonate foster. At East Bay SPCA, we receive hundreds of neonatal kittens each year, and we could not save them without the dedication of these amazing volunteers who provide round-the-clock care, including bottle feeding and constant monitoring.

After a brief setback where she lost a bit of weight, her foster and our Shelter Medicine staff worked closely to bring her back to full health. Once she was strong and ready, Bucket was made available at our Oakland adoption center, and adopted within days. She continues to bring unlimited amounts of joy and love to her  
new family.

Bucket’s story is one of many reminders that the patience and compassion of people — from her rescuer to her foster to our amazing staff and community of supporters — can give even the tiniest of kittens a second chance.

## Kitten Season

Each year we see an increase in orphaned kittens as the weather warms, with intake for neonates peaking in spring and summer, leading to a large number of available animals in the fall.

Through the power of our dedicated [foster community](https://eastbayspca.org/how-to-help/become-volunteer-foster/foster), these infant strays receive continuous care until they’re old enough to return to the shelter to meet potential adopters.
