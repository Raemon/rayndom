# Behavior & Training Helpline

Our Behavior & Training Helpline provides information and assistance to dog and cat owners experiencing common behavior challenges. Visit our Behavior & Training Resource Library for more helpful information.

If you or someone else has been injured by your pet, please seek medical attention. If you are located in the Bay Area and your pet is experiencing a medical emergency, please go to your [nearest emergency veterinary office](https://eastbayspca.org/about/locations-and-hours).

We provide the following services.

  * Free 15-minute phone consultation to discuss basic tips surrounding your dog or cat’s behavior challenge with a member of our behavior and training team.

  * 30-minute phone consultation ($30 fee) to discuss your dog or cat’s behavior challenge as well as management and training tips. Proceeds go to support the programs and services at East Bay SPCA.

  * Private training session (available for dogs and cats).
