# Chosen by Phoebe

Jul 1, 2025 

My cat of 16 years passed away, and our family was having a hard time. My boys, who haven’t known a day without a cat, were very upset and wanted to check out the cats at the shelter. So when adoption day came, I surprised them with a visit, and they fell in love with Phoebe.

I wasn’t sure since I still was grieving, but seeing them so happy and since we had just moved and were starting a new chapter, I thought, why not add to the experience? As a single mom, it was a relief that the adoption fees were waived and we received a coupon for necessities.

Phoebe is so funny and playful. She is a great snuggle buddy and is constantly purring. She loves playing with the boys and all the new toys we bought for her. She is growing quickly and is always on the go in typical kitten fashion.

The process was so smooth, and allowing us to stay as long as we wanted in the enclosure with her was what helped me come around. She was pretty shy in the beginning, but then she came out and just snuggled on my lap. Once the volunteer came by and said, “It looks like she chose you.” That was it!
