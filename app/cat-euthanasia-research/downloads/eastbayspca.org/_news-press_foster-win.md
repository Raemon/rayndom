# Foster Win: Whiskey’s Journey Home

December 22, 2025

## 

Whiskey came to East Bay SPCA alongside several other strays from San Leandro. A good Samaritan found the group living in a work yard and brought them to safety. A large laceration on his lip, his uncertain gaze, and fearful body language indicated a challenging life as a stray and limited positive human contact. Staff recalled how he “pancaked” to the ground when walked on leash, and froze in place inside his kennel, unsure if he could trust  
anyone.

After his wound was treated by our Shelter Medicine team, Whiskey’s next step was emotional healing. Our Behavior & Training staff created a care plan to help him feel safe again, giving him extra space, quiet moments, and time to build confidence. It didn’t take long for us to notice Whiskey opening up around another shy dog named Cognac. The two were soon fostered together, where their friendship blossomed. Behavior staff noted how Whiskey’s body language softened when Cognac was near, his tail relaxed, his eyes brightened, and he began to explore with curiosity. Time away from the shelter allowed both  
dogs to find calm together.

With a buddy by his side, Whiskey began to eat regularly, wag his tail, and show a playful side we hadn’t seen before. Over time, he became more and more comfortable with staff and volunteers, and was a regular visitor to staff offices.

After Cognac was adopted, it was Whiskey’s turn. His foster caregiver, Leigh, had seen him come so far and knew she couldn’t say goodbye. She adopted him herself, giving him  
the new home he’d been waiting for.

Whiskey is now living his best life with Leigh and her family. Once a timid stray, he’s become a confident, affectionate companion who loves being near his people. His favorite spots are the couch, snuggled up beside the kids as they play video games, and the sunny patch of grass in the backyard where he naps contentedly.

He’s even learned to enjoy car rides, knowing they usually lead to something fun. Every day, Whiskey shows just how much love a rescue dog has to give. His journey from scared stray to beloved family member is proof that patience and compassion can truly change a life.

Every day our volunteer and foster communities make stories like these possible! Opportunities are flexible to suite your schedule, plus we provide training and supplies.
