# Volunteer Turned Pet Parent: Apollo’s Adoption Tale

Feb 2, 2024 

When I started volunteering at the EBSPCA, I had a long talk with myself. I knew I’d want to adopt all of the dogs. I convinced myself I had the willpower to only volunteer. Epic fail!!! I saw Apollo on the website and he stole my heart. When I peeked in the kennels before my shift and he whined at me, it was a done deal!

Apollo is the biggest cuddle bug. We “lose” him regularly only to find him under blankets or in a bed. He and my other dog are about the same age and have become buddies. Apollo is the comedian of the house and is always finding ways to make us laugh and fall in love with him all over again. 

The East Bay SPCA staff is wonderful. Truly. Working at the front desk, I have seen how patient and loving they are to every animal as well as every potential adopter. They gave me plenty of time and space before adopting to see if it was a good match and it’s great knowing East Bay SPCA is there if if have future questions or need resources.
