# Nyx, Bringer of Affection and Ankle Attacks

Apr 1, 2025 

Nyx reminds a handler that She alone decides who leaves and when. Nyx continues to be a bottomless font of affection and energy; If she’s awake, she’s purring. In fact, with one of her eyes gone it’s one of the only reliable ways to tell if she is sleeping or not.

After much deliberation, Cornucopia became Nyx. I had originally thought to name her Ginko, but the wordplay between the Greek personification of the night and the “nixing” of one of her eyes was just too good, especially with her moon-gold eye. She looks real sharp in a matching yellow collar.

Nyx is also a bottomless font of crimes and violence. She loves to bite anything she can get her jaw around the blinds in our new apartment, her adopted sister Tonsi, or somebody’s leg that shifted under the blanket at 2am.

Nyx is sharp, both figuratively and literally. It doesn’t take her very long to improvise her way around any barrier. Especially if that barrier is between her and food.

This is the sleeping posture of an apex predator.

It took us a bit to learn how to co-feed a voracious kitten and an elderly cat, and Nyx developed what the nice lady at Four Paws calls a “Flupa.” I’m still unclear on if adding the L to fupa is to emphasize floppiness or floofiness, but Nyx has both in spades. The vet has asked us to keep an eye on it, in case it starts to present mobility issues or indicates a problem with the spay site. I think maybe she just stress-ate her way through the adoption and acclimation process, and the flupa is the first of many signs of a new life, well lived. Also, she can use all that storage for extra crimes.

You may not like it, but this is what peak feline performance looks like.

All jokes aside, Nyx might objectively be the best cat. Absolutely legendary pull.

Nyx isn’t quite a lap cat, but she enjoys being close to the family in her occasional still moments.

I am eternally grateful to the East Bay SPCA for putting Nyx and I in touch when we needed each other most. She has definitely found her forever home with Shawna and I.
