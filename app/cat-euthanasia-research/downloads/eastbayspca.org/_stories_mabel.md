# Mabel: From Shy Stray to Heartwarming Companion

Dec 19, 2023 

Mabel entered my life as a timid cat, accompanied by a cautionary note from the staff about her potential lack of affection. However, the moment she sat close to me in the adoption room, I knew I had found a special bond. It took a few hours at home for Mabel to overcome her initial fears and start cuddling up with me, eventually sleeping on my chest. Now, months later, she has evolved into the most loving creature I’ve ever known. Despite moments of anxiety, she places her trust in me and spends every night (and day!) snuggled up and lying beside me. Adopting Mabel has proven to be the most rewarding decision I’ve ever made.
