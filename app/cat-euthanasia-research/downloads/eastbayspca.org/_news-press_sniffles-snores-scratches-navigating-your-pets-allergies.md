# Sniffles, Snores & Scratches: Navigating Your Pet’s Allergies

February 25, 2025

Spring is almost here, and for humans, that can come with seasonal allergies. Did you know that our pets can also have allergies? When a pet is exposed to something they are allergic to, their immune system reacts, causing inflammation resulting in itching and at times, gastrointestinal upset. Cats tend to scratch around their face and neck creating scabbing and hair loss. Dogs commonly scratch their face, chew on their legs and feet, scoot their rump on the floor and have recurrent ear infections. Both species can create secondary infections as they try to relieve themselves by scratching.

## Allergies in cats and dogs can be caused by three things: fleas, food, and the environment. 

### Those Pesky Fleas

Here in the Bay Area, our seasons are not extreme enough to cause fleas to go dormant. Once fleas are in the environment, it takes a minimum of three months to stop the current flea problem, which is why we recommend year-round flea prevention. Even if you are not seeing fleas, it only takes one flea to bite your pet for them to react to the flea saliva.

### Food Allergies

Pets can be allergic to proteins, carbohydrates, all the way down to dyes and preservatives. There is currently not an accurate diagnostic test to check what food pets are allergic to, which is why food trials are recommended. The best way to determine what foods are causing the allergy is to do an elimination diet. By removing foods from their diet, the pet is only exposed to limited ingredients for eight to twelve weeks at a time. This requires diligence and consistent observation, as any outside source of food, even a single treat, can disrupt the entire food trial. As the trial continues, different ingredients can be introduced one at a time to see if there is an allergic reaction.

### Environmental Allergies

The medical term for a pet that has environmental allergies is atopy or atopic dermatitis. Some of the common causes of this type of allergy are pollens, dust, dust mites and molds. Some pets will only have allergies during the season they are exposed, while others have allergies year-round depending on the environment. Treatment for environmental allergies can be complicated and utilize trial and error. Some of the treatment options include medicated shampoos, oral medication, injections and/or customized immunotherapy.

Some breeds of dogs are pre-disposed to having allergies including Shar-Peis, Golden Retrievers, Dalmatians, Boxers, Boston Terriers, Labrador Retrievers, Lhasa Apsos, Shih Tzus, West Highland White Terrier, Bull Terriers, German Shepherds, and any dog that has a “blue” coat.

Winnie, a four-month-old Bull Terrier, came to East Bay SPCA’s [Theodore B. Travers Family Veterinary Clinic](https://eastbayspca.org/vet-clinic) already showing symptoms of allergies. She was placed on appropriate year-round flea prevention and given a long-lasting anti-itch injection. It was quickly recognized that any time Winnie would walk in grass she would break out in hives or start itching incessantly. Jocelyn, Winnie’s pet parent states, “Winnie loves grass, and it is the only place she will go potty; it is up to me to make sure I wipe down her paws with medicated wipes every time she walks in grass to help prevent a flare up of itching.”

Winnie was also showing signs of food allergies, so Jocelyn started food trials to see what she could eat without causing symptoms. At 18 ~~–~~ months of age, Winnie became eligible for environmental allergy testing. This tests for common grasses, weeds, and trees in our area. Winnie is allergic to 13 out of 13 grasses, 14 out of 18 weeds, and 32 out of 33 trees that were tested. “I knew Bull Terriers could have allergies, but I never imagined it would be this severe,” says Jocelyn.

With the results of the environmental allergy testing, custom immunotherapy medications were created for Winnie to help keep her comfortable. Even with all of Jocelyn’s compliance and follow-~~~~ up care, it took almost four years to get all of Winnie’s allergies under control. “I am dedicated to keeping her comfortable, but it does require a lot of management.” Winnie’s treatment plan includes a prescription diet, daily oral medication, an anti-itch injection every four weeks, immunotherapy treatment, and medicated baths once to twice a week. Even with that~~,~~ there are times that her allergies flare, requiring additional steroids and antibiotics.

While there is no simple cure for allergies, treatments and guidance provided by a trained veterinarian can ensure relief from health issues so they can enjoy a much higher quality of life. General practitioners, such as veterinarians at the Theodore B Travers Family Veterinary Clinic, can offer a lot of options for topical and oral medications, and they can also refer severe cases to a veterinary dermatologist as needed. Specialists like these can provide even more insight and recommendations to help in complicated cases and ensure each animal is able to enjoy life regardless of the discomfort that allergies can sometimes cause.
