# Shelter Scouts

Experiential learning and service opportunities for ages 8-17 at our Oakland and Dublin campuses. 

Shelter Scouts is an immersive opportunity where youth develop empathy, compassion, and a deeper understanding of animal welfare through hands-on, on-site programs. Our Calico Crew (ages 8-11) and Rover Recruits (ages 12-17) programs are intentionally designed to meet the developmental needs of each age group. 

Sessions are guided by our Humane Education team––no parents or guardian supervision required. 

Calico Crew (Ages 8-11)

### 1-day modules | Saturdays or Sundays | 1.5 hours | $50/module

Our newest youth program explores animal care through games, crafts, and supervised meet-and-greets with shelter pets. Participants can join one or multiple modules. Each module will include safe, supervised, hands-on animal interaction.

Rover Recruits (Ages 12-17)

### 3-week sessions | Saturdays or Sundays | 2 hours/week | $100/session

Older youth have the chance to deepen their understanding of animal welfare through shelter tasks, animal socialization, enrichment prep, and more. Each 3-week session features new content, activities, and animal interactions. Youth are encouraged to enroll in multiple sessions to continue building skills and experience.
