# Tiny Paws, Big Heart: Fostering Neonatal Kittens

March 6, 2025

## It’s March and Kitten Season is upon Us! 

Each year during Kitten Season (roughly March-October) our [foster program](https://eastbayspca.org/how-to-help/become-volunteer-foster/foster) places hundreds of kittens a month into temporary homes. Out of the 1,088 dogs and cats we placed through our foster program in 2023, more than 600 were neonate kittens (birth to four weeks old).

It’s that time of year again, and our foster team are gearing up for another busy season of care. From round-the-clock bottle feeding and support for kittens post-surgery, to care for full litters of young cats, our foster volunteers are integral to the health and wellness of our feline population.

### One of Our Neonatal Kitten Fosters Shares her Reflections:

Fosters like our friend~~,~~ Jaime help us to offer support to municipal shelters, and place well-nurtured kittens into homes each year.

Jaime is new to our foster team, but not new to fostering. She began fostering 20 years ago with a local feline rescue, joining East Bay SPCA as a kitten foster in 2024. Jaime provides shelter, companionship, and plenty of love and affection for cats too young to be listed for adoption.

“I have space and the time and want to help however I can,” says Jaime. Last year a foster kitten named McRib found a special place in her heart ~~–~~ and ended up staying for good. “My dog and I fell in love, and now he’s Miles Davis, and part of our family,” she says, calling him a “foster win.”

Jaime recognizes that it can be challenging to develop a bond with an animal who will eventually need to leave the nest. Even though it’s difficult to say goodbye, she says it’s worth it in the end. “I like feeling like I’m making a difference, at least short term, in these kittens’ lives. Giving them love and attention they’ve maybe never had before and setting them up for success in finding their forever home.”

### Taking part this kitten season starts with joining our dynamic foster community, for more information visit: [eastbayspca.org/foster](https://eastbayspca.org/how-to-help/become-volunteer-foster/foster).

## Tiny neonate kittens require a bit more care but only for a little while.
