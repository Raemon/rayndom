# Lance’s Love Story and Irresistible Meow

Nov 3, 2023 

Originally, I entered East Bay SPCA with the intention of getting one or two kittens for my friend. After all, a bigger house calls for more furry companions! However, deep down, I knew I wouldn’t leave without a cat that truly needed me. As we spent time with the kittens, Goatee (formerly Lance) stood out—he kept expressing his affection and jumping onto my lap. Even through the window, it seemed like he already knew I was meant to be his human. His meow was undeniably the cutest! It brought back memories of middle school, where I had a crush on a boy named Lance. He would only engage with me by yelling, especially when I didn’t give him attention. He unquestionably felt like a feline soulmate.
