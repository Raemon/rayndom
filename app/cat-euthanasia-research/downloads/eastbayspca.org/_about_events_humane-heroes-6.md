# Humane Heroes [Oakland]

## June 30, 2025 @ 9:00 am \- July 3, 2025 @ 3:00 pm

Grade Range: entering 4th-6th grade

Do you know a child who wants to work with animals when they grow up? Why wait! This session investigates different ways that kids can help pets in our community. Campers will explore the world of animal welfare through innovative activities, games, and animal meet-and-greets. As Humane Heroes, campers will learn important lessons on empathy, advocacy, and consent through the lens of animal care. They will assist in socializing shelter animals, creating enrichment, and making adoption ads to give our harder to adopt animals some extra love and attention while in our care. Campers will leave knowing they made a paw-sitive impact in the lives of our shelter animals.

OAKLAND | 8323 BALDWIN ST • 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.

June 30th-July 3rd- Registration will open Feb 1
