# Rocky’s Happy Tail: From Shelter to Snuggles

Mar 12, 2024 

When we decided we were ready to adopt we looked at the website and headed in to look at a pup that we thought would maybe be a good fit. We met him and he was great, but I couldn’t help but notice the sweet guy that wagged his butt (not just tail!) when I said hi through the kennel door. We asked to meet him as well and it only took a few minutes to absolutely fall in love with Rocky.

Rocky is a dream dog and over the last several days we’ve asked ourselves how it’s possible such a perfect pup exists! We were prepared to need to work on house training and basic commands, and all the other stuff that comes with being a pet parent, but from the moment we opened the car door to leave the shelter and Rocky jumped in like he had done it a thousand times, we’ve learned we have a perfect gentleman! Completely housebroken, knows basic commands, walks well on a leash, and wants nothing more than to just lay by your side on the sofa and snore, loudly.

I’ve always known that shelter dogs are amazing, but Rocky has been such a reminder of this. I’ve been telling everyone who will listen to please consider adopting from a shelter when you’re considering a new furry family member.

Rocky just makes my day better! Everyone who meets him smiles and he is so happy to know everyone. He LOVES people, and having him around brings joy.

East Bay SPCA was so patient with us as we spent time with a few dogs. They gave us space to try and connect while also answering as many questions as they possible could. I have so much admiration for the people who are taking care of these sweet souls while they wait for a home.
