# A Cozy Place in the Sun for Sunny

Sep 12, 2024 

I’ve been wanting a cat for most of my life and didn’t have a chance to adopt one until this year. After many searches, I came across East Bay SPCA, walking in I didn’t expect to fall so much in love with Pegasus. He was immediately such a sweet boy when my partner and I saw him for the first time. He would crash down when we pet him, and always tried to go to the sunny spots (that’s why we decided to name him Sunny, he adores the sun so much!). Sunny has been the best boy ever!

He quickly adapted to his new home and developed a bond with everyone in the family right away. Sunny’s cute personality has really come out now — he is sometimes a sassy playful boy in the morning and then by the evening, he loves to cuddle before bed. I’m so happy we found each other!

East Bay SPCA’s staff were very attentive and helpful! They helped introduce us to Sunny and gave us good advice as first-time pet owners.
