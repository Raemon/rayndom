Danielle Cruz, D.V.M. 

+

-

Dr. Danielle Cruz is a Vacaville native where her earliest memory consists of her pretending to be a veterinarian with her stuffed animals and her loyal cat Sarge. She can’t remember a time that she thought she might want to be anything other than a veterinarian. This drive propelled her through her academic endeavors, culminating in a Bachelor of Science in Animal Biology from UC Davis in 2019, followed by her Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from Midwestern University College of Veterinary Medicine in 2024. Notably, Dr. Cruz proudly stands as a first-generation college graduate. After spending four years in Arizona, she was elated to return to the Bay Area with her cats Teddy (a tripod) and Smelly Ellie. She has a suspicion that her family will be growing as she falls in love with East Bay SPCA’s adoptable animals. In her free time, she enjoys a good hike, the suspense of horror movies, and attempting to crochet.

Gwen Gadd, D.V.M.

Dr. Gwen Gadd relocated to the Bay area in 2011 and fell in love with diversity and beauty here. She graduated with her degree in veterinary medicine from Colorado State University in 1996. In addition to working full time at the East Bay SPCA Gwen works for her dog as a tennis ball procurement specialist. In her spare time Gwen enjoys crafting, photography, exploring the Bay area and anything that allows her to learn.

Dr. Julia Olincy D.V.M.

PelJulia’s career path has been as varied as it is inspiring. Formerly a business litigation lawyer in California, she eventually relocated to Dallas, Texas, where she became deeply involved with a grassroots animal rescue organization. This transformative experience ignited her passion for animal health and inspired her to pursue further education in veterinary medicine.

Julia earned her veterinary certification from UC Davis. Most recently, she served at Sage Veterinary Center’s Urgent Care, where she honed her skills in providing compassionate, high-quality care.

Outside of work, Julia is a proud pet parent to Surrey, an adorable dog, and two cats, Toast and Tusker. We are thrilled to welcome Julia to the Theodore B. Travers Veterinary Clinic and are excited to have her expertise on our dedicated and knowledgeable team.
