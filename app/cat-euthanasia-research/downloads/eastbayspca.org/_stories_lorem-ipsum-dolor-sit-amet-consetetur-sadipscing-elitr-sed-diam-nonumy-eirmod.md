# Billie Finds New Lease on Life

Sep 18, 2023 

“I knew I wanted another dog to keep me outside and to be a companion to me and my senior chi-weenie. When I met Billie (known as Kaya at the time) at the East Bay SPCA, I fell in love with her. When staff introduced us, she warned that Billie could be a little standoff-ish. However, when Billie came into the courtyard, she ran straight up to me and licked my face. We played a little and she ran around a bit. She was so goofy and sweet.

  
Billie has grown so much. She loves people, loves going outside, and thrives off of routine. Watching her learn to play with my small senior chi-weenie was one of my favorite things. She’s so goofy and loves laying out in the sun outside on her cot. We are so lucky that she became part of our family. She is such a good girl. I’m so proud of how far she has come, and I know the loving staff at East Bay SPCA would be too.

I appreciate the staff and volunteers who looked after Billie. The love they give these animals and the connection they make during their stay (whether it be a short, long, or a returning one) is unmatched and tangible.” 

-Claire, Adopter
