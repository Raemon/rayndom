**Seniors for Seniors:** This program seeks to increase older animals’ chances of finding a new home while also improving the health and quality of life of senior citizens. East Bay SPCA staff will help you select a senior pet (age 7 and up) who fits into your lifestyle and housing situation. To make it as easy as possible for seniors to adopt, adoption fees for senior pets are waived for adopters 65 and above.

**Military Veterans:** Our Veterans Adoption Program aims to pair veterans of the United States Armed forces with adoptable animals in need of a home. We recognize the many benefits that a companion animal can have and our staff will be available to help match a veteran with an animal that best fits their lifestyle. We waive adoption fees for military veterans who show their driver’s license or ID card with the “VETERAN” designation on it at the time of adoption.

**Pawspice:** Our Pawspice Adoption Program aims to find loving homes faster for animals with complex or terminal medical conditions who still have a high quality of life. Thanks to our generous donors, adopters who provide a permanent home to Pawspice animals have their adoption fees waived, and the animal can receive medical care (for known conditions—speak to shelter staff for more information) at our Theodore B. Travers Family Veterinary Clinic in Oakland for the remainder of their lives.

**Club Second Chance:** This program helps highlight senior animals and animals with special needs. Animals with the Club Second Chance icon will have discounted adoption fees.

**Long Term Animals** : For animals that have spent more than two months in our care, it’s important to get them in their homes soon so they can decompress from their longer-than-average stay. These pets have waived adoption fees. Look for the 2+ Month banners to find our long-term cats and dogs.

**Bonded Animals:** The quality of life for a bonded pair is highly dependent on remaining with its companion. This program is designed to make placing bonded pairs into homes easier by reducing adoption fees. Adopt one animal, and its bonded companion will have a waived adoption fee.

Please note that while our website updates in real-time, we cannot guarantee the availability of any animal.
