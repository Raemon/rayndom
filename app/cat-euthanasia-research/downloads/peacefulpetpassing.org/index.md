## Reviews

 _"I'm so grateful to have found Dr. Bob via Yelp. My baby girl got sick very quickly and unexpectedly and I knew I wanted her to have a peaceful passing in her own home as comfortable as possible. Dr. Bob managed to come to our home same day. He was so professional and compassionate. It really takes a special person to have such a business and I am so incredibly grateful that he offers this service because there's none other out there that do. My best furfriend passed away without any pain, fear, quickly, and on her favorite blanket with me right next to her the whole time."_

_"Where do I even begin? Experiencing the loss of a pet is incredibly difficult and heart-wrenching. Making the decision to opt for euthanasia for my pet, given her terminal cancer, was one of the hardest choices I've had to face. Yet, in that challenging moment, Dr. Sherry's patience, understanding and kindness truly stood out. She approached my beloved Bubbles with such tenderness, and her ability to clearly explain the process to both me and my family was remarkable. Her compassion and humanity were evident, providing comfort during a profoundly difficult time. It takes an exceptional person to navigate such sensitive situations with grace, and Dr. Sherry is undoubtedly one of those rare individuals. If you are considering at-home euthanasia, I highly recommend Dr. Sherry. Her approach is not only comprehensive and detailed, but she also ensures the experience is as comfortable and respectful as possible under the circumstances."_

_"One of the saddest decisions to let your fur baby go. Dr. Bob and Dr. Sherry were the kindest most understanding professionals ever. The service they provided for my big girl was the best I could ask for. She got to stay in her own home and be surrounded with familiarity instead of being taken in a stressful car ride to the stressful vet. I'm so glad I chose Peaceful Pet Passing!"_

_"Dr. Bob Linett answered the phone when I called to make an appointment to put my 10 year old baby to rest. He was informative, patient, and empathetic. I fully understood what to expect when his daughter Dr. Sherry Linett arrived. She was compassionate, professional and validated our decision with empathy. There were a couple moments when I didn't know how to act or what to say to comfort our put. She filled the gap with soft-spoken sweet comments and light pets. I'm so grateful. If the time comes again, I will call this company and will always recommend their services to anyone in need. It's the hardest decision to make and having the right people there for you is a blessing."_

_"I called our vet, Antioch Hospital on Deer Valley for any at home euthanasia recommendations. They recommended Peaceful Pet Passing to us with Dr. Bob and Dr. Sherry. Dr. Sherry met us in our backyard to help us with our beloved pitbull Lucy. She was so kind and empathetic. One of the nicest humans you can meet, especially in these circumstances. I wouldn't hesitate to tell anyone that needs this service to go with Dr. Sherry and Peaceful Pet Passing. Thanks again Dr. Sherry for making our difficult time as good as it could be."_

_"It's very sad when our pets cross over the Rainbow Bridge, but this service made a painful experience far more tolerable. Dr. Bob came to our home to euthanize our German Shepherd, who had cancer. He was very professional, kind and compassionate. We did not have to traumatize our dog with a trip to the vet's office. She passed away peacefully and quickly in our living room, lying on her own blanket, with my husband and me right at her side. This is the most humane way to say farewell to a beloved pet. I highly recommend Peaceful Pet Passing."_

_"Our sweet 12 year old Golden, Russell is now resting peacefully in doggie heaven. Dr. Bob and Anna came to our home this morning in Trilogy to help release Russell free of pain & now chasing squirrels for fun and eating whatever he wants. Dr. Bob is so compassionate, respectful and helped us through this very difficult decision. For my husband, Russ and myself it was so comforting to say our goodbyes in our own home and stress free for our Russell boy. Many thanks to Dr. Bob & Anna. You both helped us more than you'll ever know."_

_" 'Lord' was my first K9 partner; we lived, worked and played together for over 12 years. I loved him dearly, and I know he loved me in return. He was fiercely loyal and was happiest in the back of a patrol car, making sure everyone close by knew he was there and protecting who needed protecting. Even after he retired, he continued to love his car rides - it made no difference to him if it was his patrol car or the back of my Honda. We were able to give him one last car ride in the back of a patrol car; he couldn't stand up in the back anymore, but he certainly barked at everything and everyone he could hear and smell. After that final ride, Dr. Bob met us at our home, where Lord remained in his favorite place, in the back of 'his' car in our driveway. I was able to snuggle up next to him as he fell asleep. He was so peaceful and went so quietly - quite the contradiction to his usual behavior in a car. I knew he felt no pain, and he knew I was beside him. In his final moments, I protected him as he had protected me for so long - we were each other's 'peace'. I love you my dear friend and protector; I will forever have you in my heart. THANK YOU, Dr. Bob, for giving me this blessed way to say 'so long for now' to my dear, sweet Lord."_
