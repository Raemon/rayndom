# Use of Veterinary Acupuncture for Pain Management & More

If your pet suffers from chronic pain, arthritis, or the discomfort of gastrointestinal issues, acupuncture may be able to help relieve your pet's pain and help your pet feel better. Today, our Berkeley vets discuss veterinary acupuncture for pain management and more.

## Acupuncture & Tradition Chinese Veterinary Medicine (TCVM)

Acupuncture is a treatment that has been used for centuries in China to relieve pain and treat a host of illnesses in people. Now vets trained in traditional Chinese veterinary medicine (TCVM) are able to offer animal acupuncture as well.

**Acupuncture** for pets is performed by a trained TCVM veterinary professional and aims to treat and manage the symptoms of illnesses and disorders by inserting ultra-thin needles into specific points on the body where nerves and blood vessels intersect.

TCVM, which also includes other therapies beyond acupuncture, can be combined with conventional veterinary care to provide a more holistic, full-body approach to treating medical conditions in animals.

Animals at any stage of life from puppies and kittens to adult and senior pets can undergo acupuncture treatment for a range of health conditions. Cat and dog acupuncture treatments are considered a safe and effective therapy that may provide relief from the pain or discomfort associated with injury and illness.

### How Pet Acupuncture is Performed

It is essential to determine the underlying cause of your pet's symptoms before any type of treatment can begin. Once the cause of your cat or dog's symptoms is known, treatment can be focused on your animal's specific health issue.

The aim of pet or canine acupuncture is to help your animal's body heal itself by resetting the balance of energy throughout the body, known as "chi". This is done by inserting a series of fine needles into the animal's body at specific points where blood vessels and nerves intersect. Although the process is virtually painless, endorphins, which are the body's natural pain-killers, are released. This process helps to relieve your animal's acute and chronic pain or discomfort.

It is also believed that the acupuncture process stimulates the release of serotonin which can help to reduce your pet's anxiety levels and generate feelings of contentment and happiness.

Other forms of TCVM can include acupressure, aquapuncture, laser energy, electrostimulation, and other alternative therapies.

### Benefits of Veterinary Acupuncture

Veterinary acupuncture and other traditional Chinese treatments are designed to elicit a number of health benefits while avoiding the negative side effects that can be brought on by some conventional medications and treatments.

Benefits of veterinary acupuncture for dogs and cats include:

  * Stimulating the release of endorphins, which are the body's natural pain relievers, and anti-inflammatory substances.
  * No negative side effects on internal organs, as can occur with some prescription medications.
  * There are no adverse interactions with other medications or supplements, making acupuncture a safe treatment for animals undergoing conventional treatments.
  * Acupuncture treatments are believed to create elevated blood flow and increased oxygenation as well as improved metabolic and toxic waste removal.
  * Localized pain relief may be achieved at the site of needle insertion due to the relaxation of the muscles in that area.



### Conditions That Can Be Treated with Animal Acupuncture

Veterinary acupuncture can be used to help treat a range of pet health issues involving inflammation or chronic pain. Some of the conditions our team treats using feline or canine acupuncture include:

#### Metabolic Diseases

Acupuncture is believed to help with metabolic disorders by regulating your pet's endocrine system, improving digestion, and relieving oxidative stress. Acupuncture treatment also aims to improve blood flow to the tissues which boosts oxygenation and the removal of toxins and metabolic waste.

#### Arthritis

The pain and discomfort from arthritis may also be relieved with acupuncture for pets due to the release of endorphins. In some cases acupuncture treatment may reduce the need for conventional pain medications. Acupuncture can also used to relieve pain in pets who are unable to tolerate conventional pain medications.

#### Degenerative Joint Disease

Joint disease is common in pets and can seriously impact your pet's quality of life. Acupuncture aims to decrease the pain and tension associated with joint issues, making movement easier for your cat or dog.

#### Cancer

When veterinary acupuncture is used as a cancer treatment the primary goal is to stimulate blood flow and support the pet's immune system in order to help improve the body's ability to heal itself naturally. Animal acupuncture treatments can also be helpful in relieving the side effects associated with conventional cancer treatments. 

#### Trauma

If your pet has experienced an injury or trauma, such as an accident, fall, or fight, inflammation and pain may result. Acupuncture and other traditional Chinese veterinary medicines can be used to treat these symptoms and help your pet recover and return to good health.
