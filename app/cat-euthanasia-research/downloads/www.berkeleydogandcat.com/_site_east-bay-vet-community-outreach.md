[Book Online](/site/book-online) [ (510) 848-5041 ](tel:5108485041)

At Berkeley Dog & Cat Hospital we believe in giving back to our community. We're passionate about our community and are always looking for more ways to get involved!

### Humane Society

We have assisted Berkeley Humane Society by providing veterinary services after their building burned down in a fire and helped them raise money for a new facility.

### City of Berkeley Animal Services

We have also continuously worked very closely with the City of Berkeley Animal Services in order to provide discounted veterinary care on an after-hours and emergency basis.

##### Happy Tails from Clients

  * Over the course of two years I've brought all three of my dogs into this facility, some appointments were regular check-ups and some were emergency services. I have left there feeling confident, informed and well taken care of.
