### Scratchpay FAQs

The following are some of the FAQs asked by our clients about the financing options provided by Scratchpay.

  * What is Scratchpay?

Scratchpay is a simple financing solution, designed to provide simple and transparent payment plans for financing the costs associated with veterinary care in addition to other healthcare costs.

  * How do I apply for Scratchpay?

Applicants for Scratchpay financing must be U.S. Residents that are 18 years of age or older. Children under the age of 18 are not eligible to participate in the offerings on this website.

  * Is Scratchpay accepted by all veterinary clinics?

  * What kind of medical bills can I use Scratchpay to pay?

As long as your veterinarian is a Scratchpay partner like Berkeley Dog & Cat Hospital, you can apply to use Scratchpay to create payment plans for as may expenses as you need.

Applying will not affect your credit score and you will be informed about what plans are available for your pet's care within seconds of applying.

  * Is there any other important information that I need to know?

    * All payment plans and loans are subject to approval and, with respect to the loan, the rate for which individual borrowers qualify may vary based on individual credit history and other factors.
    * 12 and 24 month Scratch Plans require a $15.00 down payment to obtain financing, which will be refunded if you do not use your plan.
    * Bi-weekly Plans require a 20% down payment of the total amount financed, with the remaining amount financed split equally among the four remaining payments due every two weeks. Loan amounts range from $35 to $1,000 and 0% APR. Late payments or payments of less than the full amount may result in late fees. For example, a $200 Bi-weekly Plan would require a 20% down payment of $40. Four equal payments of $40 would be due every two weeks thereafter.
    * Scratch Plans are available in 6, 12, 18, and 24 month terms, range in loan amounts from $150 to $10,000, and with annual percentage rates (APR) ranging from 0% to 36% with the lowest rates for borrowers with exceptional credit scores. Monthly payment amounts on a Scratch Plan will depend on the term length, amount financed, and APR. For example, a 12-month Scratch Plan for $10,000 with 5.99% APR would have 12 monthly payments of $860.62 for a total repayment amount of $10,327.44. Signing for a Scratch Plan means the borrower agrees to make all payments in full and on the scheduled due dates. A borrower may incur late fees for partial or late payments that may result in higher interest charges and repayment schedule. 12 and 24 month plans require a $15 down payment due immediately.
    * Scratch Pay plans in the U.S. are issued by WebBank, while in Canada, they are issued by ©Scratch Financial, Inc. ©Scratchpay (NMLS ID#: 1582666). Eligibility is required for these loan products.
