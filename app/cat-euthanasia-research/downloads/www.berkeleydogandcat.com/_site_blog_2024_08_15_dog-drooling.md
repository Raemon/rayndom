# Why is my dog drooling? How can I stop my dog's drooling?

Drooling isn't something most pet parents look for in a dog, but it is normal for many of the breeds we have come to love. What causes drooling in dogs? How do you stop a dog from drooling? Find out here.

## Dog Drool - Not Just Gross Slobber

Your dog's saliva is about 98% water, but it also contains antibacterial compounds, enzymes, and electrolytes that are essential for good health. This enzyme-rich fluid is produced by glands near the jaw and moves into the mouth via ducts.

Amylase is an enzyme found in saliva that performs the important function of getting the digestive process started. Amylase interacts with food during chewing and helps to break it down. Saliva also moistens the chewed food and aids in the formation of a bolus, which aids in swallowing. A moist mouth is more comfortable than a dry mouth and improves the taste of food.

By washing away food particles that would otherwise cling to teeth, saliva helps to reduce the formation of cavities and prevent tooth decay, and saliva's antibacterial properties even help to reduce germs in the mouth that cause bad breath.

Saliva is beneficial, but too much of it can be harmful. Excess saliva fills the dog's mouth, runs over the brim, and the drooling begins. When a dog produces excessive saliva, they are unlikely to swallow it all. Overall, saliva is beneficial, but excessive production can cause health problems.

### Breeds Known for Their Drooling

Drooling now and again is normal for all dogs, but some breeds drool more than others. St Bernards, bulldogs, bloodhounds, Mastiffs, Newfoundlers, and Bernese mountain dogs are among them. Excessive drooling in these breeds isn't always normal, so it's a good idea to keep track of your dog's normal level of drooling.

### Why Dogs Drool

There are many causes of drooling in dogs. It could be any of the factors below:

#### Smelling Food

Because your dog has over 200 million scent receptors your pup's salivary glands will have a strong reaction whenever your pooch smells their food, or even when you simply open the dog food bag.

#### Nausea

These include gastrointestinal (GI) issues, vestibular (balance) issues, and motion sickness. If your dog is feeling nauseous, their salivary glands can go into overdrive causing drooling to begin.

#### Physical Formation

Because the anatomy of their mouths allows the liquid to dribble out, some dogs' saliva production appears excessive. Giant breeds are known for their saggy lips and drooping jowls, which do not effectively hold saliva in and allow it to drain. Drooling breeds include the Bloodhound, Mastiff, St. Bernard, and Newfoundlanders.

#### Dental Problems

Even though saliva protects the teeth, dogs can develop dental problems. Tartar accumulation traps bacteria and causes gingivitis and periodontitis. Gums that are inflamed or infected become sore, and teeth become loose in their sockets as bony tissue deteriorates. Teeth may fall out or fracture, causing pain. All of these dental issues cause excessive salivation. Book a [dental examination](/site/veterinary-services-east-bay/dentistry "Dog Dental Exam, Berkeley Vet") for your dog if you think that oral health issues could be the cause of your dog's drooling..

#### Injuries and/or Growths

Excessive drooling can be caused by abrasions from chewing hard objects, ulcers, cuts, and burns. Drooling can also be caused by lumps or bumps in the mouth. These growths could be harmless warts or cancerous tumors. Even innocuous growths can cause drooling.

#### Ingestion of Toxins

If your dog has consumed something poisonous they may begin to drool heavily. Other signs of poisoning in dogs include agitation or distress, tremors, convulsions, vomiting, seizures, nosebleeds and staggering. If you think your dog may have consumed something poisonous contact your vet immediately or reach out to [your nearest animal emergency hospital](/site/emergency-veterinary-care-east-bay "Contact Berkeley After-Hours Emergency Animal Hospital").

#### Excitement

When dogs are excited or agitated, they drool. That's why they seem to love slobbering all over you!

### Is my dog's drooling normal?

It is important to note that while drooling can be a normal behavior, it can also be a sign of an underlying problem. If any of the following symptoms accompany your dog's drooling it's important to make a vet appointment as soon as possible.

#### Decreased Appetite or a Change in Eating Routine: 

If your pup's excessive drooling is caused by, the dog may lose appetite gradually. Drooling may be temporary if the cause is nausea, and will stop when the upset stomach resolves. Drooling caused by a mouth injury, growth, or foreign body will continue until the physical condition heals or the offending item/growth is removed. 

Dogs that love dry kibble may hesitate to eat when their mouths are sore. They may hold their heads at an odd angle in an attempt to position the food on the less painful side and may drop food from their mouths. They often eat better when served soft, moistened food.

#### Changing Behavior

Pain and discomfort often cause drooling but can also alter your dog's personality. Some dogs in pain will transform from sweet and passive pups to edgy and aggressive grumps. Outgoing and cheery dogs may become reclusive and withdrawn. Did your dog's personality change when the drooling started?

#### Pawing at the Face

Some dogs with oral pain will rub their muzzles on the floor or paw at their mouth to try and relieve the pain. When swallowing food or water, drooling dogs with esophageal or stomach problems may gulp or extend their necks.

### How to Stop a Dog from Drooling

There are many different approaches depending on the cause of your dog's drooling, including emergency veterinary care, teeth cleaning or extractions, treating any existing GI problems, avoiding irritants, healing injuries, and giving nausea medication before traveling. 

If the problem is behavioral, try calming your dog before allowing guests into the house, or place the dog in a quiet area while you entertain visitors. Prepare for drooling when cooking dinner by keeping a towel nearby to mop up the deluge.

If your dog's excessive drooling is due to their mouth shape, try tying a trendy bandanna loosely around your dog's neck to catch the slobber. After all, all those flapping jaws give your dog character, right?

### When Drooling Comes Naturally to Your Dog

Some dogs are naturally more drooly than others. Drooling may simply be part of your pup's unique personality. While managing excessive drooling is important, you may need to embrace your furry friends' slobbery quirk and love them just the way they are! After all, your dog's comfort and happiness are what truly matter. Loving your dog in spite of - or even because of - their persistent drooling is just another joyful twist in the journey of becoming a great pet parent.
