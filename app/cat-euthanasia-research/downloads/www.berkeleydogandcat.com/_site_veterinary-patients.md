A member of our vet team will walk through your pet's medical history and discuss any health issues they might be experiencing with you. If you have any questions, we will make sure to take the time and answer them.

Examination, Diagnosis & Treatment

Once your pet has been assessed, we will provide you with our diagnosis and the available treatment options for your pet's condition. Your vet will work with you to determine a treatment plan for your pet that works for both of you.

After your visit, we will create a detailed report of our diagnosis, the discussion we had with you, and your pet's treatment plan. We will keep this information on hand for whenever you need it.

If we are not your primary care veterinary hospital, we will keep them updated with your pet's medical history as well to make sure that they receive care that meets their needs from all vets involved.

2\. For all clients, failure to cancel an appointment without giving us 24 hours' notice or no-showing for your appointment will result in being charged for the missed appointment.

3\. For your convenience, we will call to remind you of your appointment 2 days in advance. If you are unable to keep your appointment please call our office at least 24 hours prior. This will allow us to have appointment slots available for our patients with emergencies.
