## Dr. Celia Olson

Dr. Celia Olson has connections to Berkeley that go back a few generations. She was born and raised here and received her undergraduate degree in Biology from Stanford University. After moving to Seattle and living there for a few years, she decided to pursue her dream of caring for animals and attended Washington State University School of Veterinary Medicine. While there, she took up Three Day Eventing, an equestrian sport, and after graduating, she returned to the Santa Clara Valley of California and worked at a mixed animal practice, specializing in dog and cat medicine and surgery, horses, and ranch animals.

Since moving back to the Bay Area in 2006, she has been exclusively a general practitioner for dogs and cats. Her special interests are in neurology, dermatology, geriatrics, and dentistry. Over the years, she has gone to assisted living facilities caring for the pets of elderly people, and has also helped to set up and staff a vet clinic in rural Nevada, which served the needs of the small communities in that area.

In November, 2022, Dr. Olson joined Berkeley Dog and Cat Hospital. When not at work, she enjoys hiking, backpacking, gardening and spending time with her family and "Buddy", a wonderful big "adventure" dog adopted by one of her sons while he was helping out at the clinic in Nevada.
