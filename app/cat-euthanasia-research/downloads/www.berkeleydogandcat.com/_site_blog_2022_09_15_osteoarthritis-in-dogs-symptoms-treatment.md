# Osteoarthritis in Dogs - Causes, Symptoms & Treatments

Osteoarthritis is a progressive, degenerative condition in dogs that gradually becomes more severe. While there's no cure for this painful condition, your Berkeley vet can provide treatments to help manage symptoms and allow your dog to enjoy a good quality of life.

## What is Osteoarthritis in Dogs?

Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis in dogs and is a degenerative joint disorder that leads to a permanent deterioration of the cartilage that provides cushioning for the joints. This painful condition is estimated to affect about a quarter of all dogs throughout their lifetime.

### Does Your Dog Have Osteoarthritis?

The painful joints caused by osteoarthritis can lead to a number of tell-tale signs. The main symptoms of osteoarthritis in dogs that you may notice include:

  * Pain, stiffness, and lameness
  * Swollen joints
  * Refusal to jump, use stairs, or run
  * Reluctance to stand 
  * Restlessness



  * Lack of enthusiasm for walks or play
  * Unusual aggression, whining, or irritability
  * Licking at joints
  * Slow shuffling walk



### What causes dogs to develop osteoarthritis?

Although this condition can develop in any breed of dog, it is most often seen in larger breeds such as German Shepherds, Golden Retrievers, Labs, Rottweilers, and giant breeds. 

The actual cause of osteoarthritis is largely unknown but this condition is often associated with underlying issues such as an injury due to trauma, hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, cruciate injury, or dislocations of the shoulder or knee.

Obesity also appears to play a role in dogs developing osteoarthritis. Excess weight can put unnecessary stress on the dog's joints leading to pain, and degenerative joint issues over time.

### What treatments can be provided to manage my dog's osteoarthritis symptoms?

Osteoarthritis in dogs cannot be reversed or cured. Successful treatment of this condition is aimed at reducing your dog's pain, and helping to slow the ongoing degeneration of the affected joints - allowing your dog to live more comfortably, and enjoy a good quality of life as they continue to age.

Often a number of treatments will be used together to achieve pain relief and more comfortable mobility.

#### Painkillers / Pain Meds

Painkillers such as anti-inflammatories are often prescribed as a long-term treatment for managing your dog’s joint pain and helping to reduce swelling. 

#### Exercise

Although it may seem counterintuitive exercise is essential for dogs with osteoarthritis. It may be necessary to cut back on exercise when your dog is first diagnosed with osteoarthritis however staying mobile will help your dog to maintain fitness, achieve a healthy weight, relieve joint pain and enjoy a good quality of life.

Exercise will need to be tailored to your dog's overall health and severity of osteoarthritis. Your vet will be sure to recommend the best level of exercise to help relieve your dog's osteoarthritis symptoms.

#### Diet

Managing your dog's weight will be a key element of their treatment for osteoarthritis. Increased weight puts increased stress on your dog's joints so keeping weight at a healthy level will help to minimize the pain caused by the condition.

Your vet may recommend putting your dog on a calorie-reduced diet if their exercise level has been reduced, or a diet supplemented with chondroitin sulfate, glucosamine sulfate and omega-3 fatty acids as a way to combat symptoms. 

#### Physical Rehabilitation (Physio for Dogs)

Physical rehabilitation is the name for physiotherapy for dogs and can include a number of treatments that are designed to help reduce pain while strengthening and improving muscle tone, maintaining range of motion and working to improve overall endurance.

Physiotherapy for dogs with osteoarthritis may include one or more of the following treatments: therapeutic exercises, therapeutic ultrasound, cold laser therapy, regenerative therapy, neuromuscular electrical stimulation, underwater treadmill or pool therapy, and massage, combined with conventional treatments such as anti-inflammatory medications. 

Ask your vet if there is a qualified Canine Physical Rehabilitation practitioner in your area

#### Surgery

In some cases when joint damage is severe your vet may recommend surgery to help alleviate symptoms and slow the progression of your dog's osteoarthritis. Surgery may be performed to remove bone fragments that are aggravating the condition or to replace the affected joints. 

### What is the prognosis for dogs with osteoarthritis?

With effective long-term pain management and a little additional care, your dog may be able to enjoy a long and happy life even with osteoarthritis. Speak to your vet to learn more about managing your pup's joint pain, and how you can help your dog to enjoy a happy life for many years to come.
