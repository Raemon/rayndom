# What You Need to Know About Getting a Cat Fixed

Spaying or neutering your cat comes with a variety of benefits. In today's post, you will find information about when to get your cat or kitten fixed, and the benefits of spaying or neutering.

## When should I spay or neuter my cat?

Kittens can be spayed or neutered as young as six to eight weeks of age, however standard spay and neuter surgeries are most often performed when the kitten is between five and six months old. That said, provided your cat is healthy, these procedures can be performed at any age.

### Spaying VS Neutering

Neutering is the sterilization of male animals. This is done by surgically removing the animal's testes. Spaying is the sterilization of female animals. Females are sterilized by removing the uterus and ovaries. 

### Benefits of Spaying or Neutering Your Cat

Female cats spayed before their first heat have a reduced risk for malignant mammary tumors later in life.

Spayed cats are also protected against common, serious infections of the uterus and various cancers of the reproductive organs.

Many undesirable behaviors in female cats can be reduced with spaying, including; increased and overly intense affection, intense rubbing on objects, marking territory with urine, the desire to wander and heat-induced howling.

Neutering male cats also offers a number of benefits. Neutered cats typically show a reduction in problematic behaviors such as territory marking (spraying), cat aggression and roaming which may reduce your cat's risk of injury.

Your male cat's risk of developing testicular and prostate cancer is also reduced with neutering.

Cat overpopulation is a serious problem across North America. Spaying and neutering help reduce the number of homeless cats living in shelters and out on the streets. Unfortunately, many of these cats never find their forever home and are euthanized. By spaying or neutering your cat you are helping to reduce the rates of cat homelessness and euthanization in your area.
