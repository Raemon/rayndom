## Vet Laboratory & Diagnostics

We use electromagnetic radiation as well as other technologies in order to conduct our diagnostic testing. This lets us create very detailed images of the inside of your pet's body. 

At Berkeley Dog & Cat Hospital, we use the advanced technology in our in-house lab to diagnose your pet's medical issues. We offer a wide range of services, including EKG, radiology, ultrasound and surgical lasers. 

Using our diagnostic technology, we can quickly and efficiently create information about your pet's condition that we can use to inform you and create a treatment plan for your beloved companion. 

### In-House Lab & Pharmacy

Using our in-house **veterinary lab** , we are able to perform tests and get results quickly and efficiently. This means we can diagnose your pet's symptoms and begin treatment as soon as possible. We have a fully-stocked **vet pharmacy** as well, offering all of the prescription medication and dietary products your pet could need. 

### Our Diagnostic Services 

We are proud to offer a wide range of advanced diagnostic tools and tests which let our vets provide you with an accurate diagnosis for your pet as soon as possible.

  * Radiography (Digital X-Rays)

Using a radiograph (also known as a digital x-ray), we can examine the inside of your pet's body to discover information which isn't visible on the outside. 

Radiography is safe, non-invasive, and painless for your pet. It only uses very low doses of radiation, making it safe for pregnant female pets as well as very young pets.

Radiographs can be used to check for a number of conditions, including broken bones, arthritis, some tumors, bladder stones and spinal cord issues. We also use radiographs as part of our dental care services to provide information about your pet's teeth and oral health.

  * Ultrasound

Ultrasound imaging uses high-frequency soundwaves to produce images of the inside of your pet's body in real-time. 

Because we're able to produce these images in real-time, we can see how your pet's organs and internal structures move, as well as how well their blood is flowing through their vessels. 

  * ECG

We use cutting-edge equipment to conduct ECG (or electrocardiogram) tests. These allow us to measure your pet's heartrate in real time. 

We can use this technology to detect abnormal heart activity, previous heart attacks and heart disease. 

  * Endoscopy

An endoscopy uses a small camera and light attached to the end of a flexible to tube to observe in side of your pet's body. This tube is inserted into the body so we can observe tissues and organs.

Endoscopes aren't very invasive and can be inserted into openings like your pet's mouth to detect internal ulcers, blockages, trauma, abscesses, some kinds of cancer and more

  * CT Scans (Computed Tomography)

This no-invasive scanner lets us view your pet's internal organs by creating very detailed cross-sections of their body.

We typically use CT scans for planning surgery, diagnosing diseases and early detection and treatment of cancer. 

  * Surgical Lasers

During surgery, we are able to use a highly focused laser beam to vaporize living tissue. This allows us to seal nerve endings, blood vessels, capillaries and lymphatics. 

Surgical lasers offer significant benefits to our patients. They help reduce swelling, pain and bleeding and encourage a faster recovery from a procedure.

##### Happy Tails from Clients

  * Dr. Kelman was wonderful with our Saint Berdoodle. She performed a spay and gastropexy so we were very nervous! She ensured we understood everything prior to moving forward.
