# Your Guide to Dental Disease in Dogs

Healthy teeth and gums play an essential role in your dog's overall health and well-being. Nonetheless, many dogs don't get the dental care they need to maintain good oral health. Today, we discuss some common dog dental problems seen by our Berkeley vets.

### Dog Dental Problems

A clean and healthy mouth is essential to your dog's overall well-being, but most dogs don't receive the dental health care they need to keep their teeth and gums healthy.

The truth is that our Berkeley vets see dogs as young as 3 years old developing signs of periodontal disease (gum disease) or other dental issues. Developing dental disease at such a young age can have serious negative consequences for the dog's long-term health. 

An effective way to ensure that your dog maintains good oral health is to combine routine at-home dental care with an [annual professional dental exam](/site/veterinary-services-east-bay/dentistry "annual professional dental exam"). 

### Signs That Your Dog May Have Dental Issues

Spotting the early signs of dental diseases in dogs can be tricky. Nonetheless, if you notice that your dog is exhibiting any of the following symptoms it's time to contact your vet to book a dental exam for your pup:

  * Extra teeth or retained baby teeth
  * Bleeding around the mouth
  * Swelling or pain in or around the mouth
  * Plaque or tartar buildup on teeth
  * Excess drooling or blood in drool 



  * Discolored teeth
  * Loose or broken teeth
  * Bad breath
  * Dropping food
  * Chewing on one side



### Common Oral Health Issues Seen In Dogs

There are countless dental health problems that could affect your dog's oral health, but the 4 most common dog dental conditions that our vets see are: 

#### Periodontal Disease 

Periodontal disease, commonly known as gum disease, is a condition that occurs when there is an excessive amount of plaque buildup on your pup's teeth. If plaque (a thin, sticky film of bacteria) isn't regularly removed, it can harden into a substance called calculus or tartar that becomes more difficult to remove. 

Tartar buildup causes pockets to form between your dog's teeth and gum line where infection can develop. If gum disease isn't treated eventually your dog's teeth can become loose and fall out.

#### Oral Infections 

With periodontal disease, the open space around the tooth roots can become filled with bacteria, leading to an infection. This infection can cause a good deal of pain for your dog and can result in a tooth root abscess. 

Besides the negative oral health impacts a tooth infection has, it can also negatively affect your dog's overall body health. Just as in humans, there have been links found between periodontal disease and heart disease in dogs. This is due to bacteria entering the bloodstream from the mouth, damaging heart function, and causing issues with other organs. These health issues are in addition to the more obvious problem of pain caused by eroded gums, and missing or damaged teeth.

#### Tooth Fractures 

We all know dogs love to chew! However, as a pet parent, you should be aware that chewing on certain items, such as bones or very hard plastic can cause your pup's teeth to fracture or break. Tooth fractures are also more likely when your dog is chewing on an object that is too big for their mouth. 

When selecting chew toys be sure to pick something that is an appropriate size and material for your dog. Speak to your vet about what they would recommend. 

#### Retained Baby Teeth 

As with human babies, puppies have a set of primary teeth that fall out when your puppy is about 6 months of age. That said, sometimes not all of the dog's primary teeth fall out the way they should, but instead remain in place. This can cause overcrowding which can result in extra plaque build up and make it more difficult to keep your pup's mouth clean.

Many vets recommend that these teeth be removed under anesthetic in order to prevent future issues. This can often be done when the dog is already under anesthesia for their spay or neuter surgery.
