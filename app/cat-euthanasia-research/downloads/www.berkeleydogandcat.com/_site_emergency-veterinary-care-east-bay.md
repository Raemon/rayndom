We are not able to predict which cases we will see and when they will arrive, but we will prioritize cases based on medical need. 

You'll find a comfortable area for waiting, and we will do our best to keep you updated about wait times and the status of your pet.

  * Will you keep in touch with our primary care veterinarian?

We will keep your primary care vet updated with your pet's medical history and files to ensure your pet receives seamless, integrated care.
