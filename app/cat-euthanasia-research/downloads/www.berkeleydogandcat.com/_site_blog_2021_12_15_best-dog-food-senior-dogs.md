# Best Dog Food For Senior Dogs

[](//d2zp5xs5cp8zlg.cloudfront.net/image-48806-800.jpg)

As our canine companions age their nutritional needs change, but reading through countless labels to find the best food for your dog is overwhelming. That's why we recommend you speak to your vet about the best food for your older dog. In the meantime, here are a few tips on feeding your senior dog from our Berkeley vets. 

[](https://www.addtoany.com/share)

### Is my dog considered senior?

The age at which a dog is considered elderly or geriatric can vary depending on breed and size. Generally, small dogs have a life expectancy of 15-20 years, while larger dogs usually live between 12-15 years. 

As bigger dogs age faster, they are considered to be "older" around the time they turn 6, while small dogs generally pass into middle age at around 8 years of age. 

### Do older dogs really need different food?

Yes, there are two major things to consider when determining the best dog food for senior dogs. 

The first thing to be aware of is caloric intake. Just like with people, a dog's metabolism slows down as they age, and gaining extra weight becomes easier. This means pet owners must ensure their dog receives the correct amount of nutrients and protein to thrive without intaking too many calories. 

The second consideration is trying to make sure their diet includes high-fiber options. Constipation is painful and it can lead to further gastrointestinal issues when it becomes severe enough. Maintaining gastrointestinal health is a common obstacle for older dogs, so the best dog food for senior dogs will have lots of fiber to help them stay healthy and regular. 

### Will special food help my senior dog with their health issues?

In some cases, specialized diets will be prescribed by your vet to help your senior dog with their health issues. There are foods tailored to help a range of issues, from kidney and liver health to urinary tract and digestive conditions. 

Even if your older dog doesn't have specific health issues, it is a good idea to switch them to dog food geared towards senior dogs to help preserve their wellbeing. Talk to your vet about what the best option is for your dog. 

### What if my older dog won't eat the new food?

It is relatively normal for older dogs to have some loss of appetite. If your senior dog has suddenly begun to demonstrate an unexplained loss of appetite, it is best to [speak with your vet](/site/contact-animal-hospital-east-bay-vet "Contact Berkeley Vets") and have them rule out any potentially serious causes including dental disease, diabetes, kidney disease, or cancer.

Once serious medical conditions have been ruled out as the cause for appetite loss, another avenue for consideration is the simplest one—perhaps your dog is tired of their regular food. You can try adding things like chicken broth, cooked chicken (unseasoned), or a small amount of canned food to your dog's dry kibble to make it more enticing.

### Best Dog Food for Senior Dogs

Below are a few of the dog foods and supplements the vets at Berkeley Dog & Cat Hospital recommend for senior dogs, all of which are available from our [online store and pharmacy.](/site/pet-shop-pharmacy-east-bay "Shop Online Berkeley Vets") Ask your vet about the best dog food for older dogs.
