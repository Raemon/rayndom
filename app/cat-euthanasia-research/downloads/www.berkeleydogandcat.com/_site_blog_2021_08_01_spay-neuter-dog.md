# A Pet Parents Guide to Getting Your Dog Fixed

[ ](//d2zp5xs5cp8zlg.cloudfront.net/image-42671-800.jpg)

New dog owners often ask our Berkeley vets if they should get their dog neutered or spayed. So today we share some great reasons why you should consider getting your puppy fixed.

[](https://www.addtoany.com/share)

## Should you get your dog fixed?

According to the ASPCA (American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals), approximately 3.3 million dogs enter shelters every year across the USA.

Spaying or neutering your dog is the best way for you to help reduce the overall number of unplanned puppies each year while improving your pet's behavior and reducing their risk of some serious health conditions.

### What is the difference between spaying and neutering?

To begin, it's important to understand what 'fixing your dog' actually means. 'Fixing' is the general term we use when talking about spaying or neutering a dog. 

#### Spaying Female Dogs

Spaying entails the removal of a female dog's reproductive organs through either an ovariohysterectomy (both uterus and ovaries are removed) or an ovariectomy (only the ovaries are removed). After your female dog has been spayed she will not be able to have puppies.

#### Neutering Male Dogs

For male dogs, neutering, or castration, involves the removal of both testicles and their associated structures. A neutered dog is unable to reproduce.

### Are there any benefits to having my dog spayed or neutered?

Besides reducing the risk of unwanted puppies, there are a number of other benefits to spaying or neutering your dog.

#### Neutered Dog

Having your male dog neutered will protect your dog from developing testicular cancer and can also help reduce unwanted behaviors such as aggression, straying and humping. 

#### Spayed Dog

Getting your female dog spayed can help to prevent serious health problems such as pyometra, (a potentially life-threatening uterine infection), and mammary cancer.

### When should I get my dog fixed?

There are a number of factors that can influence the timing of these procedures. That said [spaying and neutering](/site/veterinary-surgery-east-bay "spaying and neutering") can be done on puppies as young as a few months old. Traditionally, puppies were fixed when they were between 4 - 6 months old.

Speak to your vet in order to determine the best age to spay or neuter your dog.
