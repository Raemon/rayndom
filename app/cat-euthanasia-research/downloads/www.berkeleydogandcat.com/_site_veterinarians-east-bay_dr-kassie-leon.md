## Dr. Kassie Leon

Dr. Kassie Leon is originally from the east coast. She was born and raised in Florida where she received her undergraduate degree from University of Florida. Shortly after, she moved to the Caribbean and attended veterinary school at St. George’s University in Grenada, finishing her clinics at North Carolina State University. Last year, she moved to the bay area and completed an internship in emergency medicine and fell in love with the beautiful state of California. Her special interests include internal medicine and surgery, as well as emergency and critical care. All patients receive the best cuddles from her as well. She is looking forward to providing your beloved pets the best care possible.

Outside of work, Dr. Kassie enjoys reading while sipping wine, spending time with family and friends, and exploring the outdoors. She will happily take any recommendations for the city anytime.

##### Happy Tails from Clients

  * Very professional vets who have resolved every problem that our somewhat stubborn Corgi has gotten herself into. The techs are very caring, and clearly gifted with animals, so the overall experience is low-stress.
