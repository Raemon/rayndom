# Microchips for Indoor & Outdoor Cats - Are They Worth It?

It's heartbreaking to think of your cat out in the world alone, but our feline friends are masters of escape. Getting your cat microchipped provides your kitty with a permanent form of ID that can help ensure you are reunited if they become lost or stolen. Read on to learn more about this valuable service.

## The Microchipping Process for Cats

Microchips are tiny radio-frequency identification (RFID) chips that can help vets and animal shelters locate pet parents if their dog or cat has been found. Microchips are about the size of a grain of rice and are typically placed under the skin, between the cat's shoulder blades.

Microchipping your cat does not require surgery. The chip is implanted just under the skin using a needle. The process involves very little discomfort. Most cats have almost no reaction to having the microchip implanted.

Once your cat's microchip has been implanted, you simply register the chip's serial number and your cat's information with the company that produced the chip. By matching your cat's information with the serial number of the microchip, if your cat is found, they can be traced back to you.

### Microchip VS Identity Tag

When it comes to returning lost cats to their owners, collars and tags are certainly useful tools. Anyone finding your kitty can just read the tag, and call the phone number listed on it to contact you. Outdoor cats should always have collars and identification tags in case they get into trouble. Be sure to include your name and contact number on your cat's tag. Identification tags are equally good for indoor cats since cats often manage to sneak out when owners aren't looking. 

Nonetheless, as good as it is to equip your cat with a collar and identification tag, tags can fall off and get lost, leaving your cat with no identifying information. Microchips are a permanent way to provide your cat with a means of identification.

NOTE: It is important to keep your microchip registration information up to date. Be sure to contact the microchip company to update your information if you move or change your contact number. 

### Benefits of Microchipping a Cat

If your cat has been found, the vet or rescue organization will use a special scanner to read the microchip. Microchip scanners are universal and can read all modern chips, regardless of their brand. When the scanner is passed over the cat's back and sides, the microchip will transmit its unique identification number to the scanner.

The rescuer will then contact the national database to find out your phone number so that you can be notified that your kitty has been found.

If your cat is stolen, microchips can be very helpful as a way of proving ownership.
