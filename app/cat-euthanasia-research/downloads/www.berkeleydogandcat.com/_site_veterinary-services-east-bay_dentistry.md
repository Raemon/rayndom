## Comprehensive Dental Care for Cats & Dogs

Routine dental care is a key part of your cat or dog's oral health. However, many cats and dogs don't actually get the oral hygiene care they require to keep their mouths healthy. 

At our veterinary hospital serving Berkeley and the Berkeley, we provide complete dental care for your pet ranging from checkups to cleanings, x-rays and surgeries. 

We are also passionate about dental health education about home dental care for pet owners. 

### Dental Surgery in Berkeley

We know that finding out your pet needs surgery can be anxiety-inducing. Because of this, we work to make the process as free of stress as possible for you and your pet. 

We will do everything we can to make sure that your pet has the best experience possible with us. We will walk you through each step of the process with you before the procedure, as well as how to prepare your pet and provide care for them as they heal.

We offer jaw fracture repair surgeries, tooth extractions and gum disease treatment for dogs and cats.

### Pet Teeth Cleaning & Exams

Your pet should come in for a dental checkup at least once per year. Pets who are prone to dental problems may need to come in more often than that though. 

Berkeley Dog & Cat Hospital can assess, diagnose and treat dental health problems in cats and dogs. 

  * Symptoms

If you notice any of these symptoms in your pet, it's probably time to bring them in for a dental checkup.

    * Discolored teeth 
    * Tartar buildup
    * Bad breath 
    * Pain or swelling in or around the mouth
    * Reduced appetite or refusal to eat
    * Loose and/or broken teeth
    * Extra teeth or retained baby teeth
    * Bleeding from the mouth
    * Abnormal chewing, drooling, or dropping food from the mouth 
[Contact Us to Book a Dental Checkup](/site/contact-animal-hospital-east-bay-vet)

  * Assessment

We will conduct a thorough physical assessment of your pet before we begin the dental exam.

We will take blood and urine analyses to ensure it's safe to administer anesthesia. Additional [diagnostic](/site/veterinary-lab-east-bay "Veterinary Laboratory & Diagnostics, Berkeley Vets") tests, such as chest radiographs or an ECG may also be conducted. 

Once your pet is under anesthesia, we will conduct a complete oral examination (tooth by tooth) and charting. 

  * Treatment

After that, we will clean and polish your pet's teeth above and below their gum line and take x-rays. We will then treat eachg of their teeth with fluoride. 

The final step is to apply a dental sealant to prevent plaque from attaching to the enamel. If advanced periodontal disease is found, the veterinarian will develop a treatment plan and discuss it with you. 

  * Prevention

We will schedule a complementary follow-up examination in the two weeks after our initial appointment. 

During this follow-up visit, we will speak with you about what you can do for at-home dental care, including brushing daily as well as products which can promote your pet's oral health.




### FAQs About Pet Dental Care

Here are some of the most frequently asked questions from our patients about pet dental care.

  * Why do pets need their teeth cleaned?

Pets can develop periodontal diseases, tooth decay and other results of poor oral health just like people.

Just like in humans, when animals eat, plaque sticks to their teeth and can build up into tartar if not brushed away regularly. 

This can lead to infections in the mouth, periodontal disease, tooth decay, and even loose or missing teeth. That's why regular dental care is essential to preventing pain or disease in the gums.

  * How can I tell if my pet has oral hygiene issues?

Did you know that your pet's behavior can be a good indicator of their oral health? If your pet is having oral health issues, they might drool excessively, paw at their mouth or teeth, grind their teeth, stop grooming regularly or yawn excessively. 

Other signs of oral health problems include bad breath, swollen gums, and tooth discoloration. Some pets may even suffer from pain that keeps them from eating. Read more about symptoms to the left under Pet Teeth Cleaning & Exams. 

  * What long-term problems can poor oral health potentially cause in my pet?

Besides causing problems ranging from cavities and bad breath to severe periodontal disease, oral health issues and conditions can lead to disease in the liver, kidney, heart and other areas throughout your pet's body. 

Your pet may develop tumors or cysts or just generally feel ill. You may be able to relate if you've ever had a toothache! As well, diseases which are related to poor oral health can shorten your pet's lifespan and cause them significant pain. 

This is why regular dental care is so essential to animals' physical health and wellbeing. 

  * What happens during a pet teeth cleaning appointment?

During your pet’s regular oral exam, the vet will examine his or her mouth and look for oral health conditions or any symptoms needing treatment.

The vet will clean tartar and other debris from your cat's or dog's teeth. If cavities, gingivitis or other conditions need to be addressed, the vet will explain these to you and provide advice on which actions you should take. 

In some cases, surgery will be needed to treat serious conditions. Your pet will be provided anesthesia before their dental procedure to ensure they are comfortable and do not experience any pain. However, special care will be needed post-surgery. 

If you notice any of these symptoms, schedule a dental appointment with us. 

  * What should I do at home to keep my pet’s teeth clean between dental appointments?

At home, you should brush your pet's teeth on a regular basis and give them dental chew toys. These will help eliminate plaque. 

Do not allow them to chew on things that will damage their teeth, such as bones, toys or objects that are too hard. Always contact your vet with any questions or concerns regarding your pet's oral health. 




### Veterinary Dentistry: Anesthesia & Your Pet's Oral Health

Cats and dogs do not understand what is going on during dental procedures, and will often react to dental procedures by struggling or biting. We provide anesthesia to all of our patients before performing dental procedures. This puts less stress on the animals and allows us to x-ray their mouth as needed.
