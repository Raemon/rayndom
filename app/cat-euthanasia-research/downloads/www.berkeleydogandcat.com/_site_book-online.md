## What to Expect at an Appointment

Throughout your time at Berkeley Dog & Cat Hospital, you and your pet will be treated gently, kindly, and with empathy. Our goal is to ensure the best possible care for every patient and in office experience for every pet parent.

### Get Settled

Please come about 10 minutes early to complete our New Patient Form. We will work to bring your pet into the exam room as quickly as possible. We do this to minimize time spent around animals that are unfamiliar to your pet.

### Meet Your Veterinarian

A member of our team will review your pet's history and discuss their issues with you. We'll take time to address any questions or concerns you may have.

### Examination, Diagnosis & Treatment

Once your pet has been examined by a vet, we will provide a diagnosis and treatment options as needed. Your veterinarian will work with you to determine a treatment plan for your pet.

Following your visit, we will send you a detailed report of our diagnosis, a summary of our discussion, and your pet's treatment plan. This information will also be kept on hand at our hospital whenever you need it.
