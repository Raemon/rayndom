# Cat Vaccination Schedule (Kittens Too!)

Vaccinations play a key role in helping your feline family member to live a long and healthy life, but what vaccines need to be given and when? Find out below.

[](https://www.addtoany.com/share)

## The Importance of Cat Vaccines for Feline Health

To protect your kitten's health against serious feline-specific diseases, it is essential to have your [kitten vaccinated](/site/veterinary-services-east-bay/cat-dog-vaccinations-parasite-prevention "Kitten Vaccines, Berkeley Vet"). After your kitten's first vaccinations, follow up with regular booster shots throughout your cat's lifetime to help maintain immunity. 

Booster shots 'boost' your cat's protection against a range of feline diseases, as the effectiveness of the initial vaccine wears off. Booster shots for different vaccines are given on varying schedules. Your vet will let you know when to bring your cat back their booster shots.

### Types of Vaccines For Cats

Vaccinations for cats fall into two basic types core vaccines and non-core vaccines (also called lifestyle vaccinations).

**Core vaccinations** are recommended for all cats. These vaccinations are considered vital for protecting your cat from the following common and serious feline conditions: 

  * Panleukopenia (feline distemper)
  * Feline calicivirus (FCV)
  * Feline herpesvirus type I (FHV, FHV-1)
  * Rabies



**Lifestyle vaccinations (also called non-core vaccinations)** are the vaccines that are suitable for some cats, based on their lifestyle. Your vet will let you know which lifestyle vaccines are recommended for your feline friend. Lifestyle vaccines include protection against:

  * Feline leukemia virus (FeLV)
  * Bordetella
  * Chlamydophila felis
  * Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)



### Outdoor & Indoor Kitten Vaccination Schedule

At about six to eight weeks old your kitten should see the veterinarian for a [full examination](/site/veterinary-services-east-bay/cat-dog-routine-exams#kittenpuppy "Kitten & Puppy Examinations, Berkeley Veterinarian") and their first round of vaccinations. After that, they should receive a series of vaccines at three or four-week intervals until they are about 16 weeks old.

  * 6 to 8 weeks

    * Rhinotracheitis, Calcivirus, Panleukopenia, Chlamydia

  * 10 to 12 weeks

    * Booster: Rhinotracheitis, Calcivirus, Panleukopenia, Chlamydia
    * Feline Leukemia

  * 14 to 16 Weeks

    * Rabies
    * Booster: Rhinotracheitis, Calcivirus, Panleukopenia, Chlamydia
    * Feline Leukemia 2

  * 5 to 6 months

While the following are not kitten vaccinations, spaying, neutering, and microchipping help protect your cat from a number of health issues, and therefore fall under the preventive health care umbrella. 

    * **Spay (females) -** Spaying your female cat prevents the birth of unwanted litters of kittens, protects your cat against serious illnesses, and can help to prevent behaviors such as howling and scooting that accompany heat cycles.
    * **Neuter (males) -** Neutering your male cat prevents your pet from fathering unwanted kittens, protects your cat against various illnesses, and can help to prevent territory marking (spraying), roaming, howling, and cat aggression. 
    * **Microchipping -** A microchip is a permanent form of identification that is about the size of a grain of rice and placed under your pet’s skin. Pets that are microchipped have a better chance of being reunited with their owners if they are lost.




### When To Get Your Adult Cat's Booster Shots

Adult cats should receive booster shots yearly or every three years depending on the vaccine. Your vet will advise you on when you bring your adult cat back for their booster shots.

### When Does Vaccine Protection Begin Working

Your kitten is not fully vaccinated until they have received all of their injections, at about 12-16 weeks of age. Once they have received all of those initial vaccinations your kitten will be protected against the diseases covered by the vaccines. 

If you want to allow your kitten outdoors before they have received all of their vaccines, it is a good idea to keep them confined to low risk areas such as your own backyard.

### Why Indoor Cats Need Vaccines Too

You may not think that your indoor cat needs to be vaccinated, however many states including Tennessee require that cats over the age of 6 months be vaccinated against rabies. When you have your cat vaccinated your vet will provide you with a certificate of vaccination which you should store in a safe place.

When it comes to your cat's health it's always better to err on the side of caution. Cats can be curious creatures. Our vets recommend that indoor cats receive all of the core vaccinations to protect against diseases they may be exposed to if they manage to escape the safety of home.

  * Dr. Kelman was wonderful with our Saint Berdoodle. She performed a spay and gastropexy so we were very nervous! She ensured we understood everything prior to moving forward.
