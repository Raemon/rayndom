## Veterinary Surgery

Our staff and boarded surgeons offer a wide range of surgical care for Berkeley pets at Berkeley Dog & Cat Hospital, using advanced surgical techniques and carefully following safety protocols. 

During each surgery we conduct, a dedicated nurse will administer anesthesia to your pet and continuously monitor them using advanced patient monitoring equipment. We will also provide your pet with pain management care. 

We will always provide your with post-operative instructions and pain management once a surgery is complete. Your vet will walk you through your at-home care instructions and answer any questions you may have.

### What to Expect from Surgery

We will always keep you fully informed not only of what is involved in a surgery we will be conducting on your beloved pet, but also the exact reason that your vet believes it to be the best treatment option. We will be sure to walk you carefully through any post-operative care you will need to provide your companion once they are home, and we are careful to follow strict safety protocols all throughout a surgery.

### Surgical Procedures

Our vets at Berkeley Dog & Cat Hospital routinely perform the following elective and non-elective surgeries:

  * Amputation

Amputation of one of your pet's limbs helps to treat a useless or painful limb which has severe cancer, trauma, a birth defect, or damage which cannot be fixed. 

  * C-Sections

A Caesarean section is the surgical removal of babies from their mother's uterus. 

C-sections are often performed when the mother will not be able to safely give birth naturally. 

  * Dental Surgery

Our veterinarians provide [dental surgeries](/site/veterinary-services-east-bay/dentistry "Dentistry & Dental Surgery, Berkeley Vets") for dogs and cats. These surgeries range from gum disease treatments to tooth extractions and more.

  * Orthopedic Surgery

Orthopedic surgery corrects injuries and issues in your pet's bones, tendons, joints and ligaments as well as other skeletal structures. 

  * Soft Tissue Surgery

We offer soft tissue surgeries for pets suffering from nose, ear and throat issues. 

These procedures can also treat gastrointestinal, skin, oncological, urogenital and cardiothoracic disorders. 

  * Spaying & Neutering

Spaying and neutering is the surgical sterilization of your pet in order to prevent disease and unwanted pregnancies. 

  * Splenectomy

Splenectomies are surgeries in which the spleen is entirely or partially removed. A complete splenectomy is the most common form of this surgery. 

  * Tibial Plateau Levelling Osteotomy

Tibial Plateau Levelling Osteotomy (TPLO) is a surgery used to treat ruptures in dog's knee joints. It involves changing the angle of the tibia to stop shifting while walking.

  * Tibial Tuberosity Advancement

Tibial Tuberosity Advancement (TTA) is a surgery used to treat ruptures in the stifle (knee) joints of dogs. It involves moving and then stabilizing the bone around the knee.




### The Surgery Process

The idea of bringing your pet in for surgery can be an anxiety-inducing one. We want to assure you, however, that we only recommend surgery when it is in the best interests of your pet.

We will make surer that you understand why we have recommended surgical care for your pet and what the surgery will involve. We want to help you be informed and comfortable making the decision. 

#### Surgical protocols at our clinic include:

**Pre-surgical assessments.** We will confirm the specifics of the surgery with you, complete a physical exam of your pet and make sure that it will be safe to administer anesthesia to your pet.

**Dedicated surgical suites.** Surgeries are performed in a dedicated surgical suite. This is a room that is kept sterile and clean to avoid any cross-contamination.

**Surgical attire.** Our staff wear disposable caps and masks at all times when they are in the surgical suite. Staff members involved in the surgery will also wear single use gloves and sterile gowns.

**Sterile packs and equipment.** We carefully clean, sterilize and wrap our surgical instruments and equipment prior to every surgery.

### Post-Operative Care

After your pet has received surgical care, one of our vets will walk you through any post-operative care your pet will need once they are able to return home. We will walk you through any special care, medicine, or pain management your pet will require over the course of their recovery, so you can rest assured that your pet will be as comfortable as possible.

##### Happy Tails from Clients

  * Dr. Kelman was wonderful with our Saint Berdoodle. She performed a spay and gastropexy so we were very nervous! She ensured we understood everything prior to moving forward.
