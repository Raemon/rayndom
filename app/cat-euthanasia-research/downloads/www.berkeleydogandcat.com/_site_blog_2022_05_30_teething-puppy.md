# A Pet Parent's Guide to Puppy Teething

Teething can be a trying time for puppy owners. Pain caused by teething often leads our four-legged babies to chew on things they shouldn't - including favorite shoes or accessible toes. Today, our Berkeley vets share advice on how to help relieve your puppy's pain and survive this difficult stage.

### Why is my puppy biting me and chewing on everything?

Puppy teething can seem like a very long process if your fur baby is chewing on everything they can wrap their jaws around. But it's important to try and stay calm and remember that your pup isn't trying to be naughty, they are trying to relieve the pain and discomfort they are feeling. It just so happens that chewing on your new sofa's leg may be the perfect thing for making your pup's mouth feel better. 

### When will my dog's teeth fall out?

Breeds vary somewhat but puppies typically get their first set of teeth at about 5 - 6 weeks of age. At around 16 weeks old your puppy's baby teeth (deciduous teeth) will begin to fall out and their adult teeth will begin to appear.

### Are there any common dental problems in puppies that I should watch for?

Problems with puppies' first teeth are rare since they don't have them for long. However, some smaller breeds and brachycephalic (short-nosed) breeds, have an increased risk of not losing some of their deciduous teeth. This most often occurs with the upper canine teeth, but it can happen to any of your puppy's teeth.

Retained deciduous teeth can lead to overcrowding of the teeth, misalignments, bite problems and general discomfort. They are also believed to increase your dog's risk of future dental problems and gum disease. Most vets recommend that retained deciduous teeth be removed while your pet is under general anesthesia during their spay or neuter procedure.

### How long do puppies teethe?

By the time your pooch is about 6 - 7 months old, they should have all 42 of their adult teeth and teething should be a thing of the past. 

That said, those 4 - 5 months of intense teething can be a real struggle for many pet parents. As puppies looking to find relief from the pain will often chew on almost anything they can find, and because of their small stature that can often mean furniture legs, expensive footwear or even your feet or fingers. 

So what can you do to help relieve your furry friend's discomfort and protect your valuable belongings? Here are a few suggestions from our veterinary team at Berkeley Dog & Cat Hospital.

### What can I do to help relieve my puppy's teething pain?

#### Store Some Puppy Friendly Teething Toys in the Freezer

Much like teething babies, puppies often find that chewing cold or frozen items help to relieve teething pain. While there is a range of teething-specific toys available from most pet stores almost any dog toy can be frozen to help provide relief for your pup. Kongs, rubber bones, and dog-specific soft toys are all great options.

#### Offer Your Pup Extra Durable Chew Toys

Specific puppy teething bones by brands such as Nylabone are sized appropriately for small, medium and large breeds and come flavored to help encourage your puppy away from boring smelling valuables and over to a tasty chewy treat - encouraging both healthy chewing habits and relieving pain at the same time.

#### Edible Teething Sticks for Puppies

Many reputable dog food brands offer edible puppy teething treats and bones to help relieve your fur baby's mouth pain. Your vet may recommend one specifically for your little dog or you can pop by your local pet store and choose from a range of flavors and sizes. Be sure to choose the right size for your pup so they will gain the most benefit from the teething treat you choose.

#### Healthy Frozen Foods For Puppies to Chew

Many puppies enjoy tasty treats such as frozen bagels, frozen carrots or other healthy veggies. If you are planning to offer your pup a frozen food always speak to your vet first to ensure it's a good option for your pup. 

### My puppy keeps biting me, what should I do?

Nipping and biting is naturally how puppies play. When one puppy bites another too hard the hurt pup will let out a high-pitched yelp. 

If your young pup is nipping and biting at you it's important to put a stop to this behavior before it gets out of hand. One effective approach for stopping this behavior is to mimic the yelp of a hurt puppy when your little friend digs their teeth into you. A loud little 'OW' in a high-pitched voice should startle your puppy and cause them to back off. When your puppy stops and backs off be sure to offer a reward for their good behavior. 

If this approach leads your puppy to nip at you more aggressively, quietly stop playing with your puppy and walk away or gently put your pup in their crate for some quiet time.
