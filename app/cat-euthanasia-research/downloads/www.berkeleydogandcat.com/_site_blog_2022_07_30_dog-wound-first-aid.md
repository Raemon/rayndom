# First Aid For Dogs & When To Head To The Vet

Knowing how to care for your dog's wounds at home and veterinary care is called for are important aspects of being a pet parent. In today's post, our Berkeley vets offer advice on how to care for a dog wound at home and signs that it's time to head to the vet.

## Dogs Injuries & Accidents

Even the most laid-back and relaxed dog could experience an accident that leads to a cut, graze or other injury requiring first aid. That said, some wounds that may seem small can result in serious infections so if you are in doubt about whether you should take your dog to the vet, it's always best to err on the side of caution. Taking your canine companion to the vet for a wound as soon as it occurs could save your dog a lot of pain, and you a lot of money in the long run.

### Wounds That Require Veterinary Care

While some dog wounds may be cared for by pet parents, there are also wounds that should be seen by a veterinarian as soon as possible. Wounds that require veterinary care include:

  * Animals bites (these may look small but become infected very very quickly if not treated)
  * Skin that has been torn away from the flesh below (often occurs during dog fights)
  * A wound with a large object lodged in it (ie: a piece of glass or nail)
  * Wounds caused by a car accident or other trauma
  * Injuries around the eyes, head or that lead to breathing difficulties



### Putting Together Your Canine First Aid Kit

Having a pet first aid kit on hand, and a little know-how can be helpful if your dog has a minor injury. Below are a few things you should always have on hand in case your dog gets hurt.

  * Muzzle 
  * Soap or cleaning solution
  * Pet antiseptic solution (ie: 2% chlorhexidine)
  * Antimicrobial ointment for suitable for dogs
  * Sterile bandages



  * Self-adhesive bandages
  * Bandage scissors
  * Tweezers
  * Spray bottle
  * Clean towels or rags



### Dog Wound Care & First Aid For Your Pup

Wounds should be cleaned and cared for as soon as possible in order to avoid infections. Before beginning first aid on your dog, it is best to have someone to help you restain your pup and be generally supportive.

If you are unsure about what to do, or whether your pet needs veterinary care, remember that when it comes to your animal's health it is always better to err on the side of caution. When in doubt contact your vet, or an emergency vet immediately.

#### Place a Muzzle on Your Dog

A scared, anxious or hurt dog may bite while you are trying to help which is why our team recommends muzzling your hurt dog before beginning first aid treatment. It's a good idea to practice putting a muzzle on your dog before an injury arises so that your dog is used to the process and how the muzzle feels. This will help to prevent adding to your pup's distress. 

#### Check For Foreign Objects Lodged in The Wound

Look for objects or debris that may be lodged in the wound. This is especially important if the wound is on your dog's paw pad and they may have stepped on something sharp. If you are able to easily remove the object with tweezers, do so gently. If the object is lodged deeply, leave it and call your vet, or an [emergency animal hospital](/site/emergency-veterinary-care-east-bay "emergency animal hospital") immediately.

#### Clean your Dog's Wound

If the wound is on your dog's paw, you could swish the injured paw around in a clean bowl or bucket of warm water to help rinse out any dirt and debris. If the wound is elsewhere on your dog's body you can place your dog in a sink, bath, or shower and gently run clean water over the wound. You may want to add a small amount of mild baby shampoo, dish soap or hand soap to the water.

Do not use harsh cleaners or apply hydrogen peroxide, rubbing alcohol, or other caustic cleaning products to your dog’s skin as these can be painful or even cause the wound to take longer to heal.

#### Control The Bleeding

Provided that there is nothing stuck in the wound apply pressure using a clean towel. While most small wounds will stop bleeding within a couple of minutes, larger wounds are likely to take longer. Bleeding should stop within 10 minutes of applying pressure. If your dog is still bleeding after that time, contact your vet or emergency animal hospital right away.

#### Bandage Your Dog's Wound

If you have antibacterial ointment on hand you may want to apply a small amount to the area before covering the wound with a piece of sterile gauze or other bandage. Avoid using products that contain hydrocortisone or other corticosteroids. Use a self-adhesive elastic bandage to hold the gauze in place. 

#### Prevent Your Dog From Licking The Area

If your pooch is trying to lick the wound it may be necessary to have your dog wear an e-collar.

### Ongoing Care

Monitor your pup's wound at least twice a day to ensure that infection doesn't set in and healing is proceeding as expected. Clean the wound with water or a pet-safe antiseptic solution twice a day, contact your vet immediately if the wound become inflamed and shows signs of infection.

If you notice increasing redness, swelling, discharge, increasing pain in the area of the wound or a bad odor coming from the wound, contact your vet right away.
