# Why should I bring my pet in for a fecal exam?

[](//d2zp5xs5cp8zlg.cloudfront.net/image-34761-800.jpg)

The best way for your vet to help keep your pet and family safe from internal parasites is with a yearly fecal exam. Annual fecals give your Berkeley vet a chance to check for intestinal parasites before more serious conditions arise.

### What is a fecal exam?

A fecal exam is an examination of your pet's feces on a microscopic level, which is completed at your vet's office. These annuals tests (also called fecals) will help your vet identify and treat any infections which might compromising your pet's health or the health and safety of your family.

### What do fecals detect?

Your vet will investigate for markers of hookworms and roundworms among other parasites while performing these exams. These parasites can make pets irritable and uncomfortable, and could lead to many more serious issues. A number of parasites may even be transmitted to people. 

Intestinal parasites live in your pet's gastrointestinal tract, hiding them from view. That's why fecals are the best way to detect their presence. 

### How do I prepare for my pet's fecal?

Bring a fresh stool sample to your vet's office within the same day as you collected it. You should aim to bring it in within 4-6 hours for the most accurate results.

Make sure you don't let the sample dehydrate, since many of the potential parasites will be killed which can mask their presence.

### How often does my pet need a fecal?

You should have your pet tested for internal parasites at least annually. Puppies and animals with gastrointestinal issues may need fecal exams more frequently. Ask your vet how often you should bring your pet's stool sample in for a fecal.
