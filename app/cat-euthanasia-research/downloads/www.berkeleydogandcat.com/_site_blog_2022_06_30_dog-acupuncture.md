## What is veterinary acupuncture?

**Acupuncture** has been utilized for thousands of years in China where it is thought to have originated) to induce a therapeutic response in the body. Each year, an increasing number of domestic animals receive acupuncture, with excellent results. As a result, a growing number of dog owners are experimenting with acupuncture.

Curious about how acupuncture can benefit your dog? In this blog post, we'll list several advantages that acupuncture may have for your dog.

### Is dog acupuncture safe?

Acupuncture has been used successfully on a variety of different animal species, including cats and dogs. Your Berkeley veterinarian will be able to inform you whether acupuncture is a suitable therapy option for your specific circumstances.

Because the needles used in acupuncture are so small, most pets do not require pain treatment or sedation to endure an acupuncture session.

### How many acupuncture sessions will my dog need?

Because every pet is unique and has distinct reasons for seeking acupuncture therapy, the number of sessions required to treat your pet will vary greatly. Your veterinarian can give you an estimate of how many sessions will benefit your pet, but keep in mind that this may change as the treatment progresses.

### What is dog acupuncture used for?

Below are just a few of the conditions that may be improved with acupuncture treatments.

#### 1\. Pain Management & Relief

Acupuncture has been demonstrated to trigger the body's own pain-relieving endorphins and anti-inflammatory chemicals, which can aid in the relief of chronic pain. Strong medical treatments, such as chemotherapy, which can be painful, are frequently combined with acupuncture to help make a pet more comfortable. Acupuncture can also help with chronic inflammatory disorders like arthritis.

#### 2\. Improved Digestive Function

Acupuncture may aid in the normalization of digestive activity by stimulating digestive secretions and increasing blood flow to the body. Acupuncture's enhanced blood flow can help with gastrointestinal issues like diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, and nausea.

#### 3\. Improved Respiratory Function

Acupuncture can benefit pets suffering from respiratory issues such as asthma and allergies. Acupuncture has been demonstrated to offer relaxing and immune-system calming characteristics, as well as the ability to treat animals with breathing problems. Acupuncture's immune-calming and anti-inflammatory properties assist dogs as well.

#### 4\. Promotes Healing

The insertion of needles at pre-determined places is thought to boost blood flow, which is essential for healing and can actually speed up the process. It also stimulates your pet's natural waste disposal mechanism, which assists in the removal of all poisons and waste from their body.

#### 5\. May Aid in Skin Problems

Acupuncture is a popular treatment for dogs who have skin issues such as allergic dermatitis, granulomas, or hot spots. The increased circulation can promote healing.

#### Bonus: Can Help With Musculoskeletal Issues

Acupuncture can help with musculoskeletal issues such as arthritis, hip dysplasia, and nerve damage. It is frequently used during injury rehabilitation.
