# Certified Pet Loss Grief Coach - Nationwide

(3 reviews)

Verified Member since Feb 2025 

As a certified grief coach and lifelong pet lover, I specialize in providing compassionate pet loss support for those navigating the heartbreak of saying goodbye to a beloved dog, cat, or animal companion. With over 20 years of experience in veterinary medicine, I deeply understand the unique bond we share with our pets and the profound grief and mourning process that follows their loss.

My approach is warm, empathetic, and tailored to meet you exactly where you are in your healing journey. I offer one-on-one pet grief coaching sessions, pet bereavement counseling, and animal loss support groups, available throughout the United States via virtual sessions. For those local to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and the surrounding areas, I also provide in-person grief support.

Whether you are experiencing the loss of a dog, cat, or any cherished pet, I am here to walk alongside you with understanding and care as you navigate this difficult time. I am flexible with scheduling and make it a priority to get my clients booked as quickly as possible so you can receive support when you need it most.

I know I have found someone who will not only listen, but will give compassionate understanding and help. 

**\- Joleen S**

I am starting to feel better after talking, but only because Jessie listens and makes me stop and think. She also reminds me to be kind to myself in all of this and not forget all the wonderful memories. I know I'll get through this with her guidance and compassion. 

**\- Joleen S**

Great! Jessie is very compassionate and understanding.
