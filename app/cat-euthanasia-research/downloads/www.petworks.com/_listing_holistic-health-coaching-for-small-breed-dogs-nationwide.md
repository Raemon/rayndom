# Holistic Health Coaching for Small Breed Dogs - Nationwide

(14 reviews)

Verified Member since Nov 2023 

I am a Certified Holistic Pet Health Coach, a Certified Professional Canine Nutritionist and winner of Petworks Best of 2024 award. As the owner of SparkedUpDogs, I focus on working with small breed dogs. Smaller dogs tend to have a longer lifespan with unique dietary requirements. Feeding a fresh, anti-inflammatory, home-cooked diet with whole-foods ingredients provides immune and digestive support, helps to reduce discomfort and promotes longevity.   
I take an individualized approach and offer 1-1 consultations to provide simple, gently-cooked recipes, natural solutions and actionable steps to guide dog parents on their best friend's healing journey. 

  


  * Certified
  * Insured
  * Online Sessions

Fix My Recipe

$ 50.00 Per Recipe [book](/holistic-health-coaching-for-small-breed-dogs-nationwide/book?id=7756)

You're already ahead of the game - you're cooking for your dog! That’s amazing. But if you grabbed your recipe from a Facebook group, a random blog, or can't even remember where it came from… there’s a 95% chance it’s not complete and balanced.

Let’s fix that.

Even the healthiest fresh ingredients can fall short if key nutrients are missing. And if you’re feeding the same unbalanced recipe long-term, nutrient deficiencies can slowly creep in - affecting your dog’s energy, immune system, and overall health.

Save time. Stop guessing. Start nourishing.

Instead of asking for opinions from strangers in online forums, send me your dog’s recipe and how you prepare it. I’ll analyze and revise your recipe to ensure it’s nutritionally complete.

What you’ll get:   
• Clear ingredient adjustments   
• Additional ingredient/supplement recommendations (with links)   
• Revised, balanced recipe delivered within 3 business days   
• Reply to one follow-up email for clarification (not recipe reworking), valid within 5 days of delivery

Please note: This is a recipe balancing service only and does not include a consultation. It won’t assess whether the recipe is ideal for your dog’s unique needs - just that it’s nutritionally complete.

As a Certified Professional Canine Nutritionist, I don’t recommend feeding the same recipe long-term. Rotating ingredients and recipes is key to avoiding sensitivities and providing variety.   
If your dog has health concerns like kidney disease, pancreatitis, elevated liver enzymes, or food sensitivities, or if you’d like recipes tailored to your dog’s individual needs, please book a 60-minute consultation on this page.

**\- Adriana B**

**\- Mario P**

Bea was very thorough and went over recipes and my dog's specific dietary and health issues.She took her time,answering all of my concerns. I feel more confident now that I'll be able to cook for Finn and I already see an improvement in him.I highly recommend Bea for anyone struggling with their dog's diet.I want to add that when I was sending inquiries, most of the answers were on the generic side. Bea took the time to tell me her ideas and suggestions before I even chose her.That's when I stopped looking.I knew she was the right nutritionist for us.Don't hesitate to use her.She's extremely knowledgeable. 

**\- Joyce T**

She was so thorough, knowledgeable, and encouraging about diet and nutrition. I just really love the whole holistic healing with proper nutrition and healthy supplementation. I personally see a naturopath so why wouldn’t I want my fur babies to be taken care of the same way with nutrition and holistic healing? Can’t wait to see my babies thrive health wise and try these recipes for them, I know they will never look at food the same way!

**\- Sarah S**

Bea has been wonderful to work with she is knowledgeable in helping me with my cavachon”s health and preparing healthy foods n supplements. I now adopted a new puppy n Bea is helping me with her new diet n health as she grows n educateing me on vaccines schedule etc. 

**\- Heidi C**

Excellent! Bea was so knowledgeable and kind in presenting the diet for Daisy! We’re excited to cook for our girl and pray it works for her! Thank you Bea for your guidance!

**\- Suzie W**

Bea really knows her stuff! Our 11 year old Havanese has a sensitive stomach (mild pancreatitis) along with some knee/ joint issues. Bea knew exactly what he needed for his diet, as well as supplements. Bea created some of the most nutritious, delicious, and easy recipes we have ever made. We have used other recipes in the past, even one from our vet, but Bea's smelled and looked the best...just like people food! We made our first batch of food tonight and Barkley licked the bowl clean. He was so happy! If you are looking for a nutritious and simple answer to healthy pet food that's made in one pot, look no further than Bea!

Bea was quick to respond and asked great questions. I'm looking forward to getting her assitance.

We are extremely blessed to have come across Bea. She was thorough and assuring especially when it came to my worries in switching over from prescription food. I feel much more educated and comfortable after researching the benefits of the diet she gave me. This will be our second week following her advice and so far I am seeing improvement in my dogs and excited to see even more results.

Thank you so much for your kind and thoughtful words, Melany! You are doing so much for your boys - they are definitely a lucky pair!

**\- Bea Swasey Patterson**

I am really impressed by how detailed she is with putting together a complete nutrition plan for Shadow. Bea is very knowledgeable and caring and responds to my many questions in a timely manner. Shadow is a mini schnauzer poodle mix and was recently diagnosed with CKD so it needed to be dealt with urgently. Our first meeting was amazing and I felt a huge sense of relief wash over me as we talked about treating shadow with home cooked meals instead of a commercial prescription diet. I felt like she really understood me and my dog’s needs and I am so glad I chose her to guide and support us through Shadow’s health journey. Thank you, Bea, for your incredible work and kindness!

The session I booked with Bea was super helpful. We went over my dogs issues and concerns I had and Bea gave me guidance as well as a whole write-up of how to approach feeding Biscuit. She has also been available for questions Ive had along the way. So far Im seeing good results and Biscuit’s itchiness and acid reflux have improved to the point that Im starting to wean her off her meds. Thank you Bea!

**\- Monica B**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

Thank you so much for sharing your experience, Monica! I am thrilled to hear Biscuit is feeling better and that the guidance has been helpful for both of you. It’s been a pleasure working with you, and I’m always here for any questions along the way.

Bea is great! She was very prepared and provided a lot of detailed information during my consultation to help with my dog's dietary needs.
