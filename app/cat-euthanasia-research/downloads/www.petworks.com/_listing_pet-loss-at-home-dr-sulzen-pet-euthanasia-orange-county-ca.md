# Pet Loss at Home - Dr. Sulzen - Pet Euthanasia - Orange County, CA

(3 reviews)

Member since Jun 2019 

At our caring team in Santa Ana, CA, we understand that losing a pet is one of life's most challenging experiences. With over two years of dedicated service to the pet community of Orange County, we specialize in compassionate at-home euthanasia for cats, dogs, guinea pigs, hamsters, and rabbits. Our licensed veterinarians bring a wealth of expertise, holding certifications from esteemed organizations such as the American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA), Association for Pet Loss and Bereavement (APLB), and the Companion Animal Euthanasia Training Academy (CAETA). This extensive training ensures that we provide the most compassionate and respectful care during this difficult time.

We offer a comprehensive range of services designed to support you through every step of the process, from planning and coping to memorializing your beloved pet. Our visits include thoughtful touches like lighting candles, playing relaxing music, and arranging blankets or flower petals to create a soothing environment. Each home visit involves a simple sedation followed by euthanasia, with options for home burial or cremation, with or without ashes. While our home visits may be more costly due to the extensive time and care involved, we believe in providing the utmost comfort and dignity to your pet and your family.

Our team travels across large service areas, dedicating time to ensure that we can be there when you need us most. We typically spend 30 to 60 minutes at your home to allow for a peaceful farewell. We encourage you to surround yourself with family and friends during this time and give your other pets the opportunity to say goodbye. If you're facing an urgent situation, please don't hesitate to call us at 877-219-4811. We are here to help you every step of the way.

## Customer Reviews

Dr. Tracey Decter and Pet Loss At Home was the perfect selection for our family to say goodbye to our beloved Kodi. She was so empathetic and patient. She kept checking in with us making sure all our questions up to the day of were answered. She explained everything and told us what we could expect which made it easier for us to prepare. She helped us say goodbye to our pet with love and dignity and he was able to be comfortable at home and not scared in a clinic or somewhere unfamiliar. If you are in the unfortunate spot where you have to make this decision just know she will make the decision that much better. I can't say enough about how happy and at peace I am with how we were able to say goodbye to our boy. - West Palm Beach, Florida - February 2025

My beloved pooch was a shelter rescue who had been adopted and returned multiple times before we found each other. The vet's office reminded him of being dropped off and left behind, so when it was clear his time had come I really didn't want his last moments to be in the vet's office. We had several good years together and I felt so grateful for all of the love he had given me. I really wanted to do well by him at the end. At 10 p.m. on a Monday night, I called the number for Pet Loss at Home and listened to the pre-recorded greeting. It instructed me to call or text the number in the greeting. I texted and was relieved when Dr. Rachel wrote back quickly. She agreed to come at 8:00 a.m. the next day. I felt fortunate that she was able to come to my home on such short notice. She arrived on time at 8 a.m. and could not have been kinder or more professional. She was wonderful to my sweet boy and very soothing. This was probably one of the hardest things I've ever had to do and it felt comforting to be able to say goodbye in our home, sitting in his favorite spot together. Dr. Rachel gave hugs before she left and a couple of days later I received a touching card in the mail. I didn't really do much research into this service as my dog declined very quickly and I was concerned about whether or not the person who arrived would be compassionate and professional. Dr. Rachel was all of that and more. My heart goes out to you if you're in need of this service, but if you do, you're in good hands.

I had to have my cat Jackson put to sleep this evening. Dr. Allegra Liu was very professional and compassionate. She came to my home on very short notice. I would recommend this vet for all of your pet needs. I am very grateful to her and her genuine love for our fur babies! Thank you Dr. - San Francisco, CA
