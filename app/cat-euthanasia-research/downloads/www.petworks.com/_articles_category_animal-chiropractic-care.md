# How Do I Find A Holistic Vet Near Me?

Holistic Vet Near Me….Is Right Here! Holistic Pet Care: The Rise of Online Consultations in Modern Pet Wellness. In the ever-evolving landscape of pet wellness, holistic care has become a popular alternative to traditional veterinary practices. By addressing the physical, emotional, and even spiritual needs of pets, holistic specialists aim to enhance overall well-being, focusing on prevention and natural remedies. With the rise of telehealth and online platforms, holistic care specialists are now offering consultations virtually, making their services more accessible than ever before. This shift is transforming how pet parents approach their furry friends’ health, often bypassing the need for traditional vet office visits.

### What Is Holistic Pet Care?

Holistic pet care focuses on treating the whole animal rather than just the symptoms of an ailment. Unlike conventional veterinary care, which often relies on medications and surgeries, holistic practices integrate alternative therapies such as acupuncture, herbal medicine, [animal chiropractic care](https://www.petworks.com/hire/animal-chiropractic), and [pet nutritional counseling](https://www.petworks.com/hire/pet-nutritionist). These methods emphasize preventive care, aiming to strengthen a pet’s immune system, address root causes of illness, and promote long-term vitality.

Holistic practitioners view pets as unique individuals with distinct needs, tailoring treatments to their personalities, medical histories, and environmental factors. For instance, a dog with chronic anxiety may benefit from a combination of dietary adjustments, aromatherapy, and behavior training instead of just a prescription for anti-anxiety medication.

### Holistic Vet Near Me – The Growth of Online Consultations

The demand for virtual holistic pet care consultations has surged in recent years, driven by convenience, accessibility, and advancements in telecommunication technology. Online consultations allow pet parents to connect with certified holistic specialists regardless of their geographic location, enabling them to access expert advice without leaving their homes.

This approach is especially beneficial for pet owners in rural or underserved areas, where finding holistic veterinarians or specialists might be challenging. Additionally, virtual consultations eliminate the stress associated with transporting pets to a clinic, particularly for animals prone to anxiety or motion sickness.

**“I would define holistic veterinary care as using all diagnostic and treatment modalities that are available and effective, whether it’s a traditional pharmaceutical or an ancient herb, to address all aspects of an animal’s health.”** – [Dr. Angie Krause, Boulder Holistic Vet](https://boulderholisticvet.com/)

### How Online Holistic Pet Care Works

Online holistic consultations typically begin with an in-depth assessment of the pet’s health history, lifestyle, and current concerns. Pet parents may be asked to fill out detailed questionnaires or submit photos and videos showcasing their pet’s behavior, posture, or physical symptoms.

During the video call, the specialist reviews the information and collaborates with the owner to develop a personalized care plan. Depending on the issue, the plan might include dietary changes, natural supplements, at-home massage techniques, or recommendations for local practitioners who can provide hands-on treatments like acupuncture or chiropractic adjustments.

For example, a [cat with chronic digestive issues](https://www.merckvetmanual.com/cat-owners/digestive-disorders-of-cats/disorders-of-the-stomach-and-intestines-in-cats) may be prescribed a species-appropriate diet rich in fresh, unprocessed foods, along with probiotics and herbal supplements. Similarly, a dog recovering from an injury might be guided through at-home physical therapy exercises to improve mobility.

### Advantages of Virtual Holistic Consultations

#### 1\. **Convenience and Accessibility**

Busy schedules and long commutes to veterinary clinics often deter pet parents from seeking regular care. Virtual consultations remove these barriers, allowing appointments to be scheduled at times that suit the owner’s routine.

#### 2\. **Stress-Free Experience for Pets**

Many animals become anxious in clinical settings due to unfamiliar smells, loud noises, or interactions with other pets. By staying in their comfortable home environment, pets remain relaxed during their assessments, leading to more accurate evaluations.

#### 3\. **Tailored and Comprehensive Care**

Holistic specialists often spend more time with clients during virtual consultations than a typical veterinary visit allows. This extended interaction fosters a deeper understanding of the pet’s overall health and enables more personalized recommendations.

#### 4\. **Focus on Prevention**

Holistic care emphasizes preventive measures, empowering pet parents to address potential issues before they escalate into chronic conditions. This proactive approach often results in lower long-term healthcare costs.

#### 5\. **Global Access to Experts**

With online consultations, pet owners can connect with renowned holistic practitioners worldwide, ensuring access to specialized expertise that may not be available locally.

“The veterinarian’s oath includes the promise ‘to protect animal health and welfare, prevent and relieve animal suffering.’ It is a noble profession that demands a selfless commitment to serving the needs of animals.” – [Tom Meyer, President, AVMA](https://www.avma.org/javma-news/2016-10-01/new-avma-president-commits-member-wellness)

### Replacing Traditional Vet Visits?

Although you might be seeking an holistic vet near me, holistic online consultations offer numerous benefits, they are not a complete replacement for in-person veterinary care. Certain medical conditions require diagnostic tests, imaging, or emergency interventions that only a physical clinic can provide. However, holistic virtual care serves as an excellent complement to traditional veterinary medicine.

For example, a pet recovering from surgery may benefit from a holistic specialist’s input on pain management, nutrition, and rehabilitation techniques alongside the primary veterinarian’s treatment plan. Similarly, chronic issues like arthritis, skin conditions, or anxiety can be addressed holistically to reduce reliance on pharmaceuticals.

### Choosing the Right Holistic Care Specialist

To ensure a positive experience, pet parents should research the credentials and qualifications of holistic practitioners offering online consultations. Look for certifications from reputable organizations such as the American Holistic Veterinary Medical Association ([AHVMA](https://www.ahvma.org/)) or the International Veterinary Acupuncture Society (IVAS). Reading reviews, testimonials, and asking for recommendations can also help identify trustworthy professionals.

It’s also important to establish clear communication with the specialist. Transparency about your pet’s medical history, previous treatments, and ongoing conditions will help them craft the most effective care plan.

### **The Future of Holistic Pet Care**

As technology continues to advance, the future of holistic pet care looks promising. Innovations like wearable health trackers for pets, telemedicine apps, and AI-driven diagnostic tools are likely to enhance the effectiveness and accessibility of online consultations. Additionally, increased awareness about the benefits of holistic practices will encourage more pet parents to explore these alternatives.

Pet owners are also becoming more educated about the importance of natural remedies, balanced nutrition, and preventive care. This shift in mindset aligns with the principles of holistic care, fostering a more integrative approach to pet health.

The rise of online holistic consultations represents a significant step forward in pet wellness. By offering convenient, personalized, and stress-free care, holistic specialists are transforming how pet parents approach their furry companions’ health. While not a complete replacement for traditional veterinary services, virtual holistic care is an invaluable resource. It empowers owners to take a proactive role in their pets’ overall well-being.

## Frequently Asked Questions about Animal Chiropractic Care

**What is animal chiropractic care?**  
Animal chiropractic care is a non‑invasive, drug‑free therapy in which a trained chiropractor uses manual adjustments to address spinal and joint misalignments (subluxations) in pets. These adjustments aim to restore proper skeletal alignment and support the nervous system, enhancing overall comfort and mobility for animals.

**Which pets can benefit from chiropractic care?**  
Dogs, horses, and cats are the most common recipients of animal chiropractic care. In some cases, other vertebrate pets or working animals may also benefit, depending on the chiropractor’s training and the animal’s specific needs.

**How do I know if my pet needs chiropractic care?**  
Common signs that a pet might benefit include limping or favoring one leg, stiffness or reluctance to jump, hop, climb stairs, or move as usual; changes in gait or posture; stiffness after rest; decreased activity or energy; or behavioral changes that may be rooted in discomfort.

**Is animal chiropractic safe for my pet?**  
When performed by a properly trained and certified animal chiropractor, chiropractic care for pets is considered low‑risk, gentle, and non-invasive. That said, it should _not_ replace standard veterinary care. Instead, it’s often used as a complementary therapy in conjunction with regular veterinary check‑ups or treatments.

**What benefits can animal chiropractic offer?**  
Animal chiropractic care may help:

  * relieve pain from musculoskeletal issues such as arthritis, joint strain, or spinal misalignment.

  * improve mobility and flexibility, restoring normal joint motion and helping pets move more comfortably.

  * support healing and recovery after injuries or surgery by promoting proper alignment and reducing strain on tissues.

  * enhance overall wellness, including reducing stiffness, improving gait, and supporting a better quality of life for older or arthritic pets.




### **How often should my pet get chiropractic treatments?**

The ideal frequency depends on the pet’s size, age, health status, and reason for treatment. A qualified chiropractor will perform an initial evaluation and then recommend a treatment plan tailored to your pet’s needs. Some pets may benefit from routine or maintenance sessions, while others only need occasional adjustments.

### **Can chiropractic care replace traditional veterinary medicine?**

No. Animal chiropractic care is best used as a complementary therapy alongside conventional veterinary care. It does not substitute for diagnostics, surgeries, medications, or other medical treatments when those are necessary. A proper veterinary evaluation should always precede chiropractic care, especially if your pet has serious or complex health issues.

# Why Every Senior Dog Needs a Canine Chiropractor

Aging is not easy for anyone, especially our dogs. A dog may get weaker in the back end or find it hard to get up and down; she might stop using stairs or experience discomfort. This can be tough for a pet parent to come to grips with.

What if I told you that [dog chiropractic care](https://www.petworks.com/hire/dog-chiropractor) can help? We see it all the time in our practice. It helps with mobility problems, comfort, and activity levels, and can even slow the progression of arthritis. In this article I’ll define who is considered a senior dog, explain what animal chiropractic is, list some issues it helps, and then tell you how to find a properly trained animal chiropractor.

### **Who Is Considered a Senior Dog?**

You probably know that dogs age much faster than humans do. However, did you know that certain breeds and different-size dogs age differently than others? Since, generally speaking, smaller breeds live longer than larger breeds, the best definition for a senior dog is any animal in the last 25 percent of his life, based on the standard for the breed. This is usually when we start to see the symptoms of aging—which can be alleviated by animal chiropractic.

### **What Is Animal Chiropractic?**

Although most people have heard of chiropractic for humans, many people are confused about what chiropractic actually is. Chiropractors are trained to evaluate the spine for structural dysfunction, often referred to as subluxations.

Subluxations are areas in the spine that aren’t moving like they should be or are in the wrong position. When dysfunction like this occurs, inflammation can build up and stress joints, nerves, and more, leading to pain and stiffness. A chiropractor palpates the spine, searching for heat…which would indicate inflammation…for muscle spasm, and for joints that aren’t moving very well. When the chiropractor locates a problematic area, she gives a correction via an adjustment in order to restore normal biomechanics. When it comes to animal chiropractic, the adjustment is very gentle, and there’s typically no cracking or popping.

### **What Conditions in a Senior Dog Might Be Improved by seeing a Dog Chiropractor**

The spine of a senior dog has endured a lifetime of wear and tear. This contributes to difficulties we frequently see in practice, such as:

* Decreased mobility

* Discomfort

* Decreased rear muscle tone

* Arthritis

Many of these symptoms are secondary to subluxations of the spine, and they are often intertwined.

Initially, a joint quits moving well. This doesn’t cause too many problems at a young age, but if it is left uncorrected, inflammation eventually builds to a point where it is uncomfortable for a dog to fully engage a joint. When this happens, a pet owner might notice that a dog doesn’t want to use stairs anymore or really struggles to get comfortable in any position.

### **Pain**

Over time, this discomfort starts to affect the muscles. If a dog finds it painful to walk, or to get up from lying down, he will not do it. The muscles start to atrophy, and even more stress is placed on the joints because there’s less muscle to support them. The old adage “Use it or lose it” applies here. A dog will certainly lose muscle tone if she doesn’t use it. This becomes cyclical: The discomfort leads to less movement and more muscle wasting, which leads to even less movement and even more muscle wasting.

This cycle also contributes to arthritis. Arthritis is the result of chronic inflammation and abnormal stress on a joint; it is caused by abnormal biomechanics over a long period of time. A subluxation left uncorrected is exactly this. The lack of normal motion in the joint will lead to an inability to pump inflammation away. The longer the inflammation sits there, the more it eats away at cartilage. In addition, this loads a joint up with abnormal stress, and combined, these factors progressively lead to arthritis.

### **The Benefits of Having a Dog Chiropractor**

The great thing about dog chiropractors is that they are trained to find and correct subluxations, which will help alleviate many of the problems senior dogs deal with. An adjustment will restore normal motion to a joint. Restoring motion allows joints to pump inflammation away. With a decrease in inflammation, there’s a decrease in pain. When the pain is gone, the dog is more much more mobile and willing to be active. This will lead to increased muscle tone.

Needless to say, a dog chiropractor can be a very important therapy for an aging dog. So who is trained appropriately to work with animals?

### **How Do I Find a Dog Chiropractor?**

There are two routes to becoming an animal chiropractor. Practitioners must first complete veterinary or chiropractic school and receive a doctorate. After that, they attend additional training for animal chiropractic at a different program that includes both textbook and hands-on curricula. At the end of training, they have an opportunity to certify with one of the major boards, among them the American Veterinary Chiropractic Association and the [International Veterinary Chiropractic Association](https://ivca.de/).

My personal recommendation would be to search out a chiropractic practitioner on Petworks who is board-certified. If you can’t find someone local, then look for a person who has attended a program in preparation for the boards. Some of these programs include Options for Animals, Healing Oasis, the Parker University Animal Chiropractic Program, or Animal Care Equipment and Services (ACES).

It is inevitable that members of our fur family will age, but fortunately, there are natural solutions, such as animal chiropractic, that can help. Is your pet a senior? Find an animal chiropractor today!
