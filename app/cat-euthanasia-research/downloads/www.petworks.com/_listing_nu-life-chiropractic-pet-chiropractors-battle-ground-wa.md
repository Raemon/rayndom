# Nu-Life Chiropractic - Pet Chiropractors - Battle Ground, WA

Member since Aug 2019 

As a licensed chiropractor with years of experience, I specialize in providing comprehensive pet chiropractic care, massage therapy, and advanced treatments such as cold laser therapy and total body vibration for a variety of animals including dogs, cats, rabbits, goats, horses, and even alpacas. Since 2012, I have been dedicated to serving Battle Ground, WA, and the surrounding areas, helping pets recover from injuries, improve mobility, and enhance their overall well-being. My training and certifications ensure that I use the safest and most effective techniques tailored to each animal's specific needs. 

I offer affordable services with small animal visits starting at $65 and large animals at $150. My mobile services bring the care directly to your doorstep, making it more convenient for you and your furry friends. I am fully insured and committed to maintaining high standards of professionalism and care. It’s important to me that every pet receives personalized attention, and I always encourage a 24-hour notice for cancellations to ensure that I can accommodate all my clients effectively.

Ready to prioritize your pet's health and comfort? Whether you’re looking for treatment to ease discomfort or simply want to enhance your pet's quality of life, I’m here to help. Don’t hesitate to reach out and book a session through Petworks today! Your pet deserves the best care available, and I’m excited to be a part of their journey to wellness.
