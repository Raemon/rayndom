**\- James J**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

The diet provided was a veterinarian formulated diet for Pancreatitis and is low-fat. Before a negative review, client did not communicate to clear up any issues.

##### Pet Pro's Response:

Client did not read the description of the services offered nor was I able to render service before giving a poor review.
