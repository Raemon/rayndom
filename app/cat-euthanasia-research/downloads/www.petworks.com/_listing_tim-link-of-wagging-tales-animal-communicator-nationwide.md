Tim answered me so quickly and he is very kind. He also helped me more than anyone else because with dowsing he found that my cat had moved from the original area he got lost in. He even gave me a map with pinpointed spots.

Incredible Experience – Tim Helped Us Find Our Missing Cat!

When our beloved cat, Boo, went missing on May 11 in Utrecht, Netherlands, I was devastated. We searched tirelessly—distributing 400 flyers, conducting physical searches multiple times a day at different hours, hiring a sniffer dog, knocking on doors, and connecting with the community through Nextdoor, Facebook, and Reddit. After 10 days with no luck, I felt completely drained and desperate for a new approach.

That's when I came across Petworks and found Tim Link, an animal communicator based in Georgia, USA. After reading many reviews, I reached out to him, and I’m so grateful I did. Tim responded to my inquiry quickly, and within an hour of receiving the details, he had already communicated with Boo. He sent me a specific map outlining the area where Boo’s energy felt strongest.

My husband and I immediately searched the area that night, and incredibly—we found Boo! He was hiding in a garden behind a business center, just as Tim had indicated.

I understand that animal communication isn’t a guaranteed solution, but I truly believe Tim helped guide us to Boo. I’m beyond grateful for his help and compassion during such a difficult time. After 10 stressful days, I’m now curled up at home with Boo safe and sound.

Thank you, Tim. You gave us hope when we were running out of it.

**\- Lesli S**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

Thank you so much for your kind words and wonderful review. It was an honor to help you and Boo.   
Please give Boo a BIG HUG and Cuddle from me!   
Thanks,   
Tim

**\- Tim Link**

Tim has been so encouraging and helpful to me. My cat is still missing but as Tim has shown, he appears to be moving a lot in neighborhoods with a lot of fences and private backyards. The search goes on.

**\- Mary S**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

Thanks! Always glad to assist. I'm glad all is well, and a happy reunion had by all!

**\- Tim Link**

When my cat Dusty went missing, I was devastated. He got away from me at an animal hospital that was at least a mile from my home. The reason I brought him was because he had something wrong with his foot and was limping. He ran down the first side street he found and disappeared. I thought I would never see him again. I put up posters all over that neighborhood and used a site called pawboost.com to send alerts to Facebook, Nextdoor, and Instagram. Also used a site called lostmykitty.com that sent out alerts to vets and shelters so I didn’t have to. I did everything I possibly could but it just didn’t seem like enough. 

I decided to contact an animal communicator. I had used one before for another kind of issue and found it helpful. I made the mistake of using a random website featuring available psychics. Talking to a few of them turned out to be disheartening. I got conflicting information and didn’t feel very confident. Rather than waste more time, I did a search for the best animal communicators and kept seeing the name Lydia Hilby as someone very respected in this field. I found out she doesn’t work with missing animals but she recommended Tim.

When I left a message for Tim he responded quickly and immediately got to work. Through map dowsing, he was able to pinpoint a few spots where he sensed energy on the map. I found out I had been looking in the wrong place because Dusty had moved on to a new neighborhood.

As days past I contacted Tim again to find out where Dusty was so I could continue to search. Meanwhile, I was getting a few leads from Nextdoor. Two were Ring videos that showed a limping cat. The problem was that they were on opposite ends of town. One really looked like Dusty but I couldn’t be sure. Searching for a small cat in a big town is like looking for the proverbial needle in the haystack. Rather than spread myself thin, I contacted Tim a third time to find out Dusty’s current location. Once again using map dowsing, Tim pinpointed two spots where he sensed energy. Both were very near one of the addresses where the video showed a cat like Dusty. Now that I was sure where to look, I contacted the homeowner and she graciously let me do a stakeout in her front yard. That night, a small cat walked out of the bushes and it was him! I was so relieved! Took me a while to coax him but eventually I managed to get him home. Finally!

Throughout this process, Tim was so kind and reassuring. Out of everything I tried, he gave me the most accurate information and the most hope that I would be reunited with Dusty. I could not have done this without his help and encouragement. If you have a missing pet, the best thing you can do is talk to Tim. He turned a seemingly one-in-a-million chance of finding my cat into a successful reunion.

**\- Mary S**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

Yeah! I'm so glad Dusty is back home and doing well. I was glad to have assisted!

**\- Tim Link**

I appreciate your attention to detail and support for my sweet cat and myself. My faith and hope have been refreshed.

Not on a rating scale - Would NEVER recommend! 100% - INACCURATE! 

**\- Debbie C**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

I reached out to Debbie the same day that she left her feedback and asked her why she left the feedback she did. However, as of this morning, she has not replied with any additional information.   
While I completely understand the frustration associated with a missing pet, questioning my integrity isn’t the most constructive way to proceed.   
When I work with a missing animal anywhere in the world (literally), I’ve never had an instance where the communication didn’t yield information. As in every case, I ask the missing animal questions that are relevant to their surroundings, how they got there, who they’re with, what the people look like, are there any landmarks nearby, can they hear any unique noises or detect any unique smells, etc.   
As for any living being’s unique energy, absolutely no two are alike. As such, I make a connection with that animal’s specific energy. It’s a telepathic connection in which I have a conversation telepathically with the missing animal asking questions that will yield relevant information that I can pass on in hopes of reuniting you with your pet. During each conversation, a missing animal shares whatever they want to share based on the questions asked. For example, they can show me images, share smells, tastes, and noises with me, they share words and sentences with me, and I can tell (because I’m also empathic) if they’re scared, anxious, or feeling any other emotion or if they are injured. Also to note, if an animal has passed over, their energy feels “floaty” rather than “grounded” and in body.   
I’ve been an animal communicator for over 20 years and have worked with thousands of animals. Other animal communicators refer their missing animal cases to me because that is my area of expertise. Unfortunately, that doesn’t mean that every animal is reunited with their family. In addition, there have been several cases where the animal may not be found the first time I work with them but, instead, found during a later interaction with me.   
While I can’t predict the outcome of any missing animal being found, I always share everything the animal shares with me and what I get when I do the map dowsing. My listing is very clear as to what this type of consultation includes. I provided exactly what I said I would.   
Namaste,   
Tim
