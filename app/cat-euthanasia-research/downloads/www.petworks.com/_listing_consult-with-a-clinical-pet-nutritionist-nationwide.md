## Customer Reviews

Debbie is fantastic! Our 13 year old pup was very sick and was in the hospital for 5 days. We were aware of his heart disease and was monitoring it for over a year and we had just taken him to the vet for an ultra sound and check up. A couple days later he became very ill and we had to take him to the emergency vet. There we found he had low blood pressure, was suffering from kidney failure, and possibly lymphoma. The vets were able to stabilize him and wished us the best but we did not have much guidelines on how to help him. We contacted Debbie and have been working with her for about a month. our dog has been more alert, blood pressure is back to normal and his kidney labs are getting back to a healthy range. I truly accredit Debbie for helping us nurse our pup back to health. Thank you!

**\- Jade A**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

Love working with pet parents that have great questions! This family will have many years of health with all they are doing for their new family member. I applaud them for reaching out! Nice job:)

**\- Debbie Brookham**

Debbie was amazing! My dog Bella was diagnosed with Osteosarcoma. Through my own research I knew I had to get her off the food the vet had prescribed her due to kidney issues. Debbie provided a great recipe for food I am now making at home to support Bella as she fights cancer and helps to keep her kidneys going. Bella is also a huge fan of her new food. Chemo has really effected her appetite but now she is back to begging for food and being excited about dinner time. She will lick everything completely clean where as before she would leave most of her food after just taking a few bites. Debbie also provided a great list of supplements that we are now a few days into giving. So far many of the chemo side effects we were battling have resolved themselves just with this new food. Thank you so much Debbie for all of your help! 

**\- Allyson H**

**\- Debbie Brookham**

Debbie was very helpful and knowledgeable. My cat has stage 2 kidney disease and her traditional vet couldn't answer a lot of my questions about the best nutrition for her. Debbie helped me understand what my kitty needs, what she shouldn't eat, and gave me tons of resources for food to try, supplements, and learning resources. The consultation was beyond what I expected. I highly recommend Debbie.

##### Pet Pro's Response:

**\- Debbie Brookham**

Things went very well. Debbie was very responsive in setting up the appointment quickly. She took her time during the appointment. She reviewed my dogs labs and was very informative about liver disease. The recipes I received were whole food based, full of great ingredients. She included the macronutrient and micronutrient profile. She also gave a list of supplements that would be beneficial to my elderly dog. She was very thorough. She answered the questions I had about the recipes as well. The only suggestion I would make with the recipes is to use ingredients that are readily available in a person's state or town. Turkey giblets are very difficult to find where I live and surprisingly beef hearts are hit or miss even at the butcher. So two of the four recipes I won't be able to use. Otherwise I had a great experience with Debbie. I would use her again and highly recommend her.

**\- Stephanie E**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

Hi Stephanie! Thanks for the kinds words and feedback. I just want to confirm I did reconfigure both those recipes for you when you were unable to find the giblets and beef heart. If you did not, please send an email and I can resend. Thanks again!

It went good. But honestly too short of a time for $100. I got some suggestions but still need help. Having to pay another $100 I'm not sure is worth it. 

Not 100% satisfied.

## Customer Reviews

Debbie is fantastic! Our 13 year old pup was very sick and was in the hospital for 5 days. We were aware of his heart disease and was monitoring it for over a year and we had just taken him to the vet for an ultra sound and check up. A couple days later he became very ill and we had to take him to the emergency vet. There we found he had low blood pressure, was suffering from kidney failure, and possibly lymphoma. The vets were able to stabilize him and wished us the best but we did not have much guidelines on how to help him. We contacted Debbie and have been working with her for about a month. our dog has been more alert, blood pressure is back to normal and his kidney labs are getting back to a healthy range. I truly accredit Debbie for helping us nurse our pup back to health. Thank you!

**\- Jade A**

##### Pet Pro Response:

Love working with pet parents that have great questions! This family will have many years of health with all they are doing for their new family member. I applaud them for reaching out! Nice job:)

**\- Debbie Brookham**

Debbie was amazing! My dog Bella was diagnosed with Osteosarcoma. Through my own research I knew I had to get her off the food the vet had prescribed her due to kidney issues. Debbie provided a great recipe for food I am now making at home to support Bella as she fights cancer and helps to keep her kidneys going. Bella is also a huge fan of her new food. Chemo has really effected her appetite but now she is back to begging for food and being excited about dinner time. She will lick everything completely clean where as before she would leave most of her food after just taking a few bites. Debbie also provided a great list of supplements that we are now a few days into giving. So far many of the chemo side effects we were battling have resolved themselves just with this new food. Thank you so much Debbie for all of your help! 

**\- Allyson H**

Fantastic! What a great pet parent searching for the right answers to create a healthy journey for her fur baby! Way to go!

**\- Debbie Brookham**

Debbie was very helpful and knowledgeable. My cat has stage 2 kidney disease and her traditional vet couldn't answer a lot of my questions about the best nutrition for her. Debbie helped me understand what my kitty needs, what she shouldn't eat, and gave me tons of resources for food to try, supplements, and learning resources. The consultation was beyond what I expected. I highly recommend Debbie. 

**\- Kristine M**

##### Pet Pro Response:

**\- Debbie Brookham**

Things went very well. Debbie was very responsive in setting up the appointment quickly. She took her time during the appointment. She reviewed my dogs labs and was very informative about liver disease. The recipes I received were whole food based, full of great ingredients. She included the macronutrient and micronutrient profile. She also gave a list of supplements that would be beneficial to my elderly dog. She was very thorough. She answered the questions I had about the recipes as well. The only suggestion I would make with the recipes is to use ingredients that are readily available in a person's state or town. Turkey giblets are very difficult to find where I live and surprisingly beef hearts are hit or miss even at the butcher. So two of the four recipes I won't be able to use. Otherwise I had a great experience with Debbie. I would use her again and highly recommend her.

**\- Stephanie E**

##### Pet Pro Response:

Hi Stephanie! Thanks for the kinds words and feedback. I just want to confirm I did reconfigure both those recipes for you when you were unable to find the giblets and beef heart. If you did not, please send an email and I can resend. Thanks again!
