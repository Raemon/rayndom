Are you supporting your pet in its last days? I can support YOU!

ANSWERS YOUR QUESTIONS:   
Is it ready to go?

At home or at the vet?   
What sign will it give me when it's ready?   
If no, how can you help its pain?   
What does it need for comfort?

I've conducted hundreds of these types of sessions and love to watch the warm healing that comes in like a miracle.
