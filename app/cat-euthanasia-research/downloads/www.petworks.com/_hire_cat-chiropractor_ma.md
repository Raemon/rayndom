Cat Chiropractic Care: A New Wellness Approach for the betterment of cat's overall health. Feline chiropractors in Massachusetts offer a holistic approach to enhancing cat health and well-being by addressing spinal misalignments, or subluxations. These adjustments can alleviate pain, reduce inflammation, and improve mobility, which is especially beneficial for cats with chronic conditions such as arthritis, intervertebral disc disease (IVDD), or trauma-related injuries.

**PAA**

**Is chiropractic care safe and effective for cats?**

Yes, when performed by a certified animal chiropractor, chiropractic care is generally safe and can be very effective for cats. Pet parents in Massachusetts often seek chiropractic adjustments for their cats to help improve mobility, relieve stiffness, support post-injury recovery, or reduce chronic pain, especially in older cats or those with musculoskeletal issues. A professional animal chiropractor will conduct a full assessment before beginning any treatment, ensuring it’s appropriate for your cat’s specific condition.

**How much does it cost to take my cat to an animal chiropractor in Massachusetts?**

The cost of feline chiropractic care in Massachusetts typically ranges from $60 to $150 per session, depending on the provider’s experience, session length, and whether it’s an in-home or in-clinic visit. Some chiropractors offer discounts for multiple sessions or follow-up packages. It’s best to ask if the chiropractor offers a consultation fee or includes an initial assessment in the first visit’s cost.
