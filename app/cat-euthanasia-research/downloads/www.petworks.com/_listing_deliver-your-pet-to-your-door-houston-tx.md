Amazing! We thought we had lost our cat while traveling but after 4 days the hotel called asking if we owned a cat. Needless to say, the hotel was not to pleased with having a cat left in the room and they wanted the cat GONE. I attempted to contact several companies but when I contacted DeAudrey, she basically dropped everything and her top priority was to save the cat. She left that night, driving all night. Upon arrival at the hotel the staff had not captured the cat so she was on her own to search the room. Finally she found her, gave her food, water and cat box break and she was on the road.   
I was connected to an app where I could monitor her progress as she drove to our home. She would text me as well as sending pictures of their travels.

I have nothing but good things to say about DeAudrey. She is reliable, dependable and professional.

If you need to transport a pet you need to contact DeAudrey FIRST. 

Thank you DeAudrey!

Everything was great! DeAudrey was very prompt and communicated / sent updates the entire time. She stopped multiple times to let our puppy use the bathroom and gave me access to track her so I could keep an eye on when their arrival would be. I highly recommend - 10/10 stars!! Thank you, DeAudrey!
