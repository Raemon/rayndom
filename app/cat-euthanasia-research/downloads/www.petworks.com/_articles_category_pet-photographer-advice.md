# How to Photograph a Black Dog

If you own a black dog, you undoubtedly have some of those photos. The ones that look like a big black blob on the couch with a tiny pink tongue sticking out or the bearskin rug on the floor. Photographing a large dark colored dog is difficult . If your dog has thick hair to the face area (e.g. Newfoundlands), it seems to be nearly impossible. Fear not. Mindy Dutka, a professional pet photographer and owner of Dogs I Meet ([dogsimeet.com](https://dogsimeet.com/)), offers some tips on taking photos to capture the true beauty of black dogs.

### **Set The Tone**

To start, set the tone. Mindy suggests spending some time with your dog, conditioning him or her to the camera or iPhone. You want picture taking time to signal fun and treats for your dog. You can play a game sitting next to your dog, snap a picture then give your dog praise and a treat. After a few times of sitting with your dog, ask him/her to stay and you move back and take a photo. Let your dog hold the stay and you move to where your dog is and give him/her a treat. (You do not want your dog to come to you for the treat – that will condition the dog to always walk up to you when they see you trying to take a photo.)

****

### **Lighting is Everything**

Next, lighting is everything. But the type and intensity are important. “Dark fur absorbs all the light. Outside lighting is better,” Mindy said. “Early in the morning or an hour before sunset are the optimal times. Try to avoid photographing midday when the sun is its brightest and harshest. You want “open shade,” not bright, harsh light. It’s also better not to use a flash, as that can reflect off the fur. ”

### **Eyes Facing a Light Source**

Now that you have good lighting, The most important tip is having your dog’s eyes facing a light source to catch the light in their eyes. Focusing on the eyes captures the spirit and essence of the dog.

### **How To Photograph A Black Dog. Keep Your Dog Stationary!**

It’s also important to keep your dog stationary, while you move your position to the best spot. You may have to move a few times to catch the right angle to capture the light in your dog’s eyes.

### ****  
**  
Get Down on the Dog’s Level**.

If your dog is laying down, get close to the ground for the photo. Ideally, you want the camera to be at the same level as the dog. Another good angle is to have the dog look up at you, again focusing on the eyes.

### **Select Background Colors that are Yellow, Light Blue and Green**

Try to select background colors that are in the yellow, light blue and green shades. You don’t want a busy background, as you want your dog to be the star of the photo. Using portrait mode on your Iphone can bring your photography skills into a different whole new level. This is because the portrait mode usually creates a bokeh or blurry background which makes your black dog stand out.

### **So Here’s How To Photograph A Black Dog. Practice!**

Most importantly, practice! [Dog Photography](https://www.petworks.com/hire/pet-photographers) is a lot of trial and error. Fortunately, it costs nothing to take as many photos using your phone as you want and deleting the less-than-perfect ones is just a click away.

# The Creative Process of a Pet Photographer

As a photographer and lover of all things fuzzy, I’ve always loved combining the two through [pet photography](https://www.petworks.com/hire/pet-photographers). One of the first things I trained my cat to do was model. It helps if your model is food-motivated, and lucky for me, my cat Toad is practically food-_obsessed_.
