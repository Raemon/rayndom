#### How did you hone your craft?

I began my professional career as published author in 2001 after attending Penn State University undergrad in Psychology. I had an innate drive to support others in heartbreak by forming support groups for controlled substance addiction/recovery getting certified as a recovery and grief specialist. When my 1st pet's health declined and passed I felt a deep sense of loss.

I took my passion by gaining my certification as a Pet Loss Specialist and love the work I continue to do everyday.

Build a Strong Bond: Consistent, gentle interaction, patience, and regular, positive interactions are crucial to developing a strong, trusting relationship with your pet.

Honoring the memory of family pets and the legacy they left behind has been a deeply fulfilling aspect of my work for the past 16 years. My empathy and sincereity allows individuals to contribute to the memory and legacy of their beloved companions. These reasons highlight the joy and fulfillment that comes from supporting families through the loss of their pets, making it a career choice that is both meaningful and impactful. Noone can feel what another person feels from loss of their own pet; but I have experienced pet heartbreak in my life and understand how difficult it is to loose a beloved family companion.
