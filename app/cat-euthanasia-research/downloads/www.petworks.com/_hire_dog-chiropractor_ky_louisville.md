**AMA**

**What does a dog chiropractor do, and how can chiropractic care help my dog?**

A dog chiropractor focuses on the alignment of your dog’s spine and musculoskeletal system. By performing gentle, manual adjustments, a certified animal chiropractor can help relieve pain, improve mobility, support nervous system function, and address issues like limping, stiffness, or difficulty jumping. Chiropractic care in Louisville, KY is often used for dogs recovering from injury, aging pets with arthritis, and active or athletic dogs under physical strain.

**Is chiropractic care safe for dogs?**

Yes. When performed by a licensed and certified animal chiropractor, chiropractic care in Louisville is considered safe and effective. Certified practitioners typically hold a degree in veterinary medicine or human chiropractic and have completed additional training in animal chiropractic. Always ensure your provider is accredited by organizations like the American Veterinary Chiropractic Association (AVCA) or the International Veterinary Chiropractic Association (IVCA).

**What are some local towns and cities with dog chiropractors near me?**

Jefferson County, Jeffersonville, New Albany, Clarksville, Shelbyville, Shepherdsville, La Grange, Corydon, Bardstown, Madison, Radcliff

**How much does a session with a dog chiropractor cost?**

Fees generally range from $60 to $150 per session, depending on the practitioner’s credentials, location, and whether it's an initial evaluation or a follow-up adjustment. Some chiropractors in Louisville, Kentucky offer package rates for ongoing care or provide mobile services, which may influence pricing.
