# Desert Shadows Animal Chiropractic Care - Phoenix, AZ

(4 reviews)

Member since Jan 2020 

For your animal to stay healthy, they need proper care of their muscles and joints. Any type of stress, may it be physical or emotional can result in the defensive posture of muscle contracts, locking of spinal joints, and other problems in the nervous system that, if not treated in a given time, may result in pain and nerve problems for the animal. Some common symptoms that signal such problems are signs of pain and unevenness of gait, but with proper chiropractic care, the stress areas can be targeted and worked on which will result in a more flexible and healthier pet. 

Chiropractic for Horses:   
This animal, because of its immense workload, usually falls victim to nerve diseases and muscle impairment and that’s why extra attention is needed when dealing with horses. Horses with Vertebral Subluxation Complex (VSCs) show many symptoms like back pain being the most common one of them. Horses with back pain refuse to work, and their stance also shows signs of pain.

Chiropractic for Dogs:   
In the case of dogs, it is not necessary that the dog needs to be old to experience back and neck problems. Chiropractics of dogs has proved to have significant changes in their gait troubles and muscle pains and resulted in avoiding many surgeries thus provided a longer lifespan. 

And of course, if you want the [best animal chiropractic care](https://www.petworks.com/hire/animal-chiropractic/) anywhere in the United States, we highly recommend Petworks!

We cannot recommend Dr. Campo enough. My dog has IVDD and she has shown remarkable improvement after all 3 visits. She stopped panting all the time, stopped spinning in circles, can sleep through the night, and is getting back to all her activities. He gave us a quick massage to at home with stretches to help her to improve quicker. It started with my dog showing signs she was in pain, we took her to the emergency vet which suggested maybe it was her kidneys. She kept getting worse. Her vet was stumped and said we needed another opinion. We took her to another emergency vet who said the issue was with her spine but would take a 5-7k MRI to figure out what is wrong plus surgery if it is something like a herniated disc. She is 12 so the cost of it all plus the surgery was unrealistic. They also said she probably had dementia which was causing the circles she was doing but it was all just because of her pain levels.

Such a great experience. Dr. Campo was amazing working with our dog Benji. He explained everything that was going on and made sure we understood the process of what was going to happen with Benji. He was patient with Benji and very understanding of the pain he was in. We are so thankful for his help and will definitely be back :-).

Love love love! Can't recommend them enough! Started with my fur baby and now our whole family and my best friend go here. I was feeling immediate relief after only 2 adjustments! Every person is different but Dr. Campos definitely knows what he's doing and he discusses everything with you.

We're very happy with the work Dr Campo did with our dog, Jupiter. His back leg joints were very painful, he could barely walk, we were told by the emergency vet that maybe a disc or neurological problem could require surgery. We opted for Dr Campo's chiropractic adjustments and our dog saw an immediate relief - his pain was gone within 2 weeks and he is walking normally again. I know this could be a regular issue for our dog due to his breed, so we will be repeat clients. Highly recommended!
