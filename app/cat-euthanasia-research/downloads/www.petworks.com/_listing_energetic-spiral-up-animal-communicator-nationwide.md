# Energetic Spiral Up - Animal Communicator - Nationwide

(14 reviews)

Verified Member since Jan 2020 

I am a master energy healer certified in several modalities. I connect with the animal's higher self and communicate telepathically with them. When working with a sick or injured animal, I identify and eliminate the underlying influences that cause imbalances in their energy restoring them to a neutral place of overall wellness. Most animals are very open and eager to communicate. They respond well to energy shifting and balancing. Please contact and book me through Petworks. Have a great day!

## Customer Reviews

Everything went wonderfully thank you very much

**\- Lori P**

Terry is absolutely amazing! Highly recommend!!! I have done 2 sessions with her and everything has been spot on! 

**\- Jessica S**

Terry called exactly at the time she scheduled. She seemed very nice and easy to speak with..   
I’m hoping that all she did to align him is successful , time will tell.   
Thank you Terry!

**\- Debbie A**

Beautifully, Bells issues were addressed. We are very thankful for Terry's gift of knowledge and healing. We give Terry a 10+rating

**\- Lori P**

Terry was very helpful and reassuring regarding my cat Donnie's serious illness and recent euthanasia. I felt supported and validated. It was so nice to communicate with my kitty Donnie (and my other deceased cat!) in the spirit world and know they are both doing so well and free from pain. 

**\- Aileen H**

Very smooth. Tucker seems to have enjoyed it. Thank you!

**\- Liz A**

Everything went great! Terry was prompt and on time. My dog appeared very receptive to her even tho he was a bit shy she addressed all the issues he had. He was a visibly happier and more energetic pup after the call❤️ it was a very positive experience 

**\- Tricia C**

Terry was very professional and lovely to work with! Communication before the session was prompt and she was flexible with rescheduling with me.   
She warm and lovely while we talked with our Dog. I would not hesitate to book again.

**\- Judith N**

I did not feel like this experience validated communication with my animal. Most things were just off, it was disappointing. 

**\- Chelsea N**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

Hi Chelsea. I understand your disappointment regarding our session with Colt. He was still under the influence of the medication, which significantly impacted communication clarity, and I’m deeply sorry the experience did not meet your expectation. It was an honor to support Colt energetically to clear that fogginess and assist him to move forward in his transition. I hold space for your grief, and wish you comfort and gentle memories of your beloved Colt."
