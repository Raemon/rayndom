# Micky Doyle - Licensed Animal Chiropractor - Reno, NV

Member since Jan 2020 

Hey there! I am a licensed animal chiropractor of 15 years. I use safe, gentle, effective adjustments with complementary muscle work and stretching techniques that benefit your animal for a wide range of musculoskeletal and motion abnormalities and pain. Dr. Micky Doyle was born and raised in Carson City, Nevada. He attended Life West Chiropractic College in Hayward California and graduated Magna Cum Laude in 2000. Dr. Micky practiced in the Bay Area for a couple of years and decided to return home to Nevada in 2004. He currently lives with his family in the Spanish Springs area of Sparks. On days that he is not adjusting animals, he practices on our two-legged, not-so-furry friends at Doyle Chiropractic located in the Chiropractic Health Center, 294 E. Moana Lane, Reno. Be sure to ask for an appointment with Dr. Micky!

Dr. Micky is certified as an Animal Chiropractor by American Veterinary Chiropractic Association (AVCA) and Nevada Veterinary Board of Medical Examiners. The AVCA is an organization made up of Doctors of Chiropractic and Veterinary medicine. Certified doctors have advanced studies in animal chiropractic care and have passed proficiency exams. 

Please contact and book me on Petworks. Thanks.
