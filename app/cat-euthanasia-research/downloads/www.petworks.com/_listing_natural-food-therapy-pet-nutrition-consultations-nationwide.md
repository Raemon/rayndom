# Natural Food Therapy - Pet Nutrition Consultations - Nationwide

(3 reviews)

Verified Member since Apr 2024 

I help pets feel better with tailored homemade diets, herbs, and mushrooms—especially when they struggle with appetite, digestion, or chronic illness. Virtual and Seattle-area consults available.

I’m Yuki Konno, a licensed veterinary technician since 2011 and a certified practitioner of veterinary western herbal medicine. After over a decade in emergency and specialty hospitals, I saw firsthand how many pets continued to suffer despite conventional treatments. That’s why I created Food Medicine for Animals—a service rooted in both science and nature.

Using your pet’s medical history, lab work, lifestyle, and current diet, I create fully customized food therapy plans that include nourishing homemade recipes, medicinal mushrooms, and gentle herbs to support healing. My goal is to restore vitality, improve quality of life, and give pet parents peace of mind—especially when nothing else seems to work.

I work virtually with clients across the U.S., and provide in-home consultations for those in the greater Seattle area. Many clients say they finally feel seen, understood, and supported in their pet care journey. You can read their stories at foodmedicineforanimals.com.

If you're ready to give your dog or cat a personalized, natural path to healing, I’d love to help.

## Customer Reviews

I am really grateful for all the help that Yuki gave to me and my dog Rosie. She was diagnosed with pancreatitis and they told me to feed her Hills prescription digestive care ID food. My dog ate that food for 8 months and she will have episodes of vomiting with blood and diarrhea with blood. Also, she was so skinny and not getting better. I realized that food was not helping my dog to get better. I was really desperate praying to God to help me find a nutritionist. Doing a lot of search I found Yuki. she is a blessing form the sky. All the natural foods its being helping my dog to get better and better. I feel she is gaining weight and her stool is back to normal she is not throwing up blood any more. I really recommended Yuki. She was really patience with me and always heard my concerns and gave me answers to all my questions. Thank you Yuki. Rosie and I appreciate all your help.

**\- Alexandra S**

Yuki is so knowledgeable, helpful and friendly. She tailored three different protein-based gently cooked diets for our four cats with differing tastes for me to make with my own sustainably sourced, organic meats and appropriate produce, along with the proper supplements, giving them as close to a natural diet as possible. As they adjust to the changes, I can slowly move them into some raw elements if they show interest.   
She’s great to work with, answers my questions and offered many suggestions.   
It’s nice knowing she’ll also be available if future needs arise. I highly recommend her.
