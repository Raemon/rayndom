### [Jody L. Teiche - Pet Health Coach - Certified Nutritionist - Nationwide](/en/listing/507493) by [Jody Teiche](/en/user/jodymilleryoung)

Nutrition Consult

$175 Per 60 Minutes 

If you're unsure about what you're feeding or what to believe online, or if your dog or cat are having health issues, a nutrition consult could be very helpful in starting to solve or completely solving the problem. We will go over your pet's diet, supplements, any symptoms you're noticing and I'll work with you to create a nutrition plan that is designed to create more energy, youthfulness and good health.   
Client testimonial: “My dog has never been healthier! I am so incredibly grateful for Jody. My sweet Mia is an 11-year-old Maltipoo. She had been struggling for the last few years with inconsistent bowels, blood in stools, hacking and coughing, bouts of not eating, vomiting bile and regurgitating food. I spent thousands of dollars over the years trying different food, different medications, vet visits and even a dog cardiologist.   
I found Jody and she has completely changed our lives. Its been a year now, and Mia hasn’t had any blood in her stools and has not thrown up yellow bile. This is the longest time she was a puppy that she hasn’t had some sort of stomach/bowel issue. I HIGHLY recommend Jody.” – Chloe C.

Homeopathy Consult

$350 Per 90 Minutes 

If your pet has specific issues that are acute or chronic, homeopathy can be very effective. I will take your pet's case, where you'll describe their symptoms, we'll go over their history and I'll recommend a homeopathic remedy, teach you how to use, what to look for and create a plan moving forward. We will have follow up consults so I can see how things are going and what you are observing. Those follow up consults are $2.50 a minute and usually last between 10 - 30 minutes. We will work together until we have achieved our goals.
