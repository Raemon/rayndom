## Customer Reviews

Dr. Marnell has been great! Our dog is a 15 year old American Eskimo. She started having mobility problems with her back legs, causing her to be less active and happy. We took her to our vet and they said that this was normal for a dog of her age and prescribed her Carprofen (to reduce pain & inflammation). The pills helped and she seemed to feel better while on them. When we tried to gradually stop she would go back to looking uncomfortable, not as energetic, tail down, etc. We did some research for animal chiropractors and found Dr. Marnell. He's been treating Maggie on and off for a few months now, and during this time she hasn't needed pain pills anymore. He's from Phoenix but meets us at a park by our house in Scottsdale. He is also able to meet us in the mornings before we go to work during the week. This makes it very convenient for us and we really appreciate him working with our schedule. - Scottsdale, Arizona

Dr. Marnell is awesome! Our dog did not want to walk. He cried when we picked him up and when he woke up in the morning. His tail was between his legs and his back was arched. After a couple of days of this behavior, I brought Milo to see Dr. Marnell. Immediately after the first treatment, Milo's tail was wagging back and forth. He walked normally to the car and jumped in. He seems to be completely back to normal. So happy we brought Milo to Dr. Marnell. He's a nice man and does a great job! - Eden Prairie, MN

Dr. Marnell has been doing a great job of treating our small dog using animal chiropractic. We began seeing Dr. Marnell after our dog, Doodle, had two torn cruciate ligaments repaired surgically. Doodle did well with the surgeries and recoveries until he fell off a small stone wall in our yard. After the fall, Doodle wasn't himself. He didn't want to play and he wasn't cuddly anymore. We didn't want to go through any more traumatic surgeries and it seemed hopeful that whatever had happened in the fall could be fixed using less invasive methods. Therefore, we decided to try animal chiropractic and called Dr. Marnell. Dr. Marnell saw Doodle the next day. He arranged to meet in a park, where we were able to social distance and be outside while he worked with Doodle. While Doodle wasńt too sure what he thought about the adjustment process, it was clear that he liked Dr. Marnell. More important, it was evident that Dr. Marnell´s work made an immediate difference in how he felt. The afternoon of the first adjustment, Doodle was asking to come up on the couch, he was engaging in a way he hadn't since the fall, and he generally seemed more playful and happier. We have now had four visits with Dr. Marnell. We saw a huge difference after the first session, improvements continued after the second and third session, and after the fourth session, Doodle brought me a ball and asked to play. Doodle was a rescue so wére not sure of his age, but he is somewhere between 11-13. He hasn't asked to play with a ball for several years, certainly since before his surgeries. Our experience with Dr. Marnell has been fantastic. He is straight forward, honest, and effective. I highly recommend giving Animal Chiropractic a try if it is appropriate for whatever issues your animal is having - and I highly recommend Dr. Marnell as an animal chiropractor. - Paradise Valley, Arizona
