# Remote Viewer - Depth Clairvoyance For Lost Pets - Nationwide

(17 reviews)

Verified Member since May 2025 

**PLEASE read the entire listing carefully before booking with me.**

Please ask all questions related to my services prior to booking, and let me know if you have done all the practical things, such as posting signs, distributing flyers, and engaging any other services you've contracted in your search. I want to make the booked time efficient and focused on locating your pet. Thank you.

This type of work is not for everyone. It does not always end in a reunion. This is applied intuitive perception, used within clear limits, verified against reality, and conducted with respect for personal, emotional, and ethical boundaries. If you have read my listing, asked all of your questions, are satisfied with the answers, and book the service(s), you are stating you understand the scope of this type of work. I have a no-games, no-nonsense approach. I do not feel the need to provide proof or to convince anyone. With over 900 animal searches to date and supporting feedback, the work speaks for itself.

**I find pets worldwide, remotely, using remote viewing/perception skills and depth clairvoyance.**

A note on dowsing: I have been dowsing for over 40 years and use this in my healing practice and to supplement my remote viewing impressions. I am often asked to dowse specific questions. I will do this if appropriate and within limits. This can cross into "predictive" territory; I intentionally avoid predictive, new age practices.

I'm a professionally trained remote viewer, trained by some of the best RV teachers in the world: Arvari, Birdie Jaworski, and currently studying with Ronan. I combine my lifelong clair abilities - clairvoyance being particularly strong and extremely detailed - with various remote viewing/perception methods to provide accurate locators and information about the missing. I have assisted in cold cases, FBI-connected cases, and with other high-level operatives and law enforcement. I assist, on request, with missing persons (including children). I've enjoyed collaborating with renowned lifelong psychic medium Omar Khan on various assignments. I love assisting in operative work. My work is sought out by people in need, via word of mouth, based on real results, from all over the globe in both animal and human cases.

I'm a trained and practiced body worker/energy worker of over three decades. I am committed to the long game of personal healing, parallel to assisting others in healing, through unique intuitive methods, combined knowledge, modalities, and ever-expanding knowledge and intuitive depth.

My partner and I built and own a 160-acre Farm Animal Sanctuary and certified Wildlife Sanctuary, up on a windy ridge in Northern/Central VT. We have stewarded over 750 acres of forest over the past 35 years. I descend from generations of animal lovers, have a lifetime telepathic connection to animals of all kinds, and a deep appreciation for the connections we form with them. I bring all of this into the searches I am part of.

Many successful lost pet outcomes worldwide.

**Educational background:**

Psychology, art therapy, art education, alternative education

M.A. in Healing Arts

Acupressure, Polarity Therapy, Regenesis, Bio-field work

Missing persons and unsolved homicides

Synesthete

My work is grounded in disciplined intuitive perception and verification rather than unexamined channeling or performative authority. Each session is approached methodically, with impressions assessed through pattern recognition, corroboration, and client feedback, while respecting the client’s own discernment and intuitive insights. I do not present intuitive work as infallible; accountability, ethical restraint, and accuracy are central to my practice. The focus is practical clarity and grounded insight, not belief-building or spectacle, and I work best with clients who value thoughtful process, precision, and collaborative engagement.

**Please note: I work on cases from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM four days a week.** I try to make exceptions for weekends and holidays. Not all sessions will produce a successful reunion. While a lot can be transmitted in the 45–60 minute consult, most searches take more time to successfully resolve. Feedback on maps is required as this is a collaborative effort.

Please contact and book me on PetWorks, and we will set up a workable time for both of us. Thanks. 

Consultations and communications are confidential and provided for the client’s private use only. Any recording, reproduction, public dissemination, or use of a session for comparison, critique, or social media content is expressly prohibited. Booking a session with me constitutes acceptance of these terms. Thank You So Much.

#### Pricing Packages

Initial fee consult fee which can be applied to continued booked services

$ 60.00 Per 45 minutes [book](/remote-viewer-depth-clairvoyance-for-lost-pets-nationwide/book?id=8097)

I understand how heartbreaking and stressful it is to have a beloved pet go missing, and my goal is to support you through every step of the search. After our initial 45+ minute consultation (during which I provide initial locators), if you'd then like to continue, my fees are $125 for the first week, which includes five customized maps, ongoing communication to guide your search efforts, additional impressions I receive, and continuous support throughout the process. If the search continues beyond the first week, the fee is $50 per additional week. I want to make sure cost is never a barrier to finding your pet, so I am open to adjusting this fee on a case-by-case basis.

## Customer Reviews

Cris was absolutely amazing and went above and beyond by helping me on Christmas day and even talking with me longer than our scheduled appointment slot. Not only was she able to help me locate my cat through her skills in remote viewing, but she also explained her process to me and gave me tips, which was very reassuring. Contacting Cris was a last resort in searching for my cat, but I am so glad I did. I am extremely grateful to say I have found my cat after a week. Thanks again Cris!

**\- Michelle D**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

Thanks very much, Michelle. Always a pleasure to be able to help. Happy things resolved in a timely manner for you.

**\- Cris Pryce**

Everything is going well with cris, very good experience 

**\- Serge L**

With immense gratitude, I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to Gary Cochran, Calvin Willard, and Cris Pryce for their incredible assistance during a challenging time for our furry friends. On Tuesday evening, our beloved Beagle, Slater, found refuge at Gary's house. As an elderly dog with sore hips and paws, this act of kindness meant the world to us. Similarly, on Wednesday afternoon, our resilient three-legged Australian Shepherd, Oso, made his way to the Willard's home – a really steep hike uphill for a three legged dog after 3 days. The power of prayer and collective efforts played a significant role in bringing our pups to safety. I truly believe that without the remarkable assistance of Cris Pryce, a clairvoyant with a heart of gold, our dogs might still be navigating the challenges of the weather. Cris utilized her unique skills to remote view and ensure their safety, providing us with hope that ultimately led to their safe return. Your kindness, compassion, and commitment to the well-being of our pets have left us profoundly grateful. Thank you, Gary, Calvin, and Cris, for going above and beyond. We also hope that our adventurous dogs have learned a valuable lesson about wandering in unpredictable weather. With heartfelt thanks, The Layn Family - Peacham, Vermont

**\- Jen L**

Things went wonderful, she was so kind and empathic. Additionally, her clarity and intuition is spot on and super helpful in such a stressful a situation. I would highly recommend Cris if you are needed to locate your lost pet. 

**\- Delaine S**

A good person with the heart of an angel .   
A big thank you for cris help to find roxi.   
Hopefully soon home

**\- Serge L**

Losing our pet Cely has been really tough, especially since we're new to the area, but Cris has been absolutely amazing! For the past three months, she's been helping us by providing locaters that have given us leads on where Cely has been spotted. Even though Cely isn't home yet, Cris has been a constant support, and we're so grateful for her help. I would definitely recommend Cris to anyone who's trying to find their missing pet. Thanks, Cris, you've been great!

**\- Daniela G**

Amazing experience, very honest, attentive and accurate description to my neighborhood. which has many unusual features, yet her description was amazing. Exceptional talent! Thank you Cris!

**\- Dalia A**

Gratitude! During the six days we looked for our orange cat, Alis, we worked closely with Cris Pryce of Calais. Although she never came to Stowe, Cris saw things that led us to the precise location of Alis in a storm drain. First, she determined that Alis was alive. Then she directed us precisely to a house up the street as a locator, and from there we walked the edge of the road toward our house. Just by chance we looked down to the storm drain where she was forlornly sitting. We had looked in other storm drains on the street but not this one. Cris is compassionate and incredibly intuitive. If you ever lose track of a beloved pet, contact her. We are so grateful to her. - Stowe, Vermont

**\- Karen G**

Found! Buster Brown Our Adventuring & Beloved Beagle! The biggest thanks is to Cris Pryce, the remote viewing specialist who was recommend to us. Her mappings, visuals, colors, landmarks gave us places to search and hope. She truly kept our hope alive and she knew he was still out there and searching for us - protected by a big angel (the photo of her mapping is included here). We exchanged over 50 emails in the last few weeks - and countless phone calls. And she does this work gratis. She was an incredible partner in searching for our baby. Take a look at her mapping from yesterday included here. The house where he was found has a dark blue/green door, pretty yellow light coming from a lot of windows, a driveway that rounds around the house (almost their own cul-de-sac) and she was clear that it was a new location from the prior day, and that the family was home. She also said his nose was to the ground, he was looping to find us (his nose is scraped raw!). Her earlier maps (on the bitter cold days) had him hunkered down in or under sheds and barns (and we found multiple evidences of 'nests' where he was hiding in the Hollow). She also would tell me when he was warm, safe in a hiding spot, or was feeling depleted, or hurt. The comfort she gave me, is hard to even explain. If you're ever missing your fur baby, you need to call Cris. - Stowe, Vermont

**\- Erin D**

Excellent job mapping the site where my pup might be. We have not found her yet; but, Cris has an amazing gift! 

**\- Sandy P**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

Thank you, Sandy Sometimes the outcome is heartbreaking. This was one of those times Peace and healing.

**\- Cris Pryce**

Working with Cris was great!   
She gave me lots of good information and locators to help me find my dog.   
I have yet to find her but I’m confident that with her locators I can narrow it down, and will be able to bring her home.

**\- Tyler R**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

Thank you very much, I appreciate the feedback.

**\- Cris Pryce**

Loved talking with Cris! I'm so glad I got in touch with her!

**\- Cris Pryce**

Cris is an amazing human being with a heart of Gold and she does not do this service to just make monetary gain, but to genuinely help people find their lost pets with her special abilities. Most people/remote viewers on this site require you to send your address to use google maps and even send a picture of your pet, but Cris perfectly described my location and cat without knowing either. She is the real deal. I had two sessions with her and she led me to the location of my cat and I felt his presence in those locations she suggested. I was unable to get him at those locations, but that led him to following my scent back home.   
Cris was instrumental with not only in finding my cat, but with helping me stay positive and giving me hope through the process. If you are reading this then you lost your pet, and I’m urging you for your own benefit to use Cris. She is a special human being and is full of love and empathy for others and uses her gift and abilities for good. Thank you so much Cris! I’m so thankful to God that he led me to you, a true earth angel!

Thank you for your time. 

**\- Evony H**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

You're welcome, it was my pleasure helping you.

**\- Cris Pryce**

Cris went above and beyond what was described in her services when my cat went missing. She took the time to understand the full story, shared detailed impressions of his surroundings and behavior, and even emailed me her notes with drawings of what she visualized. Her insight and compassion gave me real peace of mind that he was alive and nearby. While she didn’t directly lead me to him, her accuracy and support gave me hope. A few hours later, a neighbor spotted him exactly as she’d described. I’m so grateful for her kindness and care during such a stressful time.
