**AMA: Pet Transport Services in New York City, NY (New York County)**

**What types of pet transport services are available to and from New York City, NY?**

Many services can be coordinated remotely through the PetWorks platform, so you can manage details, upload medical info, and receive updates from anywhere.

**How much does pet transport cost in 2026?**

Local trips (within New York City/New York County): $50 – $150 : one-way, ground transport

Regional trips (~300 miles): $150 – $400 : includes in-transit care & updates

Nationwide trips (ground or coordinated air transport): $400 – $1,200+ : full-service door-to-door

Senior, special needs, or medical transport: $500 – $1,500+ : extra attention and equipment

Providers offer custom quotes based on your pet’s size, needs, and distance. Always ask about insurance, travel updates, and emergency protocols.
