[Pet physical therapy](https://www.petworks.com/hire/pet-physical-therapy) offers a wide range of benefits, improving both the health and quality of life for dogs, cats, and other animals. One of the primary advantages is pain relief. Through techniques like massage, joint mobilization, and hydrotherapy, physical therapy can alleviate discomfort from arthritis, injuries, or post-surgery recovery. These methods enhance circulation, reduce inflammation, and promote healing without the need for heavy medication.

Another key benefit is improved mobility. Pets with degenerative conditions, spinal issues, or muscle weakness can regain strength and coordination through targeted exercises. This helps them maintain their independence, allowing them to move more freely, jump, run, and play without struggling. Improved mobility also reduces the risk of further injuries that can occur due to stiff joints or weakened muscles.

Physical therapy can also enhance an animal’s overall fitness and weight management. For overweight pets or those with metabolic conditions, customized exercises can burn calories and build muscle. This not only helps manage their weight but also improves cardiovascular health, extending their lifespan and energy levels.

In addition, physical therapy offers emotional benefits. Pets who have been in pain or immobile may experience frustration or anxiety. Regular therapy sessions provide positive mental stimulation, improve mood, and reduce stress. The hands-on approach of a therapist builds trust and comfort between the pet and practitioner, creating a calming environment.

Pet physical therapy offers a holistic approach to managing pain, improving movement, boosting fitness, and providing emotional relief, all while enhancing a pet’s quality of life.

# Mobility Tips for Senior Pets

Senior Pets. Mobility issues are the most common of all problems reported to us by dog owners. At least 50% of our patients struggle with some level of mobility difficulty. By a wide margin, the number-one reported ailment from pet owners in my line of work, which is veterinary hospice care, is that their pet is having difficulty with mobility. These issues range from struggling to stand, splaying while at their food bowl, or, in some cases, the complete inability to walk. Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of mobility issues in geriatric pets, but soft tissue injuries, disc disorders, stenosis, and neuropathy also could be the root of the issue.

# 6 Ways to Take Care of Your Horse During the Heat of Summer

_by Sandra Burnett, RN & Independent BEMER Distributor._

No matter where in the United States you live, summer days can sometimes be excruciatingly hot. And while fun in the sun is great for humans, it can be deadly for horses if you aren’t vigilant about their welfare. Your horse’s skin contains sweat glands that help keep him cool. As the horse heats up, capillaries in the skin dilate to expel the heat generated by the muscles. When the capillaries can no longer keep up, the horse starts to sweat, which helps to release the heat. [(more…)](https://www.petworks.com/articles/horse-care-summer-heat/#more-2199)
