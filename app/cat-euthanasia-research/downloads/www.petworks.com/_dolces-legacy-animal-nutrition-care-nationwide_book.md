### [Dolce’s Legacy - Animal Nutrition Care - Nationwide](/en/listing/509033) by [Bronwyn Farley](/en/user/dolceslegacy)

2 Hr Consultation for Oncology

$210 Per 60 Minutes 

1 - 2 Hour Consultations are 210$ I’m usually booked out 2 weeks in advanced. Cancer and other serious conditions skip to the head of the line will take about 2.5 hours. Weeks can be precious wasted time that they don’t have an excess of. We certainly won’t be wasting it waiting on me to clear out my schedule!

One thing you will never purchase from me is a “RECIPE”. I absolutely refuse to sell a “diet” or “recipe” that conforms to the masses. I will not refund a consultation fee after I’ve spent the hour with you. YOU will be required to take notes for our consultation, (most consultations run over on time so be sure to allow this in your schedule) please be prepared.

We work with the animal in front of us! What does this body specifically require? We are individuals and have our own nutritional needs… they do too!

First and foremost this Hour belongs to you! So please don’t feel like this is just to hear me ramble on about nutrition. I want this hour to be tailored to your needs. More to the point your canine and feline’s needs. Don’t know what to ask? That’s ok I’m here for it and happy to take over the discussion so that we can touch base on finer key points. Most consultations do run over the 1 hour mark, so make sure you’ve allotted an appropriate amount of time for us. I DO NOT work just the one pet, I work the entire household. It does us no good to change how we feed a dog (example) with Pancreatic flairs, and not correct how we feed the whole house. I educate us on being reactive towards body A with said condition and proactive with body B.

So often many of my clients come to me after they’ve received the one diagnosis none of us ever want to hear… “CANCER”… My Goal, is redefining the way we “Live” with Cancer. Cancer does not define us!

In our cancer consultations, we take a comprehensive approach to support your dog's health, focusing on food therapy and energetics tailored to their specific requirements. Our discussions include crucial dietary elements that should be incorporated, as well as foods to avoid entirely, ensuring that your dog receives the best possible nutritional support throughout their journey.

We emphasize the importance of flushing the lymphatic system, which plays a vital role in maintaining overall health and wellness. Additionally, we explore homeopathy and herbal modalities that are specifically designed to meet your dog's unique needs, fostering a holistic nurturing environment.
