# Pet Loss and Grief Counseling and Coaching - Nationwide

(19 reviews)

Verified Member since Dec 2023 

When an animal transitions out of the body, or is preparing to do so, many questions arise. Talking to someone who communicates with animals who have crossed over, or who are preparing to cross over, gives you clarity and ease in a troubled time. 

Talking to a trained counselor to help you with your grief, allows you to find peace in a time of heart ache.

Because of my background as an LMFT/PhD grief counselor, my coaching can help soothe your heart. As an animal intuitive and human intuitive, I let you know the experience your animal is having so you can navigate without fear. 

Dr Laurie Moore, author, key note speaker and Satsang- seminar leader for over two decades has appeared in over a hundred venues including CNN.com, Fox New, CBS top radio, Beyond the Ordinary, BatGap, Alara Canfield, Species Link, BatGap and many more. She values all people and animals with heart to heart listening.

Pokey and I have been working with Dr Laurie for 3 years and it wasn’t until tonight when an emergency arose that we understood the extreme importance of Dr Laurie in our Lives. Without hesitation she was there for us when we were having crisis. We put out an emergency message, and within minutes Dr Laurie was by our sides offering words of hope, encouragement, understanding, love, and power to bring back what we had lost. The night continued and she never left our side. Pokey was lost and she found him and bought him back to me and back to Pokey himself. We will be forever Grateful for the Spirit of Dr Laurie and her cats. She is sincere honest and beautiful in every way The Universe has to offer.

**\- Angie B**

Beautiful session. Very light, playful, intuitive and affirmative .. I really enjoyed.. thank you.

**\- Patrick G**

We had a great session with Dr. Moore. It was extremely helpful knowing what was going on emotionally with my dog, who is recovering from illness...and learning what he needs from his humans.

**\- Barbara Z**

Laurie Moore has a depth and breadth of experience as a therapist, psychic and light worker that is hard to find. I trust her heart completely. She has helped me immensely, and understands the hazards of being a planetary helper. Also she talks to the animal kingdom. I’m very happy I found her.

**\- Susan B**

Everything was great thank you so much!

**\- Susie H**

I love Dr Laurie Moore, and have been a client for more than 15 years. Her heart and soul are so pure and her consistent track record of amazing messages, communication and insight is always spot on. She has helped my fur babies and I through a lot over the years. We don't know what we would do without her! She is so well connected, positive and joyful. Just speaking with her brightens any day let alone her insight. I love that she is always evolving and growing to meet the needs of the universe. I cannot say enough kind words about her. I will always be one of her #1 cheerleaders!

**\- April L**

I was very impressed by how quickly and kindly Dr. Laurie responded to my inquiry even though it was not directly related to her standard services. She was enormously helpful to me. She was able to connect with my loved ones extremely quickly, almost instantly and with very little background from me, in some cases without me even mentioning their name or location or anything. All of her insights really rang true for me, and brought me great relief, resolving some major concerns that had been really weighing me down for over a year and a half, and some more recent concerns as well. I felt an enormous weight lifted off my shoulders, and the connection she was able to make for me with my loved one brought me so much peace and joy. I am so grateful that I found her and grateful for her service.

**\- S I**

A remarkably kind, empathic, and caring practitioner who never fails to deliver work that is very powerful, and on point. Thank you Laurie!

**\- James W**

What a blessing it was to receive a prayer session from Laurie! She immediately tuned into what was needed and artfully channeled prayer intentions that resonated at my core. The energy shifted through my heart and upper chakras with a beautiful release at my throat. By the end of the session, I felt a deep sense of peace, joy and confidence that all is already manifest and aligned with the highest expression of my being.

**\- Marcelle C**

Short but sweet session that pointed me in a more hopeful direction with the added bonus of some exercises to implement.

**\- Ivette L**

I was very nervous the whole day and was not prepared. Some advice write down your questions because the moment I heard my beloved Pepe (chihuahua) that had to be put to sleep was right there with me I just started blubbering lol. The session was fantastic! In 5 minutes she connected me with my dog that had passed, my moms dog that also passed and the current dog I have. Thank you so much for doing what you do. Was a fantastic experience!

**\- S W**

My experience with Dr. Laurie left me happy and inspired. She is such a kind and sweet person. She let me know how my pets are doing and how they experience our family dynamics. She let me know that they’re needs are being met and answered questions I had. It was very illuminating and so nice to be able to get direct info for my sweet cat and dog.

**\- Maggie S**

After having an animal reading for my horse Pinto - Dr. Laurie helped me understand why this special horse has come to me. She also confirmed that she is a special gift that has come to help my heart specifically. I found Dr. Laurie to be genuine and comfortable for me to work with. I noticed the horse immediately connected even more to me (which i thought wasn't possible as she is very connected to me already prior to the reading). Dr. Laurie can help your partnership with your pet.
