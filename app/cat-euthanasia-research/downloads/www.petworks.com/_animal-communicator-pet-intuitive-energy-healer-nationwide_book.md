Heart-to-Heart Connection – 30-Minute Session

$77 Per 30 Minutes 

Animals have a soul too. They deserve understanding and support to address their human concerns. A focused intuitive session that helps you understand your pet on a deeper emotional and energetic level. I connect with your animal’s spirit to explore the root of behaviors, feelings, or changes you’ve noticed — revealing their needs, thoughts, and the love they want to share.   
This session brings gentle clarity and peace for both you and your companion, strengthening your bond and helping you communicate with more empathy and understanding.   
✨ Ideal for first-time animal communication or when you need quick insight and guidance.
