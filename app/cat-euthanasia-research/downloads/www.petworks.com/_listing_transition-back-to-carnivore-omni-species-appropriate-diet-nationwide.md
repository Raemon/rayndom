Food aggression? Anxiety? Nervous? Medical fear? Handicap? Lethargic? We turn your GI illness animal or dangerous animal around to normalcy, happiness, and safety around other animals and people of all ages! See our book called Introducing OSCAR Therapy, sold everywhere. We also teach interns/apprentice therapists and trainers in the FOOLPROOF OSCAR Therapy approach. No matter your animal's location on the planet, we can help your friend with your help - over live-streaming video sessions in real-time!

Based on my 14 years on Boston's New England Aquarium vet team, serving 750 species of exotic species, all with different natural diets, I learned how to achieve natural diets for even our land-dwelling domesticated pets of the mammal persuasion. Pet GI systems can transition back to their natural "wild" state if we provide them the right tools. Environment and exposures play a role but lack of correct building blocks in the biggest barrier to both medical and mental health. Our testimonial stories on Google and our website are very detailed and amazing. Check out OSCAR Therapy... It's Not psychic... it's Science!

Please contact and book us through Petworks. Thank you very much!

Thank you Casey!!!   
I had an excellent, highly informative consultation with Casey about how to meet the nutritional needs of my cat, Nugget, recently diagnosed with hyperthyroidism.   
Casey’s broad background in biology and science, as well as many years as biologist on a veterinary team in Boston shine through as she painted a complete picture of what I need to do to help my sweet friend. There is a lot of work for me to do, but Casey is solid in her support and is an encyclopedia of resources to assist with Nugget’s issues. Highly highly qualified as a guide in animal nutrition, a wealth of knowledge is at her fingertips. I recommend her without any reservation . You will not be sorry you chose her.   
Ten stars if I could!!

Wow! I wish every client was such a good animal guardian ! keep me posted on how things evolve! feel free to share, bloodwork, etc. 

**\- Casey Sugarman**

Consult was for a homemade recipe for my senior dog   
Casey was a good communicator, and has lots of knowledge in the dietary area, so I was able to get some helpful insight into creating a diet that would benefit my dogs health. I will rebook again with her soon to get her feedback before any major changes.

##### Pet Pro's Response:

Kelly,   
I am so glad I could help… When you have a hunch of what is right and wrong (it’s wrong that our vets don’t need any nutrition information to graduate that school) I am so happy to share all of the real tips and tricks. I learned about biology. Mainly that it’s all about “what what you eat has eaten itself“. Definitely get back in touch and also it’s good to experiment with “option feeding” and you can observe what the stomach/brain is craving. Bodies go through phases of healing.

**\- Casey Sugarman**

I can’t thank Dr. Sugarman enough for the incredible care and expertise she provided for my dog! Casey guided us through transitioning our golden retriever to a carnivore based diet. She took the time to explain every aspect of the diet, from the nutritional benefits of each food to how it will support my dog’s overall health.

Her knowledge and passion were evident in every topic we covered and she made me feel confident and informed about the changes we were making. I am confident with Dr. Sugarman’s guidance that my dog will be on the right path to living a healthier, more energetic life. 

If you have ever questioned what is in the food that you are feeding your dog, you need to speak with Dr. Sugarman. I cannot thank her enough and I give her my highest recommendation! Paul M.

##### Pet Pro's Response:

For clarity, I am not a doctor myself, however, I was a senior biologist on an exotics veterinary team caring for 750 species. I did everything the doctors did including case management and surgery. I so love meeting animal guardians who work hard to get out ahead of future troubles. The right diet is the best way towards prevention of future disease and chronic problems. So good to meet you, Paul! 

**\- Casey Sugarman**

It was a great positive consult. I’m glad that I reached out to Casey. I will reach out again after implementing some more changes that she recommended. It’s so helpful to have a reasonable person, approachable, demeanor, and affordable price. Things stacked up with vet, bills and food and medication’s, especially if your pup is not well. So Casey will be my go to going forward and I’m happy to recommend her to anybody else looking for a direct approach to healing your pets health.
