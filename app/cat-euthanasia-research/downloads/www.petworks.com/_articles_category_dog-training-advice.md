A Dog Trainer

Dog training advice. When hiring a [dog trainer](https://www.petworks.com/hire/dog-trainer), it’s important to consider several key factors to ensure a successful experience for both you and your dog. First, look for a trainer with proper credentials and experience, ideally certified by a recognized organization like the Association of Professional Dog Trainers (APDT) or the International Association of Canine Professionals (IACP). Their training philosophy is also important. Positive reinforcement techniques are widely recommended as they encourage good behavior through rewards rather than punishment.

Consider the trainer’s experience with your dog’s specific breed or behavioral issues. Communication is vital, so choose someone who is patient, listens to your concerns, and explains training techniques clearly. It’s also helpful to observe a session or ask for references to gauge the trainer’s effectiveness and approach. Remember that training is a partnership; the trainer should involve you in the process, teaching you how to reinforce good behavior at home. Ensure that the dog training environment is safe and conducive to learning, whether it’s in a group setting or private sessions. By thoroughly evaluating these aspects, you can hire a dog trainer who will help your pet develop good habits, improve behavior, and strengthen your bond.

# Is This Just a Puppy Phase or a Real Problem?

If you’ve ever brushed off your puppy’s behavior with _“They’ll grow out of it,”_ you’re not alone. Jumping, biting, barking, pulling on the leash, chewing furniture. Many pet parents assume these behaviors are just part of puppyhood. Sometimes, they are. But sometimes, waiting is the most expensive decision you can make.

Knowing the difference between a **normal puppy phase** and a **developing behavior problem** can save you stress, money, and heartbreak later.

### **What Counts as a Normal Puppy Phase?**

Puppies experience predictable developmental stages, especially in their first 18 months. During these phases, certain behaviors are expected.

**Common puppy-phase behaviors include:**

  * Mouthiness and nipping during teething

  * Short attention spans

  * Occasional accidents during house training

  * Temporary fear periods

  * Bursts of high energy followed by deep sleep




These behaviors usually **improve with consistent guidance, structure, and age**.

> “Puppies explore the world with their mouths and emotions. What matters isn’t that these behaviors exist. It’s whether they’re improving over time.” – [**Dr. Ian Dunbar** , Veterinarian & Animal Behaviorist](https://www.siriuspup.com/about/staff/dr-ian-dunbar-phd-bvetmed-mrcvs)

* * *

### **When “They’ll Grow Out of It” Becomes a Problem**

The red flag isn’t the behavior itself — it’s **the pattern**.

If a behavior is **intensifying, spreading, or causing safety concerns** , it’s no longer just a phase.

### Signs It’s More Than a Puppy Phase

  * Biting that breaks skin or escalates with age

  * Jumping that knocks people over

  * Fear responses that turn into avoidance or aggression

  * Barking that worsens instead of settling

  * Destructive behavior linked to anxiety

  * Leash reactivity toward people or dogs

  * Inability to calm down even after exercise




> “Time alone doesn’t fix behavior. Skills fix behavior. And the longer a habit is practiced, the harder it is to undo.” – [**Pat Miller** , Certified Professional Dog Trainer & Author](https://peaceablepaws.com/about/)

* * *

### **Why Waiting Often Makes Behavior Problems Worse**

Behavior is learned through repetition. When puppies rehearse unwanted behaviors — even unintentionally — those behaviors become **default coping mechanisms**.

What starts as:

  * playful nipping

  * mild fear

  * excitement barking




can evolve into:

  * adult biting

  * reactivity

  * chronic anxiety




And adult dogs don’t get the same social grace as puppies.

> “People tolerate behaviors in puppies that would be unacceptable in adult dogs. By the time they seek help, the dog has had months or years of practice.” – [**Karen Pryor** , Behavioral Scientist & Trainer](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/vets/biopryor.html)

* * *

### **The Hidden Cost of “Waiting It Out”**

Many pet parents delay training to save money — but early intervention is almost always cheaper.

**Delaying help can lead to:**

  * More intensive (and expensive) training later

  * Limited housing or travel options

  * Injuries to people or other pets

  * Emotional burnout for pet parents

  * Rehoming or surrender in severe cases




Early guidance often means **fewer sessions, faster results, and less stress**.

### **Puppy Phase vs. Real Problem: A Quick Comparison**

**Likely a Puppy Phase if:**

  * Behavior improves week to week

  * Puppy responds to redirection

  * Intensity decreases with structure

  * No fear or aggression involved




**Likely a Real Problem if:**

  * Behavior escalates with age

  * Puppy ignores or resists guidance

  * Fear, anxiety, or aggression appears

  * Daily life revolves around managing behavior




* * *

### **When to Seek Professional Help**

You don’t need to wait for a crisis to get support.

Consider working with a [puppy trainer](https://www.petworks.com/hire/puppy-trainer) or [canine behavior professional](https://www.petworks.com/hire/dog-behaviorist) if:

  * You feel overwhelmed or frustrated

  * Progress has stalled

  * Safety is a concern

  * Advice online feels contradictory

  * You’re saying “maybe next month” — repeatedly




> “The best time to get help is when you first ask yourself whether you need it.” – [**Victoria Stilwell** , Dog Trainer & Behavior Expert](https://positively.com/)

* * *

### **It’s Not a Failure — It’s Responsible Parenting**

Needing help doesn’t mean you failed your puppy. It means you’re paying attention.

Most serious behavior problems don’t start as emergencies — they start as **small concerns that were easy to ignore**.

“Most serious behavior problems don’t start as emergencies. They start as small issues pet parents were told to wait out. Time doesn’t change behavior. Guidance does.” – **Kevin Kinyon, Co-Founder, PetWorks**

### **Frequently Asked Questions**

### Will my puppy grow out of biting?

Some mouthiness improves naturally, but biting that escalates, causes injury, or continues past teething often needs professional guidance.

### At what age do dogs calm down?

Many dogs mature emotionally between 18–36 months, but without training, unwanted behaviors often remain — just in a larger body.

### Can separation anxiety go away on its own?

True separation anxiety rarely resolves without intervention and often worsens if untreated.

### Is it ever too early to [hire a dog trainer](https://www.petworks.com/hire/dog-trainer)?

No. Early guidance is usually faster, cheaper, and more effective than fixing ingrained behaviors later.

### Am I overreacting by getting help?

Most pet parents who seek help early wish they’d done it sooner — not later.

If you’re asking _“Is this just a phase?”_ that question alone is worth listening to.

Puppies grow.  
Habits grow faster.

# Lessons In How To Properly Train Your Dog

_by Kara Hollars, o wner of Personal Family Dog Trainer._

**  
****The Issue.** You see a person working with their dog, using treats as a reward. The person shows the dog a treat, then asks them for a behavior. The dog complies 100% of the time, which looks very impressive! This goes on for some time. Suddenly, a look of panic crosses the persons face. They’ve run out of treats! They ask their dog for another behavior, the dog looks for the treat, then gets up and walks away. The owner follows, desperately trying to get the dog to listen. What went wrong?
