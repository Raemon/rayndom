As a certified professional with extensive training in various aspects of pet health, I offer a range of specialized services including nutritional therapy, weight management support, and cancer-supportive nutrition. My expertise encompasses a variety of common health issues faced by senior dogs, such as chronic ear infections, gastrointestinal concerns, and joint mobility challenges. Additionally, I provide integrative wellness approaches, including medicinal mushroom protocols and CBD guidance, designed to support your pet's unique needs. My goal is to create clear, easy-to-follow protocols that reduce stress for you while maximizing your dog’s comfort and vitality.

I believe in fostering a strong human-animal bond, especially during difficult times, which is why I also offer emotional support and anticipatory grief counseling for families facing tough diagnoses.
