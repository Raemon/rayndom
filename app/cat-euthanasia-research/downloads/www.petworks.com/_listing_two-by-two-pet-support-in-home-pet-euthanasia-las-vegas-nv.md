Member since Jul 2025 

Welcome to Two By Two Pet Support — Las Vegas Nevada’s Premier White Glove Pet After-Life and Transport Service

At Two By Two Pet Support, we do more than care for pets — we care for families. As Nevada’s most trusted and compassionate provider of in-home euthanasia, after-life arrangements, and pet transport, we offer an unmatched level of care during life’s most delicate moments.

We specialize in dignified goodbyes from the comfort of home, cremation services tailored with love, and seamless, respectful transport for both living and deceased pets. And unlike any other service in Las Vegas, we hand-deliver your beloved pet’s ashes right back to your doorstep — because we believe every farewell should end with the comfort of home.

With over 20 years of veterinary and animal care experience, our team delivers true white glove service — marked by professionalism, transparency, and genuine compassion. Every detail is handled with the kind of respect and tenderness we’d want for our own pets.

Our Services Include:

In-Home Euthanasia by licensed veterinarians   
Private & Communal Cremation   
Doorstep Ashes Return (exclusive to us!)   
Pet Transport & Airport Pickups   
Emergency Medical Transport (small & medium pets)   
We are here for the families who want the absolute best for their pets — and nothing less.

If you want the best, contact and book us on Petworks. If you want anything less, call someone else.
