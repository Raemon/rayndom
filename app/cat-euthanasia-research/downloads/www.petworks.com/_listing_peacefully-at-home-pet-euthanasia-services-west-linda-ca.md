# Peacefully at Home Pet Euthanasia Services - West Linda, CA

Member since Apr 2022 

Pet euthanasia is a hard enough decision. I provide a stress free alternative to taking your pet to a clinic by performing this service at home. My name is Dr. Megan Dunbar, but most people know me as Dr. Megan or simply Megan. I have lived in the Sacramento Valley for over 35 years and have practiced Veterinary Medicine in Yuba County since 2014. During my time as a veterinarian, I have found that people wish they could end their beloved pet’s life in the comfort of their home. I have devoted my life to the care and comfort of animals and thought that if it was one of my pets, I would want them to transition in the comfort of their home. I provide pet owners the choice to say goodbye in the gentlest and most caring way possible.

I have been a veterinarian since 2014 and have been providing in home pet euthanasia since 2017. 

Please contact and book me on Petworks. Thank you.
