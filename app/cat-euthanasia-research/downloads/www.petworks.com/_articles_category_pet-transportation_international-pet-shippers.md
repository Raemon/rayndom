International Pet Shippers

Ensure safe and affordable international travel for all your family members, including pets, with a trusted international pet shipping service. USDA-registered and IPATA-accredited shippers uphold the highest standards in pet travel. USDA registration ensures compliance with U.S. animal welfare laws, while IPATA membership reflects adherence to global best practices in pet transport. These credentials guarantee a reliable, safe, and compassionate approach to international pet relocation. With numerous reputable companies available, relocating your pet to or from the United States is easier than ever.

When hiring an international pet shipper, pet parents should prioritize the safety and comfort of their pets. Research the company’s reputation, ensuring they have experience with international regulations and animal handling. Verify that they provide proper documentation, veterinary care, and a secure, climate-controlled environment during transit. Clear communication, transparency about costs, and contingency plans for delays or emergencies are essential. Choosing a company with positive reviews and accredited by relevant authorities ensures a stress-free experience for both pets and their parents.

[International pet shipping](https://www.petworks.com/hire/international-pet-shipping) is indeed expensive due to a variety of specialized services and regulations designed to ensure the safe and smooth transport of animals. Here are the key reasons why pet shipping costs are so high:

### **Handling and Care**

Shipping live animals requires professional care, training, and equipment. Pet shipping companies must have trained staff, proper facilities, and specific handling processes to keep pets safe and comfortable throughout the journey. This need for specialized care and resources raises the overall cost.

### **Documentation and Paperwork**

Shipping pets internationally requires preparing health certificates, permits, and customs paperwork. These legal documents must be prepared accurately to meet the requirements of both the sending and receiving countries. This administrative process can be complex, time-consuming, and expensive, often requiring professional assistance to avoid mistakes.

### **Transportation Logistics**

Booking flights and coordinating ground transport for pets can be complex. Ensuring that pets are transported safely, with the proper schedules, while adhering to airline regulations and customs procedures requires extensive planning. Ground transportation between airports, quarantine facilities, and homes adds further logistical costs.

### **Veterinary Services and Vaccinations**

Pets traveling internationally often need vaccinations, medical examinations, blood tests, and treatments to meet the health standards of the destination country. The cost of these veterinary services, which must be done prior to travel, contributes significantly to the overall expense.

### **Safety Measures and Regulations**

Pet shipping companies must comply with strict safety regulations regarding containers, crates, ventilation, and temperature control. These regulations are in place to ensure the well-being of pets during long flights or transport periods, and meeting these requirements often requires investing in high-quality, approved carriers, further increasing costs.

### **Insurance Coverage**

Many pet shipping companies offer insurance to cover potential risks during the transportation process, including delays, health issues, or loss. This insurance helps mitigate risks but adds to the total cost.

The overall expense of international pet shipping reflects the specialized nature of the service and the multiple factors involved in ensuring pets are transported safely and legally.

# What Is The Safest Way To Travel Internationally With A Pet?

Let’s discuss airpets international. Flying with your pets internationally is a significant undertaking that requires thorough preparation, understanding of regulations, and a commitment to ensuring your pet’s safety and comfort. For pet parents planning an international trip, it’s essential to be informed about the steps involved, potential challenges, and resources available to streamline the process. This guide covers everything you need to know before traveling abroad with dogs and cats, highlighting the invaluable assistance provided by Petworks’ [USDA](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/pet-travel)-registered [international pet shippers](https://www.petworks.com/hire/international-pet-shipping).

### Understanding International Pet Travel Regulations

The first step in planning international travel with your pet is understanding the destination country’s pet import regulations. These rules vary widely by country and may include:

  * **Vaccination Requirements:** Most countries require pets to be vaccinated against rabies, often within a specific timeframe before travel. Some nations may also require additional vaccines.
  * **Health Certificates:** A health certificate issued by a licensed veterinarian is typically required. This document confirms your pet is healthy and fit for travel.
  * **Microchipping:** Many countries mandate that pets be microchipped with an ISO-compliant chip for identification purposes.
  * **Quarantine Rules:** Some destinations enforce quarantine periods ranging from a few days to several weeks. It’s important to research this beforehand.



Failing to meet these requirements can lead to delays, fines, or even refusal of entry for your pet. Working with an expert who understands these regulations, such as Petworks’ international pet shippers, can alleviate the stress and ensure compliance.

### Choosing the Right Travel Carrier

Selecting an appropriate travel carrier is critical for your pet’s safety and comfort during the journey. The carrier should meet airline and International Air Transport Association (IATA) standards, which typically include:

  * **Adequate Size:** Your pet should be able to stand, turn around, and lie down comfortably in the carrier.
  * **Ventilation:** Ensure the carrier has sufficient ventilation for airflow.
  * **Secure Fastenings:** The carrier must be securely fastened to prevent accidental openings.
  * **Absorbent Materials:** Place absorbent bedding inside to keep your pet dry during the trip.



If your pet is not accustomed to being in a carrier, start the acclimation process weeks before the journey to reduce anxiety.

### Preparing for the Flight

Before the travel date, there are several steps you can take to ensure your pet is ready for the flight:

  * **Visit the Veterinarian:** Schedule a vet check-up to confirm your pet’s health status and obtain necessary vaccinations and certificates.
  * **Hydration and Feeding:** Avoid feeding your pet a heavy meal right before the flight to prevent discomfort. Ensure they are well-hydrated but not overly full.
  * **Exercise:** Allow your pet to exercise before heading to the airport to help them relax.
  * **Comfort Items:** Place familiar items, such as a favorite blanket or toy, in the carrier to provide a sense of security.



### Booking Flights for Pets

Not all airlines have the same policies for pet travel, so it’s essential to research and choose an airline that prioritizes pet safety. Some airlines allow small pets to travel in the cabin, while others require pets to be transported in the cargo hold.

Key considerations when booking flights include:

  * **Non-Stop Flights:** Opt for direct flights to minimize stress and reduce the risk of mishandling during transfers.
  * **Climate Control:** Ensure the airline offers climate-controlled cargo holds for pets traveling as cargo.
  * **Advance Booking:** Reserve your pet’s spot well in advance, as airlines often have limited space for pet travelers.

# How Safe And Comfortable Is A Flight For My Dog?

A Comprehensive Guide to Transporting Dogs via Airplane. Air travel with dogs can be a daunting task, but with the right planning and resources, it becomes a manageable and safe process. Whether you’re relocating, going on vacation, or sending your dog to a new home, understanding the options available…including flight nannies, pet transport services, and compliance with regulations for both domestic and international travel…is important to ensuring a smooth journey for your furry companion.

#### Domestic Air Travel for Dogs

Domestic air travel is generally more straightforward than international travel, but it still requires careful planning. Airlines in the United States have specific rules for transporting pets, depending on the dog’s size and breed.

  * **Cabin Travel:** Small dogs, typically weighing under 20 pounds, can often travel in the cabin with their owners. They must be placed in an airline-approved carrier that fits under the seat in front of you.
  * **Cargo Travel:** Larger dogs must travel in the cargo hold in a secured, ventilated crate that meets International Air Transport Association (IATA) standards. While cargo holds are temperature-controlled, certain breeds—like brachycephalic dogs…may not be allowed due to health risks.



Before booking, check your airline’s pet policy and ensure your dog meets all requirements. Additionally, book your pet’s travel well in advance, as airlines often have limited space for pets on flights.

#### International Air Travel for Dogs

International travel adds layers of complexity due to varying regulations across countries.

  * **Health Certificates:** Most countries require a [health certificate](https://www.petworks.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Health-Certificate-For-Pet-Travel.pdf) issued by a USDA-accredited veterinarian. This document verifies your dog is healthy and vaccinated, particularly against rabies.
  * **Microchipping:** Many countries mandate that dogs be microchipped with an [ISO-compliant microchip](https://www.pettravel.com/information/articles/why-your-pet-needs-a-microchip/).
  * **Quarantine Requirements:** Some destinations, such as Australia and New Zealand, have strict quarantine rules. Research the destination’s requirements well in advance to avoid surprises.
  * **Pet Passports:** In regions like the European Union, pet passports simplify travel by consolidating health and vaccination records into one document.



Planning for [international pet travel](https://www.petworks.com/hire/international-pet-shipping) often involves consulting with a pet transport service or an animal relocation expert to navigate the regulations and paperwork.

Let’s Hear From Vet Experts:

“Flying with your dog can be safe if you take the right precautions. It’s essential to consult your veterinarian before travel to ensure your pet is healthy enough for the journey. Acclimating your dog to their carrier, choosing direct flights, and avoiding sedation unless prescribed are key steps to minimize stress and risks.” – [Dr. Jennifer Coates, DVM](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifercoatesdvm/)

“While air travel can be stressful for dogs, it’s not inherently dangerous. The cargo hold is pressurized and climate-controlled, but it’s still preferable to have your pet travel in the cabin with you. If cargo is necessary, ensure the carrier is IATA-compliant and acclimate your dog to it well in advance.” – [Dr. Sarah Wooten, DVM](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-wooten-dvm-cvj-3068a929/)

#### Role of Flight Nannies

[Flight nannies](https://www.petworks.com/hire/flight-nanny) are professionals who accompany pets on flights, ensuring their safety and comfort throughout the journey. This service is particularly beneficial for puppies or dogs that might experience stress during travel.

  * **In-Cabin Transport:** Flight nannies typically fly in the cabin with the dog, ensuring close supervision.
  * **Custom Itineraries:** They manage logistics, including layovers, ensuring the dog is cared for at all times.
  * **Specialized Care:** Flight nannies are trained to handle unexpected situations, such as delays or health emergencies.



To hire a flight nanny, look for reputable companies or freelance nannies with positive reviews. Ensure they are familiar with airline policies and the specific needs of your dog.

#### **Pet Transport Services**

Professional [pet transport services](https://www.petworks.com/hire/pet-transport) handle the logistics of shipping pets, including booking flights, obtaining necessary documentation, and ensuring compliance with airline and country-specific regulations. Many services offer door-to-door options, where they pick up your pet from your home and deliver them to the destination.

### **USDA Pet Travel**

The United States Department of Agriculture ([USDA](https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/blog/navigating-pet-travel-let-aphis-help)) plays a crucial role in regulating pet travel, particularly for international and interstate transportation. Its primary focus is to ensure the safety, health, and welfare of pets, while preventing the spread of diseases across borders. For international pet travel, the USDA oversees the certification of health documents, ensuring pets meet the import requirements of destination countries. Accredited veterinarians prepare health certificates, which must then be endorsed by the USDA for compliance. The USDA also sets standards for airline-approved pet carriers, ensuring the safety and comfort of animals during transit. For interstate travel, especially involving livestock or exotic pets, USDA regulations safeguard animal health by requiring specific documentation and quarantine measures. By collaborating with airlines, veterinarians, and pet owners, the USDA facilitates smooth travel while prioritizing biosecurity, public health, and animal welfare. Its regulations help pet parents navigate complex logistics confidently and responsibly.

### Special Considerations for Air Travel

#### **Breed Restrictions**

Some airlines and countries impose restrictions on specific breeds. For example, brachycephalic breeds may not be allowed in the cargo hold due to their higher risk of respiratory distress. Always confirm breed policies before booking.

#### **Age Requirements**

Most airlines require dogs to be at least 8-10 weeks old to travel. Puppies may need additional vaccinations depending on the destination.

#### **Weather Restrictions**

Extreme temperatures can affect pet travel, particularly in the cargo hold. Airlines often have seasonal restrictions to protect pets during hot summers and cold winters.

**Tips for a Smooth Journey:**

  * **Visit the Vet:** Schedule a pre-travel checkup to ensure your dog is healthy enough to fly.
  * **Update Microchip Information:** Ensure your dog’s microchip is registered with current contact details.
  * **Pack a Travel Kit:** Include food, water, waste bags, and a comfort item like a blanket or toy.
  * **Exercise Before the Flight:** A tired dog is less likely to experience anxiety during travel.



### **So…How Comfortable and Safe Is A Flight For My Dog?**

Many pet owners worry about the safety and comfort of their dog during air travel, and these concerns are valid. A dog’s experience in the air depends on multiple factors, including their size, breed, temperament, and whether they travel in the cabin or cargo. Small dogs traveling in the cabin often experience less stress, as they remain close to their owners in a familiar environment. Airlines require that in-cabin pets stay in approved carriers that fit under the seat, providing a cozy, secure space for the dog throughout the flight.

For larger dogs that must travel in the cargo hold, safety and comfort are more complex issues. Airlines maintain climate-controlled, pressurized cargo areas and follow strict protocols to handle pets carefully. Still, pets can experience anxiety due to unfamiliar noises, vibrations, and separation from their owner. Choosing direct flights whenever possible reduces travel time and limits handling stress.

Preparation is key to keeping your dog comfortable. Gradually acclimate your dog to their travel crate at home and ensure they get plenty of exercise before the flight to make a big difference. Feeding should be light before travel to prevent nausea, and always provide access to water. Some airlines also offer specific kennel requirements to maximize comfort, such as padding and ventilation.

### **Breed Matters**

Certain breeds, particularly brachycephalic (short-nosed) dogs, are at higher risk of breathing difficulties and heat stress during flights. Pet owners should consult their veterinarian to assess travel readiness and discuss strategies to minimize risk. Veterinarians generally discourage sedating pets because it can interfere with their natural breathing and stress responses

Ultimately, while flying with a dog involves some risks, careful planning, the right carrier, and adherence to airline guidelines can make air travel a safe and comfortable experience for most dogs. Understanding your dog’s specific needs and preparing accordingly ensures a smoother journey for both pet and owner.

### **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Flying With Dogs**

**1\. Can my dog fly in the cabin with me?**  
Small dogs may fly in the cabin if they fit in an airline-approved carrier that goes under the seat. Larger dogs usually travel in the cargo hold. Always check the airline’s specific policies.

**2\. What documentation does my dog need to fly?**  
Domestic flights typically require a health certificate from your veterinarian. International flights often require additional paperwork, vaccinations, and sometimes microchipping.

**3\. How can I make my dog comfortable during the flight?**  
Gradually crate-train your dog, provide exercise before the flight, feed a light meal, ensure proper hydration, and choose direct flights when possible.

**4\. Are there breeds that should avoid flying?**  
Brachycephalic breeds (short-nosed dogs) like Bulldogs and Pugs are at higher risk for breathing problems, especially in cargo. Consult a vet before travel.

**5\. Should I sedate my dog for the flight?**  
Sedation is generally discouraged because it can interfere with breathing and stress responses. Always consult your veterinarian for advice.

**6\. How much does it cost to fly with a dog?**  
Costs vary depending on airline, travel distance, and whether your dog flies in the cabin or cargo. Cabin fees are usually lower, while cargo transport is more expensive.

**7\. What safety measures do airlines take for pets?**  
Airlines use climate-controlled, pressurized cargo areas and follow handling protocols to ensure safety. Direct flights and proper crate selection further reduce risk.

**8\. How early should I prepare for a dog flight?**  
Preparation should begin weeks in advance for crate training, vet checkups, and gathering required documentation. Early booking is also essential, as airlines limit the number of pets per flight.

**9\. Can my dog get stressed during a flight, and how can I help?**  
Yes, dogs can get stressed from noises, turbulence, and separation. Familiar blankets or toys in the carrier, short practice trips, and staying calm yourself can help reduce anxiety.

**10\. What should I do if my dog has special medical needs?**  
Consult your veterinarian well in advance. Some airlines allow medical oxygen, medications, or other accommodations, but these must be arranged ahead of time.

**11\. Is it better to fly during the day or night?**  
Daytime flights are often preferred for dogs because airlines have more staff available and it’s easier to monitor temperature-sensitive cargo. Early morning or late evening can also help avoid extreme temperatures.

### **Preparing for Post-Travel**

After your dog’s flight, give them time to adjust and recover. Provide water immediately upon arrival and monitor for signs of stress or dehydration. If traveling internationally, comply with any required quarantine periods.
