# The Soulful Pet - Animal Communicator - Nationwide

Verified Member since Jul 2017 

Hi!

I’m Ruth, a pet behavior consultant and animal intuitive with over 25 years of experience dedicated to improving the lives of cats, dogs, and their human companions.

I’m a biologist and a pet behavior specialist affiliated with esteemed organizations like the Association of Professional Dog Trainers (APDT), the Pet Professionals Guild (PPG), and the International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants (IAABC). 

I offer virtual consultations & readings nationwide for a flat rate of $150 for up to one hour.

Blending science with intuition, I offer a holistic approach to pet behavior modification. As the author of "Intuitive Evolution," I strive to create a deeper understanding between pets and their guardians. 

Whether it’s through intuitive animal/human readings or training with positive reinforcement techniques, my goal is to foster a loving and respectful bond between you and your pets. 

I’m unlike most animal communicators in that I also have extensive, science -based expertise in dog & cat behavior and health. 

During a reading, I will always let you know if the info I give you is intuitive or scientific. That synergy of science & soul provides the best possible results for you & your pet.

Are you ready to enhance your pet's well-being and strengthen your bond? Let’s meet virtually! 

If you’re nearby, you’re welcome to visit my intuitive advisor office in Santa Rosa for readings and intuitive guidance sessions.

Book me through Petworks today. I look forward to meeting you!
