# Karey Boise, CPN - Pet Nutrition Consulting - Nationwide

(5 reviews)

Verified Member since Apr 2025 

Hi, I’m Karey Boise, a Certified Clinical Pet Nutritionist (CPN), Pet Therapeutic Nutrition Coach (PTNC) and founder of Your Pet's Nutritionist. I specialize in helping pet parents create personalized nutrition plans tailored to their dog or cat’s unique needs. I believe that the foundation of true wellness starts with fresh, whole foods—and that every pet deserves a diet as individual as they are. My goal is to guide you in making informed, holistic choices that support your pet’s long-term health and happiness.

I have completed 500 hours of training through the Academy of Natural Health Sciences Training Center in Clinical Pet Nutrition. I am prepared to help your cat or dog, no matter what issue they may be having. I can help with some of the most common issues pet parents face, starting with food allergies or sensitivities, which often show up as itching, ear infections, or digestive problems. I can also address chronic diarrhea and gastrointestinal upset, using diet adjustments and gut-supporting ingredients. Skin and coat problems, like dryness or excessive shedding, are another key area where nutrition plays a big role. 

Helping pets maintain a healthy weight—whether dealing with obesity or underweight—is essential for long-term health. And for pet parents making homemade meals, I can ensure the diet is balanced and complete, preventing deficiencies and promoting overall wellness.

I look forward to working together to provide your pet with the longest, happiest, healthiest life possible! Please contact and book me on Petworks. Thank you.

## Customer Reviews

Karey is thorough, informative, prompt and responsive. She researched products that could help my pup, including places to find it in my area. My dog loves his new diet and I felt in great hands with Karey’s guidance. Will be working with her again for more recipes soon!

Stacey is an amazing dog mom! She goes above and beyond for Lyla. Thank you for trusting me with your pet's care. I can't wait to see Lyla's health improve with the modifications we made to her diet. You're awesome!

**\- Karey Boise**

Karey was delightful to work with, thorough about my dogs issues, and provide wealth of knowledge for food, snacks, and natural options.

**\- Stacey R**

I recently began using a homemade recipe for our 5 yr old lab. My vet was supportive, but recommended I consult with a certified nutritionist to ensure our dog was getting all she needs to remain healthy. I found Karey on Petworks. She was reasonably priced, responsive, and thorough in her explanations. She reviewed my recipe and made adjustments to solve for deficiencies. I now have a balanced holistic recipe. Super pleased with Karey and all she provided. She answered all my questions and offered suggestions. Highly recommend! Will be using her again for a recipe variation in the future.

Michaelle is a very caring dog mom that just wants the best for her pup! It was great working with her and I can't wait to see Polly's transformation on the new diet and work with her again in the future.
