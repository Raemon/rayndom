# Pet Nutrition Alliance: Empowering Pet Health Through Science

The Pet Nutrition Alliance (PNA) is a nonprofit coalition dedicated to enhancing pet health by promoting evidence-based nutritional practices for dogs and cats. Backed by a group of respected veterinary organizations, the PNA equips veterinary professionals with the tools and resources they need to guide pet owners toward better, healthier dietary choices. In a world filled with overwhelming pet food options and marketing claims, the PNA brings clarity, credibility, and confidence to the conversation around pet nutrition.

## 🌟 What Does the PNA Do?

### 1\. **Educational Tools for Veterinary Professionals**

  * Offers tools such as **calorie calculators** (available in English, Spanish, and French), **body and muscle condition scoring charts** , feeding guides, and printable client handouts aimed at improving nutrition consultations [AVMA+1vmae.org+1](https://www.avma.org/javma-news/2014-03-15/website-provides-tools-pet-nutrition?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

  * Provides webinars, workshops (e.g. Nutrifluent), and step-by-step guidelines on performing nutritional assessments for dogs and cats [AVMA](https://www.avma.org/javma-news/2012-05-15/pet-nutrition-alliance-advocates-nutritional-assessments?utm_source=chatgpt.com).




### 2\. **Nutritional Assessment Advocacy**

  * Encourages the standard practice of conducting a nutritional evaluation at every veterinary visit, supported by AAHA nutritional assessment guidelines [Rock Bridge Animal Hospital+14AVMA+14AVMA+14](https://www.avma.org/javma-news/2012-05-15/pet-nutrition-alliance-advocates-nutritional-assessments?utm_source=chatgpt.com).




### 3\. **“Dare to Ask!” Manufacturer Evaluation Tool**

  * PNA surveyed over 200 pet food manufacturers in the U.S. and Canada using WSAVA-based criteria (e.g. presence of qualified nutritionists, manufacturing controls, nutrient transparency).

  * The **“Dare to Ask!”** report compiles this objective data to support veterinary teams in making informed recommendations beyond just reading ingredient labels [petnutritionalliance.org+7vmae.org+7petnutritionalliance.org+7](https://vmae.org/2019/05/24/pet-nutrition-alliance-announces-dare-to-ask-a-new-resource-to-aid-in-making-informed-decisions-about-pet-foods/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).




### 4\. **Pet Food Manufacturer Evaluation Report**

  * Publicly available and regularly updated, this report compares manufacturers based on key parameters such as quality control, nutritional expertise, and manufacturing ownership [petnutritionalliance.org+1vmae.org+1](https://petnutritionalliance.org/resources/pet-food-manufacturer-evaluation-report/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).




* * *

## 👥 Why It Matters

  * It addresses the overwhelming number of pet food options by giving veterinarians reliable, non-commercial guidance when advising pet owners [petnutritionalliance.org+15AVMA+15vmae.org+15](https://www.avma.org/javma-news/2014-03-15/website-provides-tools-pet-nutrition?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

  * Instead of focusing on marketing claims or ingredient lists, PNA emphasizes measurable factors: **nutritional adequacy statement** , **feeding trials** , **quality of manufacturing** , and **manufacturer transparency** [Wikipedia+11petnutritionalliance.org+11AVMA+11](https://petnutritionalliance.org/resources/pet-food-manufacturer-evaluation-report/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).




* * *

## 🧭 How Veterinary Teams & Pet Owners Benefit

  * Vets get structured tools and standardized checklists to assess and tailor pet nutrition strategies.

  * Pet owners receive vetted, objective information via their veterinary clinics—helping translate scientific nutrition guidelines into everyday care.

  * The **“Dare to Ask!”** tool simplifies what would otherwise be a lengthy manufacturer-by-manufacturer inquiry process for veterinary teams [Rock Bridge Animal Hospital+5AVMA+5AVMA+5](https://www.avma.org/javma-news/2012-05-15/pet-nutrition-alliance-advocates-nutritional-assessments?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[vmae.org+1Reddit+1](https://vmae.org/2019/05/24/pet-nutrition-alliance-announces-dare-to-ask-a-new-resource-to-aid-in-making-informed-decisions-about-pet-foods/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
