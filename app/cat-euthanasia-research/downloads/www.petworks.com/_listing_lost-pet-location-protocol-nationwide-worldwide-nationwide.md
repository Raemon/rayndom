Lost Pet Location Protocol™ — Nationwide & Worldwide

If your pet is missing and you need guidance beyond flyers, shelters, and social media, this service provides focused intuitive support to help direct your physical search.

I offer a structured Lost Pet Location Protocol™ using animal communication, Reiki, and map correlation to provide actionable insight during emotionally overwhelming situations. With 30+ client reviews, this protocol has supported lost-pet searches across the U.S. and internationally.   
How the Process Works (Please Read Carefully)

This service follows a specific order to preserve transparency and ethical integrity.

After purchase:

~You receive my cell phone number for text communication and send clear photos of your pet looking into the camera (for energetic connection only).

~I connect with your pet through animal communication and Reiki and take detailed written intuitive notes, including drawings.

~You receive the written intuitive notes and drawings first.   
No location information is requested or used at this stage.

~Only after the notes are delivered do I request the address where your pet went missing.

~I use Google Maps to correlate the already-completed notes with physical locations and surroundings.

~You receive a Location Report via text, including:

-Map screenshots with possible locations

-Environmental and directional details

-An explanation of how the notes and drawings relate to the maps

-Guidance to help prioritize physical search efforts

This order is intentional and protects the integrity of the work.

What This Service Supports

~Understanding movement patterns

~Gaining insight into surroundings and conditions

~Clarifying your pet’s emotional or physical state

~Helping focus and prioritize search efforts

This is a structured protocol, not general psychic impressions.

Core Report   
Price: $280

Includes:

~Cell phone number provided upon purchase

~Written intuitive notes with drawings delivered before the missing-location address is requested

~Map correlation after the address is provided

~One complete explanation included with the final Location Report

~Map screenshots, terrain impressions, movement insights

~Emotional or behavioral state of your pet

~Remote Reiki support

Extended Support   
Price: $440

Includes everything in the Core Report, plus:

~48 hours of post-report text support

~Additional interpretation of the existing notes, drawings, and maps

~Clarification and emotional support as questions arise

~Continued text access to my cell phone number

Important: Extended Support does not include live or real-time psychic tracking, new readings, or ongoing monitoring. All support is based only on the completed report.

Important Notes

This service does not replace physical searching

No guarantees are made

Results vary by case

No refunds or discounts are offered. If your pet is located after payment but before I begin work on your case, the full payment will be applied as a credit toward any other service I offer on Petworks of equal value.

Transparency Statement

The missing-location address is requested only after intuitive notes (including drawings) are completed and delivered. This is intentional and protects the integrity of the process.

Respectful Communication Policy

This service is provided in emotionally sensitive circumstances. Abusive, threatening, or accusatory communication may result in termination of text support. Respectful communication is required.

Lost Pet Location Protocol™ Core Report

$ 280.00 Per Animal [book](/lost-pet-location-protocol-nationwide-worldwide-nationwide/book?id=6346)

Message me first to see if we are a good fit to work together.   
This is perfect for you if you are wanting information regarding a lost pet. Upon purchase, I require a photo of your pet and then I type out a report of the impressions I receive through mediumship and reiki animal communication. Delivery of your report within 24-48 hours, first come first serve. Please do not provide ANY information besides the photo of your pet. Doing so may jeopardize the clearness of the information I am given through psychic means. If I need more information, I will ask you directly. Doing so allows me to receive clear communication from your pet & my spirit team to then translate the information to you. All services with me are held in the highest spiritual integrity with all that is. Always for the good and healing of all beings involved. Rooted in truth and authenticity.   
After receiving your pet's photos ( looking into the camera if possible) I connect and communicate with your baby while taking notes and requesting specific information about location, well-being, and what happened. I also relay that you are searching for them and that you love them so much. After this step, I send you my notes to keep everything in spiritual integrity. I then request the address they went missing from to start piecing things together. I provide screenshots of Google Maps of possible locations and actionable suggestions that may have not been thought of previously.   
Please feel free to message me with any questions or concerns.

## Customer Reviews

HUGE help!! She put us right on the location where our dog was hiding out. I can’t even explain how she can do this. She’s VERY helpful. Super nice person and so helpful. Her communication is stellar as well. Highly recommended! 

**\- Todd N**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

Todd was the best person to work with thus far! Down to Earth, patient, and most of all active! By following my suggestions, Todd was reunited with Beefcake almost immediately! Beefcake is alive and well. I enjoyed working with Todd.

**\- Lindsey Latham**

Lindsey was very kind and helpful in the search to find my lost cat. She was able to confirm that she was still alive but very lost. We were able to figure out her location and to tell her how to get home. So far she has not gotten home but I have hope that she will make it soon! 

**\- Mystic S**

I you love your pets and one goes missing contact Lindsey!!! I don't know how she does it but she is amazing. She helped direct me to where he was hiding but then she helped him find his way home! I can't thank her enough!!

**\- Andrew S**

From the very beginning, she was incredibly responsive, kind, and genuinely caring. Every message felt personal and reassuring, and her directions and updates were spot on (notes and mapping of areas where my cat could possibly be located). It was clear she truly loves what she does and cares deeply. Thanks to her help, I found Maurice and I’m beyond grateful for her support and guidance. 

**\- Raluca H**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

Thank you for allowing me to help find Maurice. I enjoyed meeting both of you. 

**\- Lindsey Latham**

Our collaboration with Lindsey was a success. She requested a picture of our cat looking into the camera. Using that information exclusively, Lindsey identified the conditions under which our cat was located which included a stone wall, fallen branches, and a view of a white house with a window at its apex. After that information was provided by Lindsey, we furnished our address which subsequently allowed her to determine our lost cat’s geographic location and provide a map. We were pleasantly surprised with Lindsey’s accuracy and conviction. Thank you Lindsey!

**\- Glenn S**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

Absolute extraordinary experience working with Glenn. By far top-tier.

**\- Lindsey Latham**

I want to sincerely thank Lindsey for her help and guidance during one of the most difficult times in our lives — when our beloved dog went missing. She picked up on several key details and emotions that truly resonated with our situation and gave us valuable direction and hope when we felt lost.

Her compassion, calm energy, and genuine care meant so much to us. She took the time to listen and connect, and I truly felt she wanted to help from the heart.

We are deeply grateful for her support and for the clarity she provided during such an emotional experience. Thank you, Lindsey, for sharing your gift and for helping guide us through a very painful and confusing time.

**\- Christian A**

Lindsey was very clear about her process and gave detailed explanations to all of her insights. She made herself available very often and did her best to help in our search. My Littlefoot is still missing but we’re grateful for the help that Lindsey provided. 

**\- Karissa T**

Lindsey worked relentlessly to find my dog Midas who was stolen from my home and lost for 7 days. Lindsey was the only reason I was able to finally sleep at night, she worked with me morning afternoon and night to find Midas and because of her , I found him . Even if she hadn’t been able to , the peace of mind she gifted me would have been worth it alone and I will definitely be continuing to do some other work with Lindsey. Thank you so much for everything!!! You are amazing!!!

**\- Brandon K**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

My heart is full from meeting you both. Thank you. 

**\- Lindsey Latham**

Everything went smoothly with Lindsay. Her connection with my pet was just incredible. I feel I now understand my pet fears and need. Thank you Lindsay. You were pawnominal!!!

**\- Maria H**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

Fantastic session. Absolutely loved meeting you both.

**\- Lindsey Latham**

Lindsey is great. Communicative, punctual, clear, and kind. She is very talented and intuitive. She indicated some very specific locations to help us find our cat. She provided additional context and background information that has helped us piece together what is going on. We haven’t gone out to look in the suggested area yet but Lindsey’s guidance has filled us with hope and positivity. I would recommend her services if you are struggling with a lost pet. 

**\- Laurel H**

Lindsey is very quick to respond to the initial inquiry, and very effective at communicating thereafter. She gives clear instructions. She put a lot of time and energy into my situation. 

**\- Jen H**

Well to early to tell but Lindsey has been responsive so far. It's just been exhausting and heartbreaking going through this so we are staying positive and trusting that Ms Lindsey will do her very best for us abd pur lil boy DOG

**\- Christie Y**

Lindsey was a big help in my search for Ella, my   
dog who went missing. I felt she really went the "extra mile".

**\- Dan V**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

Dan is awesome!

**\- Lindsey Latham**

Lindsey was so incredibly sweet and supportive! I will definitely be working with her again I cannot recommend her enough. You can tell she truly cares about the people she works with. 

**\- Sydney B**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

Very cool experience. She found Froggy the morning I did the report but was so excited she forgot to let me know. SO I got to do the report and then find out he was found. Froggy had said to let her know to turn the lights on at night to help him find home and here they had slept with all of the lights on that night due to being out so late looking for him. When they woke up, he was outside waiting for them. I love experiences like this that inadvertently provide proof from the Universe that we are ALL connected and I can honestly translate accurate information.

**\- Lindsey Latham**

Lindsey absolutely has a gift. She was so helpful and kind in reuniting us with our lost cat Jasper. I definitely recommend! 

**\- Savanna S**

Lindsey was so kind as my frantic contact came after midnight and I was up all night driving around searching for my dog and she was with me every step of the way & giving me descriptions of where a moving dog had been. 

The location of where the dog was hiding was an area unsafe to go at night and while I drove around the area for hours calling for her she, too, was frantic & wouldn't come out but she was found the next afternoon in an area that exits from the creek. Lindsey was spot on in telling me where she knew the dog to be.

She is a very kind person who really cares about the animals she's asked to help find.

**\- Kathryn G**

Lindsey went above and beyond to help me throughout my entire search for Noche. She was spot on with suggestions and landmarks to look for, Noche was exactly where she suggested. She had insight to things only Noche knew, and that helped me stay on the right track. She also was very encouraging, and honest about what to expect. I would not have found him without her help, and after 15 days it seemed impossible. She advised it would take time, and I needed to not give up easily. I would 100% recommend Lindsey over and over again. Thank you so much! 

**\- Yvonne S**

My dog was itching like crazy, and Lindsey come up with a change in the water. The itching did start when we moved to a new house, which had a well. Bottled water for my baby from now on.

**\- Belinda A**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

I was able to communicate clearly with Pokey and help Belinda with why he has been itching. 

**\- Lindsey Latham**

We weren’t sure what to expect when we reached out to Lindsey. Lindsey helped us find our lost cat. We were extremely sad and worried that our cat was missing for serval days. At that point we were willing to try anything to find our cat. We ended up stumbling across Lindsey. I provided some details about my cat and within 24 hours she reached out to us. She provided us with useful detailed information about my cats wellbeing and where she is. After following the information she provided us we were able to locate her that same night. We will definitely be using her services again in the future to check in with our baby girl. 

**\- Lira N**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

I was able to locate Nala, Brandon's Cat, and lead him right to her in real-time. They had her back home 2 days later. Working with Brandon to find Nala was the most rewarding experience I have had thus far in the psychic pet location & retrieval realm.

**\- Lindsey Latham**

Loved our session!! Lindsey is so kind and gave me great insight with our kitties. 

**\- Kristina K**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

Lovely communication session. 

**\- Lindsey Latham**

My first cat, Lady, is sassy and the love of my life. Lindsey was able to connect to her and communicate back to me in a way that fits Lady so much that it had me grinning. Lol. I plan on diving deeper into connecting with my cat through Lindsey because of how well it went this time. 

**\- Lisbet V**

Thanks to Lindsey, my family was able to find my dearest Lou. Unfortunately she had passed, but if gave me the closure I so strongly needed. She is at peace and I can give her a proper memorial. 

**\- Lillian G**

Thank you for putting my mind at ease!

**\- Jean T**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

Jean, You are welcome. I love to help. Cooper just brings a smile to my heart. Keep in touch.

**\- Lindsey Latham**

Lindsey was awesome!!!! She took extra steps by sending all notes and mapping of areas where the dog could possibly be located. She took extra time and answered all questions immediately. I highly recommend her!!

**\- Robin S**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

Aww, thank you so much. I enjoyed working with you and Looska.

**\- Lindsey Latham**

It went well.

**\- Teresa J**

I didn’t find my dog so I’m going to try it again I’m heartbroken 

**\- Debra G**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

In your situation, you had given your dog to someone else who abandoned him. In your situation, I did my best and provided you with PLENTY of avenues to locate the moving target.

**\- Lindsey Latham**

Lindsay was really helpful and intune with my pet who in in a doggie hospital, currently unwell. It was a very positive experience for me, and I’m am sure he has been excited from the reiki. 

**\- Julie I**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

I enjoyed meeting you both. ❤️

**\- Lindsey Latham**

I am less than pleased and not impressed with Lindsey at all. I understand animal communication because I do that as well. My experience with her was like a wild goose chase and she was throwing darts at a wall that did not even exist. My husband and have searched everywhere and have looked at every place we possible could and still have not found him. Her guidance started by saying he was in one type of place and when that didn't prove him being found, she shifted to something totally different and looking in a direction toward something over a mile away that he would have no clue of. From against a house to a wide open field. My cat is still missing and I feel like it was not a fair exchange of energy since she worked with me one day and "rested" the next and now is only lighting a candle and can't do any more. I have more to say but will keep it for now. Have a blessed day and I will continue to search for my cat.

**\- Pam C**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

I worked with you for 4 days! On the 3rd day YES I had to rest! I also delivered your report a day early and did everything I could to help you. 

**\- Lindsey Latham**

My cat has been missing for over 10 days. After consulting many animal communicators without success, I was excited to begin working with Lindsey because of her wonderful reviews. People mentioned that she was supportive, answered questions quickly and went above and beyond with them. That was the furthest from the truth in my experience. I don’t wish the emotional rollercoaster that I experienced with her on anyone! 

She did not follow through on when she would submit the report more than once. The first time I was told by the afternoon at the latest so I was glued to my phone all morning. Then at 3:30 pm she said she would have it by late at night. I had told her that I had taken the day off from work to look for her that day and was hoping to have it by sundown. This is when she said soon and then I didn’t hear from her for 8 hours. She ignored my messages for hours and turned in the report at 3am the next morning past the 24hour mark that she said she wouldn’t pass. 

The report was vague, gave me a street name and little other information. Most of my questions went unanswered and I never found out about the state of my pet. She had told me she would be there that day to answer some questions but she wasn’t. This was the biggest waste of my money and caused me a level of anxiety I have rarely experienced. 

The reading was unprofessional and I compassionate to the max! 

**\- Gabriela F**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

I do not recommend 

**\- Lindsey Latham**

Although Lindsey was very nice, there was absolutely no helpful information in the search for my missing cat. Unfortuately he was not recovered as of this date. 

**\- Carol Z**

I would not have found him without her help, and after 15 days it seemed impossible. She advised it would take time, and I needed to not give up easily. I would 100% recommend Lindsey over and over again. Thank you so much!

My dog was itching like crazy, and Lindsey come up with a change in the water. The itching did start when we moved to a new house, which had a well. Bottled water for my baby from now on.

We weren’t sure what to expect when we reached out to Lindsey. Lindsey helped us find our lost cat. We were extremely sad and worried that our cat was missing for serval days. At that point we were willing to try anything to find our cat. We ended up stumbling across Lindsey. I provided some details about my cat and within 24 hours she reached out to us. She provided us with useful detailed information about my cats wellbeing and where she is. After following the information she provided us we were able to locate her that same night. We will definitely be using her services again in the future to check in with our baby girl.

I was able to locate Nala, Brandon's Cat, and lead him right to her in real-time. They had her back home 2 days later. Working with Brandon to find Nala was the most rewarding experience I have had thus far in the psychic pet location & retrieval realm.

Lovely communication session. 

**\- Lindsey Latham**

My first cat, Lady, is sassy and the love of my life. Lindsey was able to connect to her and communicate back to me in a way that fits Lady so much that it had me grinning. Lol. I plan on diving deeper into connecting with my cat through Lindsey because of how well it went this time.

Thanks to Lindsey, my family was able to find my dearest Lou. Unfortunately she had passed, but if gave me the closure I so strongly needed. She is at peace and I can give her a proper memorial.

Lindsey was awesome!!!! She took extra steps by sending all notes and mapping of areas where the dog could possibly be located. She took extra time and answered all questions immediately. I highly recommend her!!

Lindsay was really helpful and intune with my pet who in in a doggie hospital, currently unwell. It was a very positive experience for me, and I’m am sure he has been excited from the reiki.

I am less than pleased and not impressed with Lindsey at all. I understand animal communication because I do that as well. My experience with her was like a wild goose chase and she was throwing darts at a wall that did not even exist. My husband and have searched everywhere and have looked at every place we possible could and still have not found him. Her guidance started by saying he was in one type of place and when that didn't prove him being found, she shifted to something totally different and looking in a direction toward something over a mile away that he would have no clue of. From against a house to a wide open field. My cat is still missing and I feel like it was not a fair exchange of energy since she worked with me one day and "rested" the next and now is only lighting a candle and can't do any more. I have more to say but will keep it for now. Have a blessed day and I will continue to search for my cat.

I worked with you for 4 days! On the 3rd day YES I had to rest! I also delivered your report a day early and did everything I could to help you. 

**\- Lindsey Latham**

My cat has been missing for over 10 days. After consulting many animal communicators without success, I was excited to begin working with Lindsey because of her wonderful reviews. People mentioned that she was supportive, answered questions quickly and went above and beyond with them. That was the furthest from the truth in my experience. I don’t wish the emotional rollercoaster that I experienced with her on anyone! 

She did not follow through on when she would submit the report more than once. The first time I was told by the afternoon at the latest so I was glued to my phone all morning. Then at 3:30 pm she said she would have it by late at night. I had told her that I had taken the day off from work to look for her that day and was hoping to have it by sundown. This is when she said soon and then I didn’t hear from her for 8 hours. She ignored my messages for hours and turned in the report at 3am the next morning past the 24hour mark that she said she wouldn’t pass. 

The report was vague, gave me a street name and little other information. Most of my questions went unanswered and I never found out about the state of my pet. She had told me she would be there that day to answer some questions but she wasn’t. This was the biggest waste of my money and caused me a level of anxiety I have rarely experienced. 

The reading was unprofessional and I compassionate to the max!

Although Lindsey was very nice, there was absolutely no helpful information in the search for my missing cat. Unfortuately he was not recovered as of this date.
