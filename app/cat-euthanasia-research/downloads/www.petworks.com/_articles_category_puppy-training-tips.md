Puppy Training Tips

Hiring a puppy trainer who is well-matched with your little one is essential for successful training and long-term positive outcomes. A certified puppy trainer brings a level of expertise and professionalism that ensures your pup receives the best possible education.

### Reputable Is Key

Certification from a reputable organization, such as the Association of Professional Dog Trainers (APDT) or the International Association of Canine Professionals (IACP), guarantees that the trainer has undergone rigorous training and adheres to high ethical standards.

### Certification Alone Isn’t Enough

Finding a puppy trainer who is well-matched with your puppy’s temperament, energy level, and learning style is equally important. A well-matched trainer will understand the unique needs of your puppy, whether it’s a high-energy breed requiring extra stimulation or a more sensitive puppy that needs gentle guidance. This compatibility ensures that training sessions are both effective and enjoyable, reducing stress for your puppy and leading to quicker, more lasting results. The right trainer will also take the time to build a rapport with your puppy, using positive reinforcement techniques tailored to your dog’s specific motivations, such as treats, toys, or praise.

### Learning Environment

This personalized approach fosters a positive learning environment where your puppy can thrive. Ultimately, finding and hiring a pro who is well-matched with your puppy, not only sets the foundation for good behavior but also strengthens the bond between you and your dog, making the training experience rewarding for both of you. The duration of puppy training can vary based on several factors, including the puppy’s age, breed, temperament, and the complexity of the desired behaviors.

Generally, basic obedience training can take anywhere from 4 to 6 weeks, with sessions typically lasting 45 minutes to an hour once or twice a week. However, achieving lasting results often requires ongoing practice and reinforcement beyond initial training.

[Puppy trainers](https://www.petworks.com/hire/puppy-trainer) typically charge between $75 and $150 per session, depending on their experience, location, and the complexity of the training required. Some trainers offer package deals for multiple sessions, which can often be more cost-effective. It’s important to shop around and compare different trainers to find one that fits your budget and meets your specific needs.

# Is This Just a Puppy Phase or a Real Problem?

If you’ve ever brushed off your puppy’s behavior with _“They’ll grow out of it,”_ you’re not alone. Jumping, biting, barking, pulling on the leash, chewing furniture. Many pet parents assume these behaviors are just part of puppyhood. Sometimes, they are. But sometimes, waiting is the most expensive decision you can make.

Knowing the difference between a **normal puppy phase** and a **developing behavior problem** can save you stress, money, and heartbreak later.

### **What Counts as a Normal Puppy Phase?**

Puppies experience predictable developmental stages, especially in their first 18 months. During these phases, certain behaviors are expected.

**Common puppy-phase behaviors include:**

  * Mouthiness and nipping during teething

  * Short attention spans

  * Occasional accidents during house training

  * Temporary fear periods

  * Bursts of high energy followed by deep sleep




These behaviors usually **improve with consistent guidance, structure, and age**.

> “Puppies explore the world with their mouths and emotions. What matters isn’t that these behaviors exist. It’s whether they’re improving over time.” – [**Dr. Ian Dunbar** , Veterinarian & Animal Behaviorist](https://www.siriuspup.com/about/staff/dr-ian-dunbar-phd-bvetmed-mrcvs)

* * *

### **When “They’ll Grow Out of It” Becomes a Problem**

The red flag isn’t the behavior itself — it’s **the pattern**.

If a behavior is **intensifying, spreading, or causing safety concerns** , it’s no longer just a phase.

### Signs It’s More Than a Puppy Phase

  * Biting that breaks skin or escalates with age

  * Jumping that knocks people over

  * Fear responses that turn into avoidance or aggression

  * Barking that worsens instead of settling

  * Destructive behavior linked to anxiety

  * Leash reactivity toward people or dogs

  * Inability to calm down even after exercise




> “Time alone doesn’t fix behavior. Skills fix behavior. And the longer a habit is practiced, the harder it is to undo.” – [**Pat Miller** , Certified Professional Dog Trainer & Author](https://peaceablepaws.com/about/)

* * *

### **Why Waiting Often Makes Behavior Problems Worse**

Behavior is learned through repetition. When puppies rehearse unwanted behaviors — even unintentionally — those behaviors become **default coping mechanisms**.

What starts as:

  * playful nipping

  * mild fear

  * excitement barking




can evolve into:

  * adult biting

  * reactivity

  * chronic anxiety




And adult dogs don’t get the same social grace as puppies.

> “People tolerate behaviors in puppies that would be unacceptable in adult dogs. By the time they seek help, the dog has had months or years of practice.” – [**Karen Pryor** , Behavioral Scientist & Trainer](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/vets/biopryor.html)

* * *

### **The Hidden Cost of “Waiting It Out”**

Many pet parents delay training to save money — but early intervention is almost always cheaper.

**Delaying help can lead to:**

  * More intensive (and expensive) training later

  * Limited housing or travel options

  * Injuries to people or other pets

  * Emotional burnout for pet parents

  * Rehoming or surrender in severe cases




Early guidance often means **fewer sessions, faster results, and less stress**.

### **Puppy Phase vs. Real Problem: A Quick Comparison**

**Likely a Puppy Phase if:**

  * Behavior improves week to week

  * Puppy responds to redirection

  * Intensity decreases with structure

  * No fear or aggression involved




**Likely a Real Problem if:**

  * Behavior escalates with age

  * Puppy ignores or resists guidance

  * Fear, anxiety, or aggression appears

  * Daily life revolves around managing behavior




* * *

### **When to Seek Professional Help**

You don’t need to wait for a crisis to get support.

Consider working with a [puppy trainer](https://www.petworks.com/hire/puppy-trainer) or [canine behavior professional](https://www.petworks.com/hire/dog-behaviorist) if:

  * You feel overwhelmed or frustrated

  * Progress has stalled

  * Safety is a concern

  * Advice online feels contradictory

  * You’re saying “maybe next month” — repeatedly




> “The best time to get help is when you first ask yourself whether you need it.” – [**Victoria Stilwell** , Dog Trainer & Behavior Expert](https://positively.com/)

* * *

### **It’s Not a Failure — It’s Responsible Parenting**

Needing help doesn’t mean you failed your puppy. It means you’re paying attention.

Most serious behavior problems don’t start as emergencies — they start as **small concerns that were easy to ignore**.

“Most serious behavior problems don’t start as emergencies. They start as small issues pet parents were told to wait out. Time doesn’t change behavior. Guidance does.” – **Kevin Kinyon, Co-Founder, PetWorks**

### **Frequently Asked Questions**

### Will my puppy grow out of biting?

Some mouthiness improves naturally, but biting that escalates, causes injury, or continues past teething often needs professional guidance.

### At what age do dogs calm down?

Many dogs mature emotionally between 18–36 months, but without training, unwanted behaviors often remain — just in a larger body.

### Can separation anxiety go away on its own?

True separation anxiety rarely resolves without intervention and often worsens if untreated.

### Is it ever too early to [hire a dog trainer](https://www.petworks.com/hire/dog-trainer)?

No. Early guidance is usually faster, cheaper, and more effective than fixing ingrained behaviors later.

### Am I overreacting by getting help?

Most pet parents who seek help early wish they’d done it sooner — not later.

If you’re asking _“Is this just a phase?”_ that question alone is worth listening to.

Puppies grow.  
Habits grow faster.
