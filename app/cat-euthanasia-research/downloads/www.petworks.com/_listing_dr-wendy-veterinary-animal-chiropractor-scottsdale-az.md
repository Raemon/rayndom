# Dr. Wendy - Veterinary Animal Chiropractor - Scottsdale, AZ

Verified Member since Jan 2024 

As a dedicated pet chiropractor and certified animal wellness expert, I bring over two decades of experience since earning my Doctor of Chiropractic (DC) degree from Cleveland Chiropractic in Los Angeles back in 2000. My journey in veterinary chiropractic began in 2006 when I became a Certified Veterinary Chiropractitioner (CVCP), working alongside a CVCP Veterinarian in Los Angeles before relocating to Phoenix. My qualifications extend to being an Advanced Animal Acupressurist and Massage Therapist (AAAMT), a Certified Animal Massage Therapist, a Certified Equine Sports Massage Therapist (CESMT), and I am American Red Cross Pet First Aid and CPR Certified. My diverse skill set allows me to effectively address a variety of health and mobility issues in dogs, cats, and horses.

I am passionate about providing tailored chiropractic care and therapeutic treatments that promote the well-being of your beloved pets. My services include massage, stretching, acupressure, and chiropractic adjustments, proven to alleviate conditions such as hip dysplasia and lameness, particularly in dogs. After witnessing the transformative effects of these therapies on my own dog, I am committed to offering the same relief and improved quality of life to your pets. Whether it's improving mobility in a senior cat or enhancing performance in a competitive horse, I am here to support their health journey.

I offer convenient mobile services within the Phoenix area, ensuring that your pet's wellness care is both accessible and stress-free. My 48-hour cancellation policy gives you flexibility and peace of mind when scheduling. If you're ready to see your pet thrive, I invite you to book my expert services through Petworks today!

Muscular Release and Adjustment

$ 159.00 Per 45 minutes [book](/dr-wendy-veterinary-animal-chiropractor-scottsdale-az/book?id=7375)

Manipulations of an Animal’s spine is best when releasing the tight muscles that surround the area in order for the adjustment to hold. Muscular Imbalances lead to the muscles twisting and pulling the spine out of place which will impinge the associated nerve. This can lead to lameness or pain with your Pet. When the muscles are released they are able to relax creating more range of motion, less pain and the relief they need. I like to focus on the applied kinesiology aspect & acupuncture meridians with animals. It is common for animals to have muscular knots inhibiting their activity levels. By releasing these stubborn muscles, it will lead to a better quality of life for your animal.
