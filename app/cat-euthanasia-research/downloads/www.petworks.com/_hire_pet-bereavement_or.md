**PAA**

**What is pet bereavement counseling, and how can it help me cope with the loss of my pet?**

Pet bereavement counseling offers emotional support and guidance for grieving pet parents. Whether you've recently lost a dog, cat, or another beloved animal companion, a trained counselor in Oregon helps you navigate the stages of grief, process your emotions, and find meaningful ways to honor your pet's memory. Many parents have found comfort and healing through compassionate, pet-focused grief counseling.

**How much does pet bereavement counseling typically cost in Oregon?**

The cost of pet bereavement counseling in Oregon generally ranges from $50 to $150 per session, depending on the counselor’s experience, session length, and whether it’s in-person or virtual. Some counselors offer sliding-scale rates or discounted packages for multiple sessions. It’s always helpful to ask about pricing and payment options upfront.

**Can I get pet bereavement support online if I live in a rural area of Oregon?**

Yes, absolutely. Many certified grief counselors offer virtual pet bereavement support sessions via video call, making it easy to connect with a professional no matter where you live in Oregon. Remote sessions provide the same level of compassion and support as in-person visits, and they allow you to grieve and heal in the comfort of your own home.
