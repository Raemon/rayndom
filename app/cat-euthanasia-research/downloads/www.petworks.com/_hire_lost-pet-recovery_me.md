**What should I do first if my dog or cat goes missing in Maine?**

If your pet goes missing, act immediately. Search your home and yard, check nearby streets, and alert local shelters and vets.

**How can I increase the chances of finding my lost pet in Maine?**

Act quickly and thoroughly: expand your search area, notify shelters, hang flyers, and post online. Ask neighbors to check garages and sheds. Consider advanced methods such as GPS tracking, scent dogs, or network alerts. Booking a professional lost pet finder on Petworks 🏠 gives you experienced support and proven strategies to maximize the chance of reuniting with your pet.
