**What is Animal Chiropractic?**

Animal chiropractic is a holistic therapy that focuses on spinal alignment, joint mobility, and nervous system function. Licensed animal chiropractors use hands-on adjustments to reduce pain, improve posture, and enhance athletic performance. Chiropractic care can be preventive or corrective, supporting pets with injuries, arthritis, hip dysplasia, or mobility issues. 

**Benefits of Animal Chiropractic Care**

Pain relief: Helps manage arthritis, back pain, and joint discomfort. 

Improved mobility: Supports range of motion in hips, shoulders, and spine. 

Enhanced athletic performance: Beneficial for working dogs, agility dogs, and performance horses. 

Preventive wellness: Maintains spinal health and overall balance for long-term well-being. 

Support recovery: Complements veterinary care for injuries or post-surgical rehabilitation. 

**Typical Animal Chiropractic Costs in 2026**

Costs vary by species, session length, and practitioner experience: 

Dogs and cats: $60–$150 per session 

Horses and large animals: $100–$250 per session 

Package programs: $250–$800 for multi-session programs 

Factors affecting cost include travel, complexity of care, and integration with other therapies like physical therapy or massage. 

**What to Look for in an Animal Chiropractor**

Licensing & Certification: Ensure the chiropractor is licensed or certified in animal chiropractic and complies with state veterinary regulations. 

Experience: Look for practitioners experienced with your pet’s species and conditions. 

Holistic Approach: They should collaborate with your veterinarian for safe and effective care. 

Technique & Safety: Sessions should be gentle, species-appropriate, and tailored to your pet’s needs. 

**Tips Before Your Pet’s First Session**

Bring your pet’s medical history and veterinary records. 

Observe your pet for pain or mobility concerns to share with the chiropractor. 

Ask about the number of recommended sessions and follow-up care. 

Ensure the chiropractor explains techniques, goals, and expected outcomes. 

**Animal Chiropractic FAQs**

**1\. What conditions can animal chiropractic help?**

It can help arthritis, hip dysplasia, back or neck pain, mobility issues, sports injuries, and post-surgical rehabilitation. 

**2\. Is animal chiropractic safe for my pet?**

Yes, when performed by a licensed, certified animal chiropractor. Adjustments are gentle and tailored to the species and size of your pet. 

**3\. How many sessions will my pet need?**

Frequency varies by condition; some pets improve after 1–2 sessions, while chronic or complex conditions may require ongoing care or package programs. 

**4\. Do I need a referral from my veterinarian?**

While not always required, most chiropractors work in collaboration with your veterinarian to ensure safe, coordinated care. 

**5\. What should I expect during a session?**

The chiropractor will assess posture, gait, and spinal alignment, perform gentle adjustments, and may suggest exercises or follow-up plans. 

**6\. Can young or senior pets receive chiropractic care?**

Yes. Sessions are tailored for age, size, and health condition, making it safe for puppies, kittens, seniors, and even animals with special needs. 

**7\. How do I choose the right animal chiropractor?**

Check credentials, experience with your pet’s species, reviews from other pet parents, and their collaboration with veterinarians. Ask about session length, cost, and techniques used.
