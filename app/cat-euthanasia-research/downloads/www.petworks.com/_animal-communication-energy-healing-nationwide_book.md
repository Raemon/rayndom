### [Animal Communication & Energy Healing - Nationwide](/en/listing/508896) by [Kimberly Kerr](/en/user/sit_stay_heal)

Animal Communication Grief Sessions

$44 Per 15 Minutes 

First, I am so sorry for the loss of your dear loved one. They always hold a place in our hearts and it is always a comfort to know that they are around us still. 

In the animal communication grief session, we will connect with your animal in spirit, and ask your animal how they are feeling about their transition, and how they are doing now that they are in spirit. We will ask what their purpose was in your life and you in theirs, as well as how they show themselves to you now. 

Please provide a photo of the animal, sex, and age that they passed. This will better ensure we are bringing in the beloved you are longing to hear from.

Animal Communication Session

$44 Per 15 Minutes 

If we haven’t worked together before, then the best way to begin is by booking a 15-minute session. We may not get to cover all areas in 15 minutes, but we can touch on the most important and you can always book another session if you feel guided to do so. 

You’re in the right place if you’re looking to:

\- Better understand what your animal companions want + need   
\- Support their health + wellbeing through energy work   
\- Achieve more interspecies household harmony   
\- Connect with your beloved animals in spirit after they’ve died   
\- Receive trauma-informed grief support before, during, and after the loss of a pet

All of my services are virtual so we can work together no matter where you are.

I’d be honored to support you and your animal companions in reaching new levels of understanding and healing in all seasons of life and beyond.

Animal Communication & Energy Healing

The 45-minute sessions are best for those who either have worked with me before and we know your animal would benefit from energy healing, or you just feel you would like a more comprehensive session with energy healing.

You’re in the right place if you’re looking to:

\- Better understand what your animal companions want + need   
\- Support their health + wellbeing through energy work   
\- Achieve more interspecies household harmony   
\- Connect with your beloved animals in spirit after they’ve died   
\- Receive trauma-informed grief support before, during, and after the loss of a pet
