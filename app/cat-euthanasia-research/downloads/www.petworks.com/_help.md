#  Frequently asked questions 

For Pet Parents

**  
**

**How do I book a Petworks pet care service professional?**

Please see our [pet parent tutorial page](https://www.petworks.com/articles/pet-parent-tutorial-how-to-book/) which explains in steps, how you can book a Petworks pet care service professional on our platform. 

**  
**

**What can I find on Petworks?**

A better question might be, what can't you find on Petworks? Our professionals fill every niche of the pet industry. We are truly your one-stop shop for pet health, wellness, and time of need pet care.

  


**How much does it cost to book through Petworks?**

There’s no cost to browse or connect with our nationwide network of trusted pet care professionals. You only pay when you book a service. When you book and pay through Petworks, a 10% Care Coverage fee is added to your total at checkout. Care Coverage is our promise to support you and your pet every step of the way. It includes access to our live, human Concierge Team, full refunds if a booking is canceled through no fault of your own, and help resolving any booking disputes. All to give you peace of mind while your pet gets the care she deserves.

  


**Am I required to book and pay on the Petworks Platform? And if so, why?** Yes. Bookings transacted and paid-for outside of the Petworks platform are strictly prohibited. When a booking is transacted/paid-for outside of the Petworks platform, Petworks cannot guarantee recovery of any external funds exchanged between pet parents and pet pros. All bookings are to be transacted and paid-for, in full, on the Petworks platform. This also helps Petworks resolve disagreements in the rare instance there is a booking dispute between a pet parent and a pet pro. 

  


**What kind of pets do your pros serve?**

When people think of pets, they often call to mind the more common ones - cats, dogs, fish, birds, rabbits. Here at Petworks, our list goes way beyond that! Our pet pros serve all kinds of family members - whether they're furry, fluffy, feathery, scale-y, soft, spiky or slimy!  


  


**How do I find pet pros in my area?**

Good question! All you have to do is decide what kind of pet pro you're looking for, click on that category on our homepage, and explore the list of pros near you! For example, if you are looking for an animal chiropractor, you would click on the 'animal chiropractic' category and we'll show you a list of dedicated, passionate pros in your area. Easy, right?  


  


**What does it mean if a pet pro is certified?**

A pet pro that has a check mark next to 'Certified' on their listing has verified to us that they (or their business) have received professional certifications to work with your pet in their field. You will also see that many pros have specified what kind of licensing they have by indicating if they have a Business License or are a Licensed Clinical Psychologist, Licensed Creative Arts Therapist or Licensed Mental Health Counselor (LMHC).  


  


**What does it mean if a pet business is bonded and insured?**

When a pet business is bonded, it means they have purchased a surety bond, which provides financial protection to their clients in case the business fails to fulfill its obligations or commits any misconduct. When a pet business is insured, it means they have obtained insurance coverage, offering protection against various risks, such as property damage, liability claims, or employee injuries, depending on the type of insurance they hold.  


  


**What is the best way to contact a pet pro on Petworks?**

Once you explore our list of pros, we're sure you'll find something your pet needs - or maybe something you didn't even know they needed! When you do, the best way to contact a pro is by sending them a message. On every listing underneath a pro's profile icon on the right-hand side, there is the option to 'Send Message.' Your message goes directly to their Petworks inbox as well as their business email to ensure they don't miss it!  


  


**What happens after I submit a quote request to a pet pro?**

Once you submit a booking request, each pet pro you select will respond to you with a customized message based on your needs for that service. You will receive an alert from us anytime a pet pro sends you a message - so you won't ever miss a thing!  


  


**Can I pay online?**

Absolutely! Many of our pet pros have set up online payments. Pros who have the 'Book Now' link on their listing allow you to submit your payment directly through the site using Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, Apple Pay, Google Pay, Affirm, Link, and Klarna.   


  


**How long does it take pros to accept a booking?**

Once you submit your payment info for one of our pet pros, they have 3 days to accept or decline the booking. If they accept, your credit card will be charged.   


  


**What if a pet pro doesn't accept my booking?**

Sometimes a pet pro may need to decline your booking. Don't worry - your credit card will not be charged if this happens. Whatev-fur their reason may be, feel free to contact our team to help you find another qualified pro for the job!  


  


**How does scheduling work? Can I pick a time that works for me?**  
In many cases, yes! Some pet pros allow you to choose a session time based on their real-time availability. When that's the case, you'll be able to select an open time slot from their calendar. The times are shown in the pet pro's local time zone, but don't worry - we'll clearly show you what that means in your own time zone and highlight the time difference. Once you schedule, both you and the pet pro will receive a calendar invite with all the details, including a Google Meet link if the session is virtual.

  


**How do I mark a booking complete?**

Once a pet pro has delivered their service to you successfully, we ask that you log back into your account and mark the booking complete. You will also be able to leave a rating & review for the pro at this time.  


  


**What if I need to cancel a booking?**

If you need to cancel a booking, the first thing to do is message the pet pro and let them know. That way, they can adjust their schedule accordingly. Then, if you need to request a refund, please email [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), and we'll get it processed for you as quickly as possible.  


  


**What do I do if a pet pro doesn't deliver their service as promised?**

Oh no! We hope this won't happen, but want to help you resolve the issue as quickly as possible if it does. We recommend communicating directly with the pet pro first, to discuss what went wrong and how best to move forward. Our team will also be notified to help you navigate the situation and find a solution.  


  


**Can I leave a review afterwards?**

Yes, please do! It would be-hoof you and other pet parents to leave reviews! We are proud of the work our pet pros do and want to show our appreciation when they make a difference in the lives of your pets. If for some reason they were not up to your standards, your review helps them improve their business and guides other pet parents who are looking for the purr-fect pet pro! Petworks reserves the right to remove offensive, derogatory, or defaming reviews at our discretion.   


  


**Can I leave a tip for a pet pro that went above and beyond?**

Yes, after you leave a review, there's an optional tip form. Note that Petworks does not collect its normal service fee on tips, and we don't withhold any booking fees from the pet pros. The only fees are the payment processing fees that are charged by Stripe (approximately 2.9% plus 30 cents)

  


**What is the benefit to booking through Petworks?**

When you book and pay through Petworks, you’re backed by Care Coverage — our promise to support both you and your pet every step of the way. Care Coverage includes access to our live, human Concierge Team, full refunds if your booking is ever canceled, and help resolving any booking disputes. It’s all designed to give you peace of mind, so you can focus on what matters most: caring for your pet.

  


**How long has Petworks been around?**

Petworks, as it currently exists today, launched in 2021. There was an earlier version of the platform called 'Petmasters', but the founders decided to re-launch it as Petworks in 2021.  


  


**How can I contact Petworks?**

Yes, you can (and should!) include a Youtube video with your listing.  


  


**Can I include a website link or contact information in my description?**

We ask that you refrain from including website links, email addresses, and phone numbers in your description, pricing packages, and auto-responder message. You ARE permitted to provide contact information after you've had an initial messaging through our platform. We recognize this may be necessary to schedule appointments.  


  


**What is the ideal size for a listing photo?**

The best size photo for the website is 960px wide by 540px tall (16:9 ratio). If the photo is a different ratio, the website will crop the photo. Photos must be jpg, png, or gif. If you have problems upload photos, please feel free to send the photos to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) and we will upload them for you.  


  


**How will I be alerted a pet parent is contacting me?**

Be on the look out for texts and emails with the subject line  _"A Petworks Parent is Asking For You"_ which means a pet parent has contacted you. We recommend you whitelist the email address  _[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)_ so these important message alert emails don't end up in your junk/spam folder.  


  


**How does the booking process work?**

Here is a [helpful YouTube video](https://youtu.be/AeCfjVCTtMg) which is a great tutorial explaining the Petworks platform booking process.  


**  
**

**Can I connect my calendar to manage scheduling more easily?**  
Yes. You can connect your Google Calendar to Petworks. When you accept a booking, you’ll have the option to let the pet parent choose a time based on your real-time availability. If you enable this, they’ll be able to schedule the session directly. Once they do, both of you will receive a calendar invite that includes a Google Meet link, perfect for virtual sessions. Your availability will always reflect your local time zone, and pet parents will be notified if there’s a time difference.****

  


**How do I add or modify my pricing?**

Assuming you are logged into Petworks, you can add, edit, and delete pricing packages by going to https://www.petworks.com/pricing-packages  


  


**How do pet parents pay me?**

Once you enroll in online payments, pet parents book you online using Visa, Mastercard, American Express, or Discover. Our payments are powered by Stripe.

  


**Why is there a $50 minimum for new bookings?**

We set a $50 minimum for first-time bookings to benefit both pet pros and the Petworks community. Many providers unintentionally undervalue their services. The $50 minimum encourages the creation of pricing packages (for example, 3 sessions for $120) that provide better value for clients while ensuring pros are fairly compensated. For Petworks, very small, one-time bookings make it difficult for us to cover operating costs. The $50 minimum allows us to continue growing the platform, attracting more pet parents, and supporting our pros.

  


👉 Note: This minimum applies only to _first-time bookings_. For re-bookings with existing clients, there’s no minimum.

  


**I'm reluctant to give you my banking information. Is it secure?**

We use [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/security) to handle all of our payment processing. They are the industry leader in online payments with over $12 billion in annual revenue, and top level security & encryption in place. Their clients include Amazon, Google, and Shopify - just to name a few. You would be providing your information to Stripe, not to Petworks.   


  


**Can I join Petworks without using your payment system?**

Unfortunately, you won't be able to list your services with Petworks without enrolling in our payment system.  


  


**How long do I have to accept a booking?**

You have 3 days. It's important that you respond within this timeframe because if you don't do so within 3 days, the transaction will automatically be cancelled and the pet parent will not be charged.  


  


**Can I decline a booking?**

Yes, you have the option to accept or decline a booking. If you decline the booking, the pet parent's credit card will not be charged. We recommend communicating directly with pet parents if you decline a booking due to a conflict with date or time. You may be able to reschedule or propose a new plan of action.  


  


**After I get booked, when do I get paid?**

When a pet parent books your service and you accept the booking, their credit card is charged. The funds will then automatically be transferred by Stripe to your bank account on file. This takes two business days, although the very first payment you receive through Petworks may take three business days. Please note that if you're a pet transportation service or a flight nanny, you get paid after you've provided the service to the pet parent who booked you. ****  


  


**I'm a flight nanny and/or a pet transportation service. After I get booked, when do I get paid?**

Petworks pays you once you've provided the transport service to the pet parent who booked you. All expenses you incur in order to prepare for transport (this includes airline ticket purchases) and during the actual transporting of the parent's pet(s) are your responsibility to cover. Petworks is not in the business of lending or "fronting" money in order for you to operate your pet transport business. Once you've completed the transportation of the pet parent's pet, Petworks will securely transfer the pet parent's payment into your bank account on file. The funds will then reach your account in two business days. 

  


**How do I update my bank information on file?**

You can do by logging into your pet pro dashboard, and clicking on the 'Accept Payments' tab. There you will see an 'Edit Details' link that will allow you to update your bank information on file.

**  
**

**How do I pay Petworks the booking fee?**

Once you are enrolled in the [Petworks booking program](https://www.petworks.com/payments) (powered by Stripe), the booking fee will be automatically be withheld from your payout. This will happen automatically.

  1. 


  


**How do I refund a customer who paid me through Petworks?**

If you need to refund a pet parent for any reason, just send an email to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). Let us know whether it's a full or partial refund, and if partial, what the amount is. We'll process the refund for you, and we will send a receipt to the pet parent.

  


**What do I do if a pet parent disputes a booking?**

If a pet parent feels that your service has not been delivered as promised, they have the right to dispute it. We recommend communicating directly with the pet parent to find out what went wrong and how best to move forward. Our team will also be notified, to help you and the pet parent navigate the situation and find a solution quickly.  


  


**What if you don't have my category?**

If your unique service is missing from our website, please [send us an email](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7704020707180503370712030018051c045914181a) and let us know what you're all about! In the meantime, you can always create a listing under the 'Other Pet Specialities' category. This category holds some of our most unique pet services that may not be as well known or frequently used - but that doesn't make them any less special!   


  


**How can pet parents rate/review me?**

After a pet parent has booked and used your services, they will have the option to write a review and rate the quality of their experience with you, which other pet parents will then be able to see.   


  


**How do pet parents find Petworks?**

Our pet parents find us primarily through Google and Facebook - though we are ramping up our marketing on Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn as well. With Google, they may do a keyword search and one of our pages comes up or they may notice a paid ad on the right-hand side. Some pet parents view us on other websites that participate in Google's display ad network. On Facebook, people may come across our website as a result of a piece of content that their Facebook friend shared or commented on, or they may see one of our paid ads in their newsfeed.  


  


**What geographic areas does Petworks cover?**

Petworks is a nationwide platform, with pet professionals listed in every state of the U.S. When pet parents want to find a pet pro, they simply choose a category and explore the list of purr-fessionals near them!  


  


**Can I create a listing if I'm not in the U.S.?**

We are currently focused on building up our community of pet pros and pet parents within the United States. For this reason, we're only looking for pet lovers in the United States to join us (for now!)  


  


**Can i create an additional listing?**

Yes, assuming you are already logged into Petworks, you can create an additional listing [here](https://www.petworks.com/en/listings/new): Please keep in mind that in order to qualify for a 2nd listing page, you need one of the following: A) A separate physical business location which is at least 75 miles from your current location OR

B) A different pet care category than what you already have listed in your original listing. This can be in the same location.

  


**How can I contribute original content to Petworks?**

We pride ourselves on creating a platform for useful, original, and information-rich content that is driven by pet industry pros like yourself! After all, you are the experts - and we can all learn a lot from you! If you have a piece of content to contribute, please send it to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) and we'll happily review it. The format can be Microsoft Word, Google Doc or PDF. Typical posts are about 1,000 words (but we're flexible!). Be sure to include 1-3 photos with the article along with author bio and author thumbnail photo. If your piece is selected for publication, your services and published post may receive additional promotional credit from us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and more!  


  


**What if I want to cancel my membership?**

Please drop an email to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) and we'll get it taken care asap. We can't promise we won't try to talk you out it!   


  


**I have a legacy subscription membership. How do I update the credit/debit card information on file?**

While there's not a way at this time to update your credit card information through the Petworks dashboard, you can request that we send you a link that will allow you to securely update your billing information. To request this link, please send an email to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), and we'll get that to you as quickly as possible.
