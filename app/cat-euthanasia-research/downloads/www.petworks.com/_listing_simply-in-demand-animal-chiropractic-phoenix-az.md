# Simply In Demand Animal Chiropractic - Phoenix, AZ

(5 reviews)

Verified Member since Aug 2019 

Dr Meier DC/CVCP uses: VOM (Veterinary Orthopedic Manipulation) Technology - is Chiropractic Neurological resetting. A special instrument is used to adjust the animal. The animal can not be hurt with VOM. It just flipps the "switch" that is in the off position in the patients neurology back "on". For some is could be instant, most see results in 3-5 treatments, some may take longer.

VOM is used to accurately detect, predict, treat and prevent diseases in the domestic mammal. Early detection and treatment begets disease prediction and prevention.

Dr Meier DC/CVCP has worked on Guinea Pigs/Cats/Dogs/Horses. Anything with a spine may be adjusted with VOM Technique (providing the animal cooperates). VOM is best used for the following conditions:   
\- Hip Dysplasia-like syndrome   
\- Canine Wobbler's disease   
\- IV disc disease   
\- Urinary & fecal incontinences   
\- Avulsion of the brachial plexus   
\- generative myelopathy syndromes   
\- so-called myelopathy syndromes   
\- Esophageal achalasia, reflux esophagitis, megaesophagus   
\- GI hyper and hypo motility diseases   
\- Recurrent ear and eye infections   
\- Unilateral nerve paralysis / paresis   
\- Lick granulomas   
\- VOM as an adjunct to orthopedic surgery   
\- Accelerated healing benefits   
\- Diseases of the knee   
\- Many others

Laser acupuncture can treat over 2000 different health related conditions including Anxiety... the list goes on.

We do charge more for the first visit as it requires the Doctor to get to know the pet and understand the history of the condition. Estimates for first visit are $119-$189 depending. After first visit depending on level of treatment required price may reduce to nearly 1/2. Always best to inquire for a proper assessment. We take care to be precise in our treatments and do the very best for your loved friend.

Please contact and book us on Petworks. Thank you.

Hours of study, having health problems with my own pets and not believing medicine and surgery was the answer. Having one of my own dogs diagnosed with lymphoma and 2 weeks to live if I did not do chemotherapy. I said no, took him home and adjusted him with VOM technique and did laser acupuncture on him 3 times a day for 2 weeks. When we returned to the veterinarian for testing they said, "we must have mis-diagnosed." I see miracles in my office.

Less is more! Less medications, less toxins, more proactive approaches to alternative therapies.

#### What is one thing you want pet parents to know about you? It can be whatev-fur you'd like!

I'm an animal lover, my dobermans come to the office with me every day. They are the greeters and guides in the office to take patients back to be adjusted and to take them back to therapy. Animals are a reflection of their owners.

Dr Meier truly cares about her patients. She offers a wide variety of services to help you get back on the road to optimal health! Not only does she offer treatment for people but she loves and treats animals too. It has been a while but my husband was in to see Dr Meier. She has a gentle, thorough approach. Again, she truly cares. - Phoenix, AZ

**\- Tawn S**

After walking in and talking to Dr. Kelli Meier about my dogs' timid behavior, I felt comfortable to schedule an appointment. Dr. Meier applied acupressure to my dog and ordered drops to give her when she is over anxious or before a car ride. I could not believe the immediate change an Ani. Instead of hiding in the footwell of the car as she always does, she wanted to sit on the seat and look out the window. I even took a picture because this was so unbelievable! A few days a week I apply pressure to calming points which has helped when hot air balloons invade our air space. I will need to take her in for another treatment for maintenance, but it is well worth it. Dr. Meier worked so well with Ani. I definitely recommend visiting Simply in Demand for your 4-legged friends! Update: After 2 weeks, my dog is still doing amazing. Her anxiety is much lower than usual. Instead of hiding under the table shaking during the morning hot air balloon times... She is still nervous but laying on the floor close by me. The shaking is much less. Thank you Dr. Meier! You've helped my Ani become so much happier! - Phoenix, Arizona
