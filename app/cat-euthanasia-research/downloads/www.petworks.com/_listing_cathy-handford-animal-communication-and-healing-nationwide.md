This service is designed to meet your needs: whether you’re sharing a healing journey with your pet, processing grief, facing personal health challenges, or supporting multiple pets in one session. 

Animals may absorb the emotional and energetic burdens of their human companions, sometimes mirroring or even taking on our ailments out of love and loyalty. But people also need direct support—for themselves, their pets, or both together.

Healing Package: Three 60-Minute Sessions for You and/or Your Pets

$ 350.00 Per Package [book](/cathy-handford-animal-communication-and-healing-nationwide/book?id=8017)

Healing isn’t one-size-fits-all. Sometimes people seek support for themselves—processing grief, easing chronic illness, or releasing old emotional patterns. Other times, pets need focused care, or an entire furry family benefits from being included together. And often, person and pet share physical or emotional burdens that are best addressed side by side.

This 3-session package is designed to support you in the way you most need—gently, thoroughly, and with lasting transformation. Over the course of three 60-minute sessions, we’ll uncover and release the energetic, emotional, and physical patterns contributing to imbalance.

Using advanced techniques from ThetaHealing® and EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique), I create a safe, compassionate space for healing—whether the focus is you, your pets, or both together.

Package includes:   
✨ Three 60-minute sessions (for yourself, your pets, or shared)   
✨ A personalized healing approach tailored to your circumstances   
✨ Tools and practices to support healing between sessions

You’ll not only feel relief and renewal, but also deepen the connection, understanding, and peace within yourself and with your animal companions.

⏰ Session dates and times will be arranged via text after purchase. Most first sessions are scheduled within 24 hours, and same-day emergency sessions are available when needed. Please send a clear photo of your animal before the session.

✨ Bonus: Refer two people and receive a free 20-minute session!

Quantum Clearing™ for Homes – Support for Pets & Their People

$ 50.00 Per Session [book](/cathy-handford-animal-communication-and-healing-nationwide/book?id=8018)

Your home holds energy—from past owners, daily stress, environmental factors, and even unseen influences. Pets are highly sensitive to these energetic imprints and often absorb stress, anxiety, or fear that doesn’t belong to them.

This remote Quantum Clearing™ session is designed to release low-frequency energies from your home and replace them with high-vibrational frequencies like peace, safety, and love—creating a more supportive space for both you and your animal companions.

This service includes:   
✨ Remote energy clearing of your home, yard, and any outbuildings   
✨ Removal of emotional residue, past trauma, and stuck energies   
✨ Infusion of calming, uplifting frequencies to support your pet’s well-being   
✨ Optional insight on energetic sensitivities affecting your pet

Whether your pet is acting out, anxious, withdrawn, or just not themselves, the energy in your home could be a contributing factor. Quantum Clearing™ helps restore balance so both of you can thrive.

No in-person visit required – clearing is done remotely and results are shared with you by message or call.

Let’s create a peaceful, energetically aligned home—for everyone under your roof.

BONUS - If you refer 2 people to me, you will get a free 20-minute session!

🐾 Lost Pet Support & Communication: A Different Approach

$ 50.00 Per Session [book](/cathy-handford-animal-communication-and-healing-nationwide/book?id=8510)

When a beloved pet goes missing, fear and uncertainty can be overwhelming. My approach to lost pets is different from many traditional animal communication methods—and it’s guided by your animal’s awareness and connection to all things.   
✨ How My Approach Is Different   
Many animal communicators focus on:   
• “Seeing through the animal’s eyes” to identify landmarks nearby   
• Using tools such as pendulums or maps to discern a physical location   
While these methods can help, they are often limited—especially as time passes.   
✨ My Process   
I begin by communicating directly with your animal to understand their current situation and intentions. From there:   
• I determine whether your pet wants to return home and is able to do so   
• If appropriate, I work with the elements and the Law of Oneness, engaging the natural energetic networks your animal already responds to instinctively   
• Rather than sending you out searching, I support your pet in being energetically guided toward home   
This method honors the way animals naturally navigate the world—through intuition, resonance, and connection—rather than forcing a human framework onto their experience.   
✨ If Time Has Passed   
If your pet has been gone for weeks or months, I can often provide clarity around:   
• Whether they are alive   
• If they are being fed or cared for by someone   
• The general conditions they are experiencing   
If your pet has passed, I can connect with them to offer you closure and peace. In many cases, animals who have crossed over remain very close to their people and may even be present with you during the session.   
✨ Important Note on Expectations   
Lost pet cases are complex. No method—intuitive or practical—can guarantee physical recovery, especially after the first several days. For this reason, I offer this service at the minimum rate allowed on Petworks ($50). My intention is to make compassionate support accessible during a stressful time, while being honest about the challenges involved.   
💫 While outcomes vary, many clients find this session comforting and helpful in determining what steps—energetic or practical—are most aligned moving forward.

Through hundreds of hours of training, practice, and heart-to-heart sessions with animals and their people over the past four years. I’ve studied with world-recognized teachers in ThetaHealing®, Communication with All Life University (CWALU), and Free mE® EFT, refining my intuitive accuracy and deepening my ability to translate what animals truly feel and need.

#### What tip would you give pet parents for working with animals that you've learned as a pro?

Patience, presence, and love heal more than any command ever could. When you slow down, listen with your heart, and meet your animal where they are, they naturally open up and show you exactly what they need. Gentle consistency builds trust—and trust transforms everything.

#### What is one thing you want pet parents to know about you? It can be whatev-fur you'd like!

I’ve shared my life with animals big and small—from breeding and riding horses to caring for a donkey, chickens, cats, and my beloved dog. Each one has been both teacher and healer for me. Their wisdom inspires every session I offer, and I bring that same compassion and respect to your animals as if they were my own.

**\- Cathy Handford**

I'm very grateful to Cathy for the quality of her assistance for my cats. She gave them healing, gave me peace of mind and ideas on what to do for them and I was very impressed with how true the communications she had with them were (they told her things I'd noticed but not told her). She also is very kind and personable so it was overall very pleasant as well as helpful. She's the real deal.

##### Pet Pro's Response:

Thank you so much Miriam. I love all that you do for your kitties!!

**\- Cathy Handford**

Was awesome. I reached out to see if there was an unaddressed issues with one of my three cats who has been extra vocal and clingy lately. I received so much more than expected as Cathy was guided to do a clearing of my home, check in with my other two cats, and help identify residual effects on my house since a roomer moved out a few weeks ago. Grateful!

It’s a little early yet to determine if Cathy’s reading on my Rottie’s injury turns out to be accurate or not. However, everything that she said made sense and rang true to me. Also, Cathy did some healing energy on our dog — and Lexi has been sleeping soundly all afternoon. Cathy also provided some advice on things we could try to alleviate some logistical problems due to Lexi’s injury. Overall, I was very pleased with my first time using an animal communicator and I wouldn’t hesitate to call on Cathy again!

#### What year did you begin serving pets?

#### How did you hone your craft?

Through hundreds of hours of training, practice, and heart-to-heart sessions with animals and their people over the past four years. I’ve studied with world-recognized teachers in ThetaHealing®, Communication with All Life University (CWALU), and Free mE® EFT, refining my intuitive accuracy and deepening my ability to translate what animals truly feel and need.

#### What tip would you give pet parents for working with animals that you've learned as a pro?

Patience, presence, and love heal more than any command ever could. When you slow down, listen with your heart, and meet your animal where they are, they naturally open up and show you exactly what they need. Gentle consistency builds trust—and trust transforms everything.

#### What is one thing you want pet parents to know about you? It can be whatev-fur you'd like!

I’ve shared my life with animals big and small—from breeding and riding horses to caring for a donkey, chickens, cats, and my beloved dog. Each one has been both teacher and healer for me. Their wisdom inspires every session I offer, and I bring that same compassion and respect to your animals as if they were my own.

## Customer Reviews

This was one of the best things I could’ve asked for to communicate with my pet Benji! He was so excited to speak with Cathy and she cleared a lot of his past disturbances. I’m so grateful for our session and to know my dog is happy and he is well cared for! She did a great job answered all my questions and gave me really great advice. Thank you Cathy!

**\- Ellie S**

Cathy has been very sweet and assuring. She even took time over the holidays to connect with my cat and send her on her way home. I am extremely lucky to have my cat back safe, and Cathy was a great help!

**\- Cathy Handford**

A caring, compassionate, kind, and beautiful woman that helped us find a renewed sense of hope and reminded us how important it is to reinforce the foundation before expecting any structures to stand on it.

Great session. She is warm, compassionate, & informative.

**\- Cherise S**

Our session with Cathy was delightful. She took the time to connect with our dog moose. She did some medical healing and connected with him very well. The visit was very confirming for us and we would definitely recommend her to all of our friends. Her service was an absolute pleasure!!! 

**\- Jessica S**

We really loved our experience with Cathy! We had been worried about our dogs recent behavior with the other pups, and she helped us understand his feelings on them, us, and just how he feels in general. An amazing experience that really meant a lot to us!

**\- Jordan R**

Wonderful! She took the time to listen carefully, she did energy healing on me and my pet, and although this was transactional, she did not make it seem like payment or time constraints were a priority. She really took the time to genuinely care about my pet!

Cathy is truly gifted. My dog has less fear. She's more affectionate, her anxiety is better around people and dogs. I'm looking forward to more sessions. I definitely notice progress in my dog.
