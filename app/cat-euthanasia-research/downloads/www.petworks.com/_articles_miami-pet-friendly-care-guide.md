Miami, Florida has earned a reputation as a truly pet-friendly city, thanks in part to the leadership of local officials who champion animal welfare. Mayor Francis Suarez has shown his support by honoring [Miss Peaches, a rescue dog](https://www.axios.com/local/miami/2024/05/22/miss-peaches-barstool-sports-dave-portnoy) who helped raise awareness about pet adoptions. At the county level, Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava, whose office oversees Animal Services, reinforces this commitment through her department’s mission: _“to save the lives of abandoned animals in our care, protect animals from cruelty, reunite lost pets with their owners, protect people and pets in our community from health-related issues, and ensure the public’s safety.”_ Together, their actions highlight Miami’s dedication to both pets and the people who love them.

Miami is famously pet-friendly. A vibrant city where pets, especially dogs, truly feel welcome. Between beaches, parks, restaurants, and transportation, the city offers countless opportunities to enjoy sunny days with your furry companion.
