Hi,  
I am very interested in the Petworks Premium Membership. I will pay monthly and I can begin on July 21st.  
I cannot find the email of the lady who sent me this information. I believe she mentioned a 15% discount, but I’m not 100 percent sure of that.

Hi, Victoria. We will re-email and re-text you about this. If you need more assistance, just ask Hueston Nelson or Kevin Kinyon.
