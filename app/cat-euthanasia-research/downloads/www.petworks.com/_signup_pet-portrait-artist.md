#  Frequently asked questions 

For Pet Pros

  


**What are the paw-sitives of listing with Petworks?**

By joining our pet lovin' community, you get to promote your business and build relationships with pet parents and pet care service professionals who share your love of animals! Most importantly - pet parents will find, book, and pay you on the Petworks platform. Your pet care business will grow!  


  


**How much does it cost to become a member?**

There is no cost to become a member of Petworks. When you are booked by a pet parent through the Petworks platform, we withhold 15% of the proceeds as a booking fee. For example, if a pet parent books you for $200, Petworks keeps $30, and we securely transfer $170 directly into your bank account.  


  


**How does the booking process work?**

Here is a [helpful YouTube video](https://youtu.be/AeCfjVCTtMg) which is a great tutorial explaining the Petworks platform booking process.  


  


**How do pet parents pay me?**

Once you enroll in online payments, pet parents book you online using Visa, Mastercard, American Express, or Discover. Our payments are powered by Stripe.  


  


**Can I join Petworks without using your payment system?**

Unfortunately, you won't be able to list your services with Petworks without enrolling in our payment system.  


  


**When do I get paid?**

When a pet parent books your service and you accept the booking, their credit card is charged. The funds will then automatically be transferred by Stripe to your bank account on file. This generally takes 2-3 business days although the very first payment you receive through Petworks may take a bit longer.  


  


**What if you don't have my category?**

If your unique service is missing from our website, please [shoot us an email](https://www.petmasters.com/user_feedbacks/new) and let us know what you're all about! In the meantime, you can always create a listing under the 'Other Pet Specialities' category. This category holds some of our most unique pet services that may not be as well known or frequently used - but that doesn't make them any less special!   


  


**How do pet parents find Petworks?**

Our pet parents find us primarily through Google and Facebook - though we are ramping up our marketing on Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn as well. With Google, they may do a keyword search and one of our pages comes up or they may notice a paid ad on the right-hand side. Some pet parents view us on other websites that participate in Google's display ad network. On Facebook, people may come across our website as a result of a piece of content that their Facebook friend shared or commented on, or they may see one of our paid ads in their newsfeed.  


  


**What geographic areas does Petworks cover?**

Petworks is a nationwide platform, with pet professionals listed in every state of the U.S. When pet parents want to find a pet pro, they simply choose a category and explore the list of purr-fessionals near them!  


  


**Can I create a listing if I'm not in the U.S.?**

We are currently focused on building up our community of pet pros and pet parents within the United States. For this reason, we're only looking for pet lovers in the United States to join us (for now!)  


  


**Where is Petworks based?**

The Petworks platform is nationwide, but our corporate offices are in Westport, Connecticut.

  


**What if I still have questions?**

If you have additional questions about how things work at Petworks, please [send us a message](/user_feedbacks/new) and someone will get back to you ASAP! If you prefer to chat on the phone, ring us at (203) 450-6597.
