## Customer Reviews

Exceptional support in helping me find my cat - although I havent found her, I am sure with all the insights into her possible location, she will soon return. It was really wonderful interacting with Dina who provided me with constant updates and google maps images. Pray that my adorable cat comes back soon - I am happy that she is with someone but hope she returns.

**\- Sandy N**

Dina’s reading of my 2 doxies was right on the mark. They seemed needy and I wasn’t sure why. Dina understood Daisy & Cooper better than I do and was able to give me so many helpful suggestions. I am so pleased to have written answers to my questions that I can refer back to again & again. The follow up of an hour long phone call to discuss her insights after the readings was invaluable. I have no doubt I will be calling Dina again in the future and I will be recommending her highly to friends and family. If you feel like you need to understand your pet better in this life or to reach out to them once they have crossed over, don’t hesitate to have Dina help. 

**\- Debbie B**

I cannot explain how SPOT ON Dina's reading was for my daughter's precious calico cat Azalea! We adopted her a year ago from a Humane Society, and all we knew is her age, 3 years old. 

I hired Dina to do a reading so we could know why Azalea was abandoned, and what we could do to make her life with my kids more enjoyable. She had been exhibiting signs of anxiety and aggression.

Dina was able to give us action steps to do , which we did immediately, and we saw a remarkable difference in Azalea's disposition. She told us a treat she wanted, a special toy, and some wonderful advice on how to interpret her behavior and ways to feed her.

Dina is not only a pet medium, but also a highly skilled pet behavioralist! I cannot recommend her more highly.

She is also punctual, thorough, and very friendly. This is our first time ever hiring a pet psychic, and it will not be our last!!

**\- Cindy S**

Just wanted to thank Dina again for this wonderful session that we had. She brought a lot of clarity and gave us a peace of mind that our little fur baby is at peace and that she is ALWAYS with us. She had mentioned that our girl was talking about a party that was all for her and how excited she was. Little did she know, we are throwing her a "Celebration of Life" for Kai this upcoming weekend with our friends and family. There was no possible way Dina would've known that so we just thought it was funny that Kai mentioned it to her. Dina was also spot on about our girl's personality too!!! Thanks again Dina! We appreciate you and your gift!

**\- Kiana M**

Dina was absolutely amazing! We have been struggling with our cat over-grooming himself and after doing a reading with Dina we got all the answers we were looking for! I couldn’t say enough great things about this experience. I’m so grateful that I followed my gut and went forward with getting a reading from Dina! 

**\- Brooke G**

I wanted to wait a few days before I wrote this review, only because I wanted to practice some of the things Dina told me to do with my Lilly. This was the best experience and offered so much detailed insight into why my girl has been acting out. it's been a few days now and no more acting out. it's a miracle. im so excited for our future now that I know how to communicate with her. Definitely worth it to work with Dina! and she's so fast! I will definitely be back to check in again down the road. 

**\- Casondra G**

This is my second time contacting Dina. She helped me last year in my decision to help my dog Maeby cross the rainbow bridge. Her words were very reassuring and it was helpful to have someone confirm everything I was feeling.   
I reached out to her a year later when we were considering keeping our new foster dog. Her insight and communication with our foster has been immensely helpful in how we now speak to her, understanding how to care for her and give her exactly what she needs. I will absolutely be working with Dina again in the future. 

**\- Christine S**

We lost our cat Toby recently and as many of you know, it’s beyond stressful and agonizing when your pet is not home, especially when the nights get cold. The best call that I ever made was to Dina . I was extremely skeptical to say the least, I’m so happy I decided to be open minded. Dina was extremely compassionate and spot on as I was searching for him according to the map, the directions and indications that she gave me. They were oddly specific and I was in shock when they correlated with what she was telling me. She was extremely kind and patient and not to mention prompt in communicating and following up   
THANK YOU Dina! You truly have a gift and my family could not thank you enough.!!

**\- Vanessa B**

I want to say a huge thank you to Dina for working with me at such a short notice. She was able to accomplish my needs and was very kind.   
From the moment I asked my 10 desires questions, she let me know when she will respond and went over details.

It started with her telling me how my dog wants to let me know to tell him that it is okay he is no longer young. That I love him for being him and his little old self.

She also told me about how his teeth were hurting and how sometimes it bothers him when he eats but that he cannot wait to see me in his next lifetime. 

I was extremely emotional reading the email and all I did was just cry for my old boy. Time has passed so quick and I truly wish I gave him perhaps a better life but this gave me so much clarity, confirmation and affirmation that he will be okay. 

I cannot imagine a universe where I do not meet with him, that is a constant variable that will never change. 

I truly appreciate Dina for doing this for those that are seeking a bond that has past or current. 

I truly believe souls such as her come here for a strong purpose and to spread as much love and guide others to their next chapter. 

Thank you for everything. 

**\- Izzy C**

Dina was so insightful and really hit the mark at understanding my two cats experiences, she left me speechless! Dina gave me lots of advice and guidance when it comes to keeping harmony in my home. I am going to implement a few changes and I will be coming back for another reading in a few months to get an update! 

**\- Melanie M**

Dina is amazing. She is very kind, and very talented with her gift. If you need answers I highly recommend Dina. 

**\- Queta B**

Dina has great customer service - she is responsive, kind, and collaborative. It is obvious that she cares about animals and enjoys her work. The reading I recieved was very clear and helpful. Thank you!

**\- Ellie B**

I had the most amazing session with Dina, and I can’t recommend her enough! She connected with my dog, Donnie, in a way that was so deeply personal and insightful—it felt like she was translating his thoughts and feelings directly to me. The level of detail she provided, from his favorite activities to his little quirks, was beyond anything I expected.

Her guidance was spot-on, and our follow-up conversation helped clarify even more about what Donnie wants and needs. 

If you’re considering a session with Dina, DO IT! Thank you for giving me such a special gift with my sweet boy!

**\- Liechelle H**

Dina was absolutely amazing! We loved receiving the results from our dog's reading—it was incredibly detailed and specific. Her insights were spot-on, and we truly appreciated her thoughtful approach. We’d definitely book her again!

**\- Camilla P**

Where do I begin?!... I'm not sure exactly how I came across Dina's information here on Petworks, other than a divine intervention. I was researching some of my boy Mega's symptoms after feeling disconnected from out regular vet, worried about his condition and chance of survival. I was very frustrated to say the least, as I was not having much luck with any veterinary professionals. After I found Dina's info, she stayed on my mind for a few days, so i returned to this site. I read the reviews, which truly helped me to solidify my decision to book her. I am hoping that by leaving a review myself, it can assist with another pet lover to open themselves to this beautiful opportunity. With some skepticism, I did move forward with booking Dina. She responded almost immediately to my message and followed up with a phone call within minutes. A few moments after our call, Mega went outside, came right back in, walked directly to his bed, and went straight into a deep stage of sleep. This was not normal for him recently, as his health had severely declined in the last week. He was in such a deep stage of sleep I felt the need to record him, as he had not had good rest in quite some time, and I couldn't believe my eyes. To say that Mega became very calm since having contact with Dina is an understatement. She asked for a few recent photos of Mega and any questions I had for him. Within 12 hours she had already sent over her reading. The information she shared with me was nothing like I'd ever experienced before. There were many things that she had absolutely no way of knowing. Some things even happened a day or two prior to us being in contact with each other. I am also not one to share anything personal on any kind of social media sites, and I do understand that being a thought of doubt. The gift that Dina gave me with the answers and information she provided is indescribable. Unfortunately, it was Megas time to crossover, and thanks to Dina I was able to understand that Mega knew his organs were failing him, he was in pain, and was ready to crossover. The only stipulation he did have, was wanting it to be from home. He was already an anxious pup, and a typical vet visit would stress him out tremendously, so I understood this. With her help I was able to give my baby the best final gift I could have. A chance to finally be at peace, but surrounded by the ones he loved the most. Even though the scheduling of the appointment, and actual crossover was extremely difficult and painful, Dina's gift that she shared with myself and Mega provided me with so much comfort. The best way to describe our final moments together is 'Peaceful' and for that I am forever grateful. Not only did she follow up with a phone call after the reading, but she has continued to reach out, even after his crossover. I cannot express how much more I've received from this experience than I had anticipated. If i had the ability to give her 10 hearts instead of 5, i most certainly would. I urge anyone who is looking to find answers to any circumstances with their pet to reach out to Dina. I promise you, this is something you will never regret. She's an absolutely blessing to any pet & pet parent that is willing to allow her to be a part of your journey. Best wishes to all & your babies. 

**\- Alicia J**

Everything went very smoothly. Dina is so compassionate and empathetic. I feel so much better knowing that my sweet Jax is safe and looking after me. I also feel as though Dina has become a cherished friend. Thank you so much for your help and making me feel at ease about Jax.

**\- Patricia C**

Dina was absolutely fantastic! She gave me some amazing insight into my senior pup to ensure I’m doing the best I can for her! She brought things up that she just wouldn’t be able to know, and I’m truly grateful to have found her! I will definitely rebook for another reading once I make the adjustments to my pups routine to ensure her happiness! Highly recommend!!

**\- Frangelia M**

My dear Boe tragically passed and I’m so devastated.   
I honestly don’t even know how I found this site but I did   
Dina reached out rather quickly connected right away to me and Boe   
Although I feel an immense amount of suffering, and this is all new to me. I am not very articulate normally, although I am educated.   
Dina spoke to me like a friend always patient with me. I spoke to her couple of times and she was always correct about my girl Boe   
I truly became a believer I feel she communicated with Boe and I can now feel Boe ‘s presence and I feel like I gained new understanding and also met a wonderful caring person who has helped me with the healing process   
Thank you so much ⭐️ 

**\- Kathy S**

Dina is incredible. My dog had been lost for almost 3 days and she gave me hope that she was still ok. She mapped out possible locations and provided descriptions of houses and their surroundings to look for in my very rural neighborhood. Much of her "reading" was spot on and quite impressive. I would highly recommend Dina to anyone looking for their lost pet, she's great!

**\- Nina D**

Dina was incredible. She was quick to respond and connect with our blind husky who had been missing for 3 days. Her details were incredibly accurate and within 5 hours of talking to her and following her guidance, we found our blind baby exactly where she directed us. Her ability to hone in on the smells and sounds our dog was having enabled us to better understand her location and surroundings. She literally tracked her to a cattle farm and with her guidance the farmer located her in minutes! My Husband was a full blown skeptic and is now a believer 100%. Thank you Dina for bringing our baby home. She was available to speak or email or text whenever I needed her and the comfort and hope she provided was immeasurable. So I've a pretty open mind for most things, psychics have always been on the "cusp" for me as I've n ever had what I would consider "valid" evidence as most of the things I've witnessed have been based solely on masterful deductive skills taking into account environment, human nature, behavior, and personal tidbits shared with the psychic.   
This is simply not the case here. I believe Dina communicated with my dog all the way from Rhode Island. The details she gave could have come from nowhere else, not Google Maps, and not from anything we shared with her. We live on a farm surrounded by farms and yes, there is a lot you can glean from that regarding the terrain, etc., around us. But it wasn't that. It was the specific details Dina provided that stunned me and made me believe. Our dog is blind, not cataracts or old age, she literally has no eyes, and there is nothing there whatsoever to lend to vision. What Dina described was spot on and based on smells sounds and feel. We found Estrid right where Dina described she'd be; my wife, Bobbie Hill Wolfe can share the details but the gist of it was that she is against a tree or structure, next to a water source, with the smell of cows but no cows close by her or bothering her, close to home. Estrid was found 2 miles away on our neighbor's cattle farm pressed up against a tree next to a pond at the end of a row of hay bales, cows in the distance. I am no longer a skeptic, Dina is legitimate, and now I'm reevaluating my beliefs and am filled with a wonder of what else I've been skeptical about that could possibly be reality. This experience and Dina, have renewed my childhood curiosity and wonder and hope that there is so much more than just the mundane we are all so used to. I'm not saying this is magic, or voodoo, hoodoo, or superpowers, but I will say this; wouldn't it be wonderful if it was? What an amazing gift Dina has, and what an amazing thing she did giving me back my sweetest friend, Estrid. Bless you Dina, bless you forever and always and thank you for what you did for me and my family.

**\- Roberta W**

From the first message in response to my search, Dina made such an impact on me. She was so compassionate, and her communication is top tier... I was never wondering where the process was at or what it entailed. In her reading she communicated with my boy Cal and was able to share things with me that only he and I would have known!! She also was able to give me clarity on alot of things and even help me as far as educating me about spirits and the spiritual realm. On top of that, what really stuck out to me was that she would follow up and send messages if and when Cal was communicating with her! It's so clear she not only is great at her calling as a medium but truly loves animals. Thank you Dina for all your help and for making my grieving/healing process so much easier to understand. 

**\- Caitlin S**

Dina was very helpful. She stayed in very close contact even though time zones were spread out to help find our dog that had escaped almost 5 days prior to reaching out. She called, texted etc any time there was a change. Thank you

**\- Robin M**

Dina was the best! She was so quick, helpful, attentive, and caring. She immediately called to check in and kept in touch during the process of finding my kitty. Her reading allowed us to quickly find our lost kitty within minutes. It was invaluable. She was so comprehensive and solved a stressful situation almost instantly. I would ABSOLUTELY recommend Dina. 

**\- Sequoia F**

Awesome service and very interesting insights!! 

**\- Michael L**

We could not have been happier with Dina. We were having a tough time with our missing cat Max and Dina was comforting, supportive, and very helpful throughout. She was able to provide a detailed overview of what to look for from the red shed, areas she highlighted to look, and the dog that was close by.

For anyone looking for a medium who is supportive and supper collaborative Dina is your person!

**\- Devon M**

Dina was great. She’s definitely someone you want in your corner when you’re in the middle of a lost animal situation. I never found my dog but Dina helped keep me going to find her when I would get discouraged. 

**\- Kylie R**

Dina did a reading for my dog and cat and I had never had a reading done for either of them so it was a new experience for me but Dina made the process so simple and she was incredibly thorough and thoughtful!!! She knew things about them that were so spot on and specific and she gave me really helpful insights into both of them and their needs and how best to communicate with them on my own! She has been super communicative even after the reading and has given me really helpful advice on how to cleanse a negative energy that was attached to us. 

Overall a really insightful experience and she was so helpful and kind the whole way through! Definitely a positive experience with Dina!

**\- Rebecca C**

I’ll start it off with how we came to find Dina our cat Missy who was 16 years old and starting to decline in health had been diagnosed with kidney disease, cardiac disease, and hyperthyroidism. For a while we were treating everything and she seemed to be getting better and then all the sudden one night she went downhill and fast lost her vision and all of her problems seemingly got worse you could tell she wasn’t in pain but just tired and uncomfortable. This is where we found Dina we wanted answers we wanted to make sure we were doing the right thing by putting her to rest. I messaged Dina and within a couple of minutes got a response back asking to send her some pictures and a list of questions we had then give her an hour or two and we would get an email with the results. We got the results and it was crazy our Missy knew we had got them as well cause once Dina was done Missy came straight to us and sat on our laps as we read what we had gotten back from Dina. What we gotten back was truly amazing I seriously cannot express how much relief and at peace we felt after reading what Dina was able to get I will forever be doing this with future pets and cannot recommend if you are having doubts thinking you are crazy throw those to the side and book this life changing experience. Thank you again Dina 

**\- Cameron B**

An awesome experience with Dina. She is so kind, patient and talented. She was super responsive which was appreciated. Highly recommend. 

**\- Kaiana F**

Our kitty Marcelo snuck out of the house one night without us knowing. We were devastated to find him missing the next morning. He is a diabetic and elderly kitty who has been an indoor cat his entire life with little outdoor experience. We didn’t know where to look or if he even survived the night outside. Working with Dina was wonderful. She provided us a starting point with great information that resulted in us finding him in about an hour. Dina provided much needed reassurance and hope that he was indeed still alive and waiting for us to find him. He came home hungry, thirsty and needing an insulin shot, but unharmed. We are very grateful. We highly recommend Dina. ❤️ 

**\- Camille P**

Dina was amazing! She helped answering some burning questions I had for my baby girl, helped me answer some questions she had for me and even helped me hone in on my own abilities. Very communicative and so helpful in the follow up as well. Dina is just a wonderful person 

**\- Elizabeth S**

I would rate Dina 10 hearts if I could! The reading I received was incredible, and she was so perceptive and accurate that she picked up on things that there was no way anyone would know about. It truly brought me to tears, and the clarity, security and comfort I gained from her reading about my beloved soul cat is priceless. Dina is also incredibly compassionate and understanding, and I felt as if I were talking to a good friend on our call although we had just met through this reading. This was my first time working with an animal communicator and obviously was open to it but naturally had some reservations, and I ended up being completely floored in the best way. If you're feeling unsure for any reason, just go ahead and book a reading with her! Thank you again for everything, Dina!

**\- Becky B**

Dina went above and beyond. She reached out with a follow up and gave me simple changes to try for my RiRi. I noticed a big improvement. RiRi's allergies have calmed down and her quirky behaviors have eased up too. I could not be happier with the outcome.

**\- Bernard D**

Dina is just amazing, I can highly recommend her to everyone who need to contact they loved animal. She is always there for you and I can see why my dog loves to stay in touch with her. I am so glad that I found her here! Thank you Dina and Petworks❤️

**\- Angelique M**

I highly recommend Dina, her heart is at the right place. I am sure this is why she could connect with my loving animal. He was very special and not easy to convince to trust others. 

**\- Angelique M**

Dina was amazing and offered more than hope! I found her reading most helpful because she described the area where we discovered our cat. Nobody could have guessed that location because it was far from home and it had topography that living here forever I still didn’t even know existed here. She was spot on with what she saw down to our cat having an injury. She described a woman that our cat was looking at and I got to meet that woman as she had described. It was surreal. I just couldn't believe how spot on Dina had been with what she had sent. She also was kind enough to follow up with her reading. I know she genuinely cared by everything she did for us. Even if something doesn’t make sense, my advice is to look for it. In my case it did exist, and is was where we found our cat. It was also unique enough to narrow down where to look. I’ve never done this before and very skeptical but Dina is the real deal. I would use her services again! I also want to thank her for how she helped. Our family is now back together and I understand Eddie better in the process. Since he has been found my relationship with him has become even closer than before and I adore it.

**\- John B**

The session with Dina gave me much comfort. I feel more connected with my dog’s spirit and energy. She helped me understand signs my dog was giving me and I feel at peace. Thank you Dina.

**\- Stella G**

Highly recommend Dina’s services. She is top tier. Helped me gain closure for my heart dog that suddenly passed away before her time. Dina goes above and beyond call of duty. 

**\- Sarah N**

Dina was absolutely amazing; she is a kind and compassionate healer!

I have been in a grief funk for the last several months due to the passing of my two dogs within two weeks of each other. My feeling of loss was overwhelming, and I needed help.

I am so glad I found Petworks and picked Dina, she was genuine, caring and honest, her readings on my two dogs were spot on and it brought me so much comfort and healing.

I so appreciated her approach, she will answer any questions you have, and she then takes the time to send you the readings via email so you then can take the time to read it and reread it as many times as you need. If that wasn't enough, she follows up with a phone call to address any additional questions.

I highly recommend Dina, connect with her, you will not be disappointed!! 

**\- Karen K**

My elderly kitty, Maonai, is currently at the Emergency Hospital and I had frantically reached out to Dina yesterday to ask if she could do an emergency session and she responded right away. 

She responded within the hour and really helped me to make an informed decision on whether or not my kitty was suitable and needed to undergo surgery. My session with Dina was so warm and gentle, it was exactly the kind of comfort that I needed during this difficult time. I bawled my eyes out reading Dina's session notes. Animal communication is such a wonderful experience, although often can be sad and painful depending on what pet parents are going through. But this process is still worth every tear. 

I highly, highly recommend Dina to anyone who needs reassurance about the wellbeing of their beloved fur baby. Dina's loving, kind and warm energy will help soothe even the most worried pet parent.

I am so grateful for Dina and the light she brings into this world. 

**\- Linda C**

Dina is caring and sensitive to your needs. My situation has become a little complicated in that it seems my missing feline has been taken in by someone in a neighboring community and as of this review there has been no way revealed that will help bring about her return. I'm confident in this assessment in large part because Dina was able to describe a setting in her communications with my Missy Gurl that closely matches the description and mapping I received from Tim Link. I would definitely call in Dina if you are in need of her kind support. 

**\- Randall S**

Dina is so sweet and caring. She has devoted her life to helping animals and their owner/parents. She saw and said things she read from our cat-George, she could not have otherwise known or seen. Really impressed. She got a sense of his personality and needs. And shared messages with me. She starts with answering questions and offering what she gets from your pet via email, then follows up with a phone call to answer any lingering questions. I loved it. And appreciate her gift, left me wondering if she reads people?! ❤️

**\- Brice G**

Truly cannot thank Dina enough! This has brought me so much peace and comfort in such a heartbreaking time. I have really been struggling with the loss of my fur baby and she went above and beyond to connect with him and I will forever be grateful for everything! ♥️

**\- Tara B**

Dina was great and she helped us communicate with our babies. We feel more connected with them! 

**\- Shirley G**

Incredible! Dina was so supportive and was right on with helping me locate my lost cat. I recommend her wholeheartedly and cannot thank her enough!❤️

**\- Patti R**

Dina was my savior for my lost kitty! He had been missing for about 12 hrs and Dina reached out to me right away even late at night. She understood my heart was breaking and became me rock through the entire experience. She went to work right away communicating with my kitty and gave me text updates and email updates throughout his journey. She gave me specific details of his surroundings that helped me search and send energy between us. She gave me hope and an emotional support beyond anything I expected. I am so grateful for her gifts and her persistent efforts to connect and communicate to us both. My kitty came home as she described. He went through an ordeal but is home safe and sound. I hope to have another session with Dina once he's healed up to learn of his journey. Thank you Dina for everything you did for us!

**\- Rebecca K**

My experience with Dina has been a amazing journey. Her concern for your my pet is genuine. She has helped me stay the path and not get discouraged. Her positive attitude in helping me find my pet has been very helpful. To be honest I would have been lost in this endeavor to find Rosie without her. Thank you for everything you do . Experience was all positive. 

**\- Terry p**

If you are looking to connect with a beloved pet who went over the rainbow bridge I highly recommend Dina. Not only is she caring and compassionate providing an ear with tactile items to assist in support prior to connecting with your loved animal she is gifted in truly hearing them. There were so many things she shared that only Maddy and I would know about, super specific things, and it brought peace to my heart. The fact that she wrote down the reading allowed me to digest as needed when thing were overwhelming and I’m able to look back and read again. Not everything was easy to read (what I may want to hear) so I know it was truly my polite little love. Dina also sends messages after the reading if there are still things they want to say. Apparently, Maddy is not a fan of greenies. ‍♀️

I’ve been grieving terribly, feeling like I can’t go on and Dina’s gift in connecting lifted my heart and I can breathe again. The feeling of loss of this magnitude was something I never expected and because of Dina instead of feeling like I’m falling into a pit I now think of the wonderful times and have joy vs despair. I’m grateful for Dina.

**\- Lori L**

Dina responded right away. she has such a great heart and cares. She has given me hope and great details about my baby marley. she is amazing , i recommend her! 

**\- Delaney K**

Dina replied to me right away about our lost cat, Panda. She has given me a lot of helpful insights and information with a clear compassion and caring for both animals and their people. 

**\- Patricia K**

Everything was so amazing. Dina truly is an angel sent from above and she really helped me cope with the loss of my Flower. She gave me insight that I didn’t think was possible. I never have had this type of feeling knowing she will be okay. She is truly a blessing.

**\- Annie D**

Dina was great! Our cat Reggie had been missing for a week and I was at a loss of what to do and wondering if he was even still alive (Reggie is an indoor cat with not so great survival skills). Dina connected with him and gave us info on how he was feeling and what he was seeing around him. She gave us places circled on a map to look for him which was SO helpful. The whole time she was extremely communicative and genuinely concerned. When the circled spots didn’t pan out, she suggested we try the “mirror” of that area (so, for us, the opposite side of the neighborhood). My mom and I went out to that area, doing our usual scent trail and gently calling for Reggie. When we doubled back to go home, there he was! Sitting half hidden next to a tree waiting for us! Dina was such a huge help in finding him bc she kept us motivated, checked in and would follow up with suggestions. If it weren’t for her, we would have completely given up bc we were too depressed and stressed out to keep looking. I told Dina - money well spent! Make no mistake that you have to put in a lot of effort on your own to find your pet, but Dina was the help we desperately needed to get him home. Thank you so much for a positive experience, Dina!

**\- Megan H**

Thank you so much Dina for helping me catch the sweet baby kitten to bring her back to her mom and brother. Both the mom and her 2 kittens are doing amazing now all thanks to your amazing reading and advice. You were so communicative and thoughtful, I could not have asked for anything more! The world needs more people like you 

**\- Sarah D**

I booked a session with Dina for my little guy Jack that unexpectedly passed away while I was out of town. I was heartbroken and had so many questions on what happened. Dina was able to provide so much clarity and was even able to bring up things that only Jack and I knew. It felt like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders knowing he was happy and still around. This was the first day (since he passed) that there was a lightness to it, I was able to move around my day without feeling so heavy and sad knowing that he’s still very much around, happy, and not in pain. Dina was wonderful and answered my questions and the follow up call was so great for any other questions I had from his reading. I feel like I can now enjoy my day and still feel very much connected to my Jack. She even gave some insight on when he’s giving signals of when he’s around and what traditions we had that he’d like me to continue doing. This session has given me so much clarity, connection and relief. I would 100% recommend it! Dina takes time and doesn’t rush anything, and is very personable. I’ll definitely be recommending her to anyone I come across who wants some extra help connecting to their loved pets!

**\- Stephanie D**

Dina was amazing!!!!!! Highly recommend!!!!! I already feel some connection to my dog who passed away. She spent so much time helping me feel some type of peace ☮️ 

**\- Nicolle B**

Dina is an amazing, caring soul that has a strong connection with animals.   
I contacted her when our beloved cockatoo, Peaches had fallen ill. I was looking for answers to her condition. What might be contributing to it, what could help, how she was feeling.   
When I got the reading back I was completely shocked at how spot ok she was with so many things.   
During our follow up call, she spent time with us answering anything unclear and provided many suggestions. It gave us peace to know that our sweet baby wasn’t in grave danger but needed some things tweaked in our household.   
Dina has still kept in contact with us through Peaches journey back to health.   
I cannot express enough how much this has meant to us. Thank you so much for being the healing light you are! 

**\- Lindsay S**

Dina is the real deal and an absolute blessing. It’s been nine months since my kitty went missing. Although I haven’t found him yet, the information I have been given has brought me closer than I have been in a long time and given me more hope than I thought I could have at this point. She knew things there was no possible way she could know and I find myself being more aware of what I’m looking for now thanks to her. I have all the hope and faith in the world I am going to find my sweet kitty sooner than later thanks to Dina. I have already recommended her to a few people that are in a similar situation and I wouldn’t do that if I didn’t truly believe in her and what she is about. ‍⬛

**\- Erin C**

Thank you Dina, I’ve been really lost since my baby passed. She helped give me clarity and I will forever be grateful! 

**\- Lola S**

Dina is amazing! She connected with my dog, Piper, and had such a thorough description of their connection. There were so many aspects confirmed and elaborated on. Overall an amazing experience and cannot recommend Dina enough!

**\- Tessa S**

I have had such a wonderful experience with Dina. She helped me so much and she is a true blessing. I highly recommend her because her soul is connected beyond this physical world. She has a gift. 

**\- Bethany H**

Amazing. 

**\- Bethany H**

Dina is a gift to animals and humanity. I am so grateful for her reading, advice, and support. She went above and beyond to help me, responds quickly, and definitely cares. I will never forget this experience and would honestly recommend her anyone that needs assistance with their animals. I feel very fortunate to have worked with her. 

A million thanks, Dina ❤️ ❤️ ❤️

**\- Alysia K**

I feel she was able to get to know my dog pretty easily. I’m not sure if my dog is convinced to make the changes needed for me to be happy or not as of yet. I will keep trying and see what happens. Update::: my dog has made progress in exactly the way Dina suggested. We gave Gracie her own designated poo area and she went immediately. We still have to remind her but she is making the effort they spoke about. Thanks Dina!

Dina helped me in a time I was really struggling. She was so kind and compassionate. The follow up phone call meant a lot to me and I also learned a lot about my Ono. Highly recommend. 

**\- Allison B**

Going into this I was very skeptical so I gave little to no information about my dog in my initial email to Dina. She came back within 12 hours with an extensive email with all of the details she got from my dog. A lot of the information and insight she had was never shared and only close family would know about. To say the least it made me cry after reading what my dog had to say. It gave me reassurance that he is happy living with me and it gave me a better understanding of how he thinks and feels. I knew he was an anxious pup but to hear it’s because he thinks I will abandon him breaks my heart. To know he understands when I talk to him is amazing and I will definitely be reassuring my love for him more verbally now than before. I will definitely be recommending her to friends and family and may even book another session in the future. Thank you Dina!!

##### Pet Pro's Response:

**\- Dina Gaebel**

Well. Spent a lot of money for the service, to have my address google earthed, described in a “vision”. I received a very general description of a family, which I did find, that had absolutely nothing to do with my missing pet. Save your money. Not with the little bit of hope and huge disappointment. 

**\- Christina S**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

Hi Christina. I'm sorry you didn't find Natty yet. I know we were both hoping she was with that one family. It's really important to look for the details in the reading. There is a couple there that matches the description as well as the surroundings. I was under the impression that we were going to talk again on Saturday but I never heard back from you. I know you are missing her terribly and I am still here for you.

## Customer Reviews

Exceptional support in helping me find my cat - although I havent found her, I am sure with all the insights into her possible location, she will soon return. It was really wonderful interacting with Dina who provided me with constant updates and google maps images. Pray that my adorable cat comes back soon - I am happy that she is with someone but hope she returns.

**\- Sandy N**

Dina’s reading of my 2 doxies was right on the mark. They seemed needy and I wasn’t sure why. Dina understood Daisy & Cooper better than I do and was able to give me so many helpful suggestions. I am so pleased to have written answers to my questions that I can refer back to again & again. The follow up of an hour long phone call to discuss her insights after the readings was invaluable. I have no doubt I will be calling Dina again in the future and I will be recommending her highly to friends and family. If you feel like you need to understand your pet better in this life or to reach out to them once they have crossed over, don’t hesitate to have Dina help. 

**\- Debbie B**

I cannot explain how SPOT ON Dina's reading was for my daughter's precious calico cat Azalea! We adopted her a year ago from a Humane Society, and all we knew is her age, 3 years old. 

I hired Dina to do a reading so we could know why Azalea was abandoned, and what we could do to make her life with my kids more enjoyable. She had been exhibiting signs of anxiety and aggression.

Dina was able to give us action steps to do , which we did immediately, and we saw a remarkable difference in Azalea's disposition. She told us a treat she wanted, a special toy, and some wonderful advice on how to interpret her behavior and ways to feed her.

Dina is not only a pet medium, but also a highly skilled pet behavioralist! I cannot recommend her more highly.

She is also punctual, thorough, and very friendly. This is our first time ever hiring a pet psychic, and it will not be our last!!

**\- Cindy S**

Just wanted to thank Dina again for this wonderful session that we had. She brought a lot of clarity and gave us a peace of mind that our little fur baby is at peace and that she is ALWAYS with us. She had mentioned that our girl was talking about a party that was all for her and how excited she was. Little did she know, we are throwing her a "Celebration of Life" for Kai this upcoming weekend with our friends and family. There was no possible way Dina would've known that so we just thought it was funny that Kai mentioned it to her. Dina was also spot on about our girl's personality too!!! Thanks again Dina! We appreciate you and your gift!

**\- Kiana M**

Dina was absolutely amazing! We have been struggling with our cat over-grooming himself and after doing a reading with Dina we got all the answers we were looking for! I couldn’t say enough great things about this experience. I’m so grateful that I followed my gut and went forward with getting a reading from Dina! 

**\- Brooke G**

I wanted to wait a few days before I wrote this review, only because I wanted to practice some of the things Dina told me to do with my Lilly. This was the best experience and offered so much detailed insight into why my girl has been acting out. it's been a few days now and no more acting out. it's a miracle. im so excited for our future now that I know how to communicate with her. Definitely worth it to work with Dina! and she's so fast! I will definitely be back to check in again down the road. 

**\- Casondra G**

This is my second time contacting Dina. She helped me last year in my decision to help my dog Maeby cross the rainbow bridge. Her words were very reassuring and it was helpful to have someone confirm everything I was feeling.   
I reached out to her a year later when we were considering keeping our new foster dog. Her insight and communication with our foster has been immensely helpful in how we now speak to her, understanding how to care for her and give her exactly what she needs. I will absolutely be working with Dina again in the future. 

**\- Christine S**

We lost our cat Toby recently and as many of you know, it’s beyond stressful and agonizing when your pet is not home, especially when the nights get cold. The best call that I ever made was to Dina . I was extremely skeptical to say the least, I’m so happy I decided to be open minded. Dina was extremely compassionate and spot on as I was searching for him according to the map, the directions and indications that she gave me. They were oddly specific and I was in shock when they correlated with what she was telling me. She was extremely kind and patient and not to mention prompt in communicating and following up   
THANK YOU Dina! You truly have a gift and my family could not thank you enough.!!

**\- Vanessa B**

I want to say a huge thank you to Dina for working with me at such a short notice. She was able to accomplish my needs and was very kind.   
From the moment I asked my 10 desires questions, she let me know when she will respond and went over details.

It started with her telling me how my dog wants to let me know to tell him that it is okay he is no longer young. That I love him for being him and his little old self.

She also told me about how his teeth were hurting and how sometimes it bothers him when he eats but that he cannot wait to see me in his next lifetime. 

I was extremely emotional reading the email and all I did was just cry for my old boy. Time has passed so quick and I truly wish I gave him perhaps a better life but this gave me so much clarity, confirmation and affirmation that he will be okay. 

I cannot imagine a universe where I do not meet with him, that is a constant variable that will never change. 

I truly appreciate Dina for doing this for those that are seeking a bond that has past or current. 

I truly believe souls such as her come here for a strong purpose and to spread as much love and guide others to their next chapter. 

Thank you for everything. 

**\- Izzy C**

Dina was so insightful and really hit the mark at understanding my two cats experiences, she left me speechless! Dina gave me lots of advice and guidance when it comes to keeping harmony in my home. I am going to implement a few changes and I will be coming back for another reading in a few months to get an update! 

**\- Melanie M**

Dina is amazing. She is very kind, and very talented with her gift. If you need answers I highly recommend Dina. 

**\- Queta B**

Dina has great customer service - she is responsive, kind, and collaborative. It is obvious that she cares about animals and enjoys her work. The reading I recieved was very clear and helpful. Thank you!

**\- Ellie B**

I had the most amazing session with Dina, and I can’t recommend her enough! She connected with my dog, Donnie, in a way that was so deeply personal and insightful—it felt like she was translating his thoughts and feelings directly to me. The level of detail she provided, from his favorite activities to his little quirks, was beyond anything I expected.

Her guidance was spot-on, and our follow-up conversation helped clarify even more about what Donnie wants and needs. 

If you’re considering a session with Dina, DO IT! Thank you for giving me such a special gift with my sweet boy!

**\- Liechelle H**

Dina was absolutely amazing! We loved receiving the results from our dog's reading—it was incredibly detailed and specific. Her insights were spot-on, and we truly appreciated her thoughtful approach. We’d definitely book her again!

**\- Camilla P**

Where do I begin?!... I'm not sure exactly how I came across Dina's information here on Petworks, other than a divine intervention. I was researching some of my boy Mega's symptoms after feeling disconnected from out regular vet, worried about his condition and chance of survival. I was very frustrated to say the least, as I was not having much luck with any veterinary professionals. After I found Dina's info, she stayed on my mind for a few days, so i returned to this site. I read the reviews, which truly helped me to solidify my decision to book her. I am hoping that by leaving a review myself, it can assist with another pet lover to open themselves to this beautiful opportunity. With some skepticism, I did move forward with booking Dina. She responded almost immediately to my message and followed up with a phone call within minutes. A few moments after our call, Mega went outside, came right back in, walked directly to his bed, and went straight into a deep stage of sleep. This was not normal for him recently, as his health had severely declined in the last week. He was in such a deep stage of sleep I felt the need to record him, as he had not had good rest in quite some time, and I couldn't believe my eyes. To say that Mega became very calm since having contact with Dina is an understatement. She asked for a few recent photos of Mega and any questions I had for him. Within 12 hours she had already sent over her reading. The information she shared with me was nothing like I'd ever experienced before. There were many things that she had absolutely no way of knowing. Some things even happened a day or two prior to us being in contact with each other. I am also not one to share anything personal on any kind of social media sites, and I do understand that being a thought of doubt. The gift that Dina gave me with the answers and information she provided is indescribable. Unfortunately, it was Megas time to crossover, and thanks to Dina I was able to understand that Mega knew his organs were failing him, he was in pain, and was ready to crossover. The only stipulation he did have, was wanting it to be from home. He was already an anxious pup, and a typical vet visit would stress him out tremendously, so I understood this. With her help I was able to give my baby the best final gift I could have. A chance to finally be at peace, but surrounded by the ones he loved the most. Even though the scheduling of the appointment, and actual crossover was extremely difficult and painful, Dina's gift that she shared with myself and Mega provided me with so much comfort. The best way to describe our final moments together is 'Peaceful' and for that I am forever grateful. Not only did she follow up with a phone call after the reading, but she has continued to reach out, even after his crossover. I cannot express how much more I've received from this experience than I had anticipated. If i had the ability to give her 10 hearts instead of 5, i most certainly would. I urge anyone who is looking to find answers to any circumstances with their pet to reach out to Dina. I promise you, this is something you will never regret. She's an absolutely blessing to any pet & pet parent that is willing to allow her to be a part of your journey. Best wishes to all & your babies. 

**\- Alicia J**

Everything went very smoothly. Dina is so compassionate and empathetic. I feel so much better knowing that my sweet Jax is safe and looking after me. I also feel as though Dina has become a cherished friend. Thank you so much for your help and making me feel at ease about Jax.

**\- Patricia C**

Dina was absolutely fantastic! She gave me some amazing insight into my senior pup to ensure I’m doing the best I can for her! She brought things up that she just wouldn’t be able to know, and I’m truly grateful to have found her! I will definitely rebook for another reading once I make the adjustments to my pups routine to ensure her happiness! Highly recommend!!

**\- Frangelia M**

My dear Boe tragically passed and I’m so devastated.   
I honestly don’t even know how I found this site but I did   
Dina reached out rather quickly connected right away to me and Boe   
Although I feel an immense amount of suffering, and this is all new to me. I am not very articulate normally, although I am educated.   
Dina spoke to me like a friend always patient with me. I spoke to her couple of times and she was always correct about my girl Boe   
I truly became a believer I feel she communicated with Boe and I can now feel Boe ‘s presence and I feel like I gained new understanding and also met a wonderful caring person who has helped me with the healing process   
Thank you so much ⭐️ 

**\- Kathy S**

Dina is incredible. My dog had been lost for almost 3 days and she gave me hope that she was still ok. She mapped out possible locations and provided descriptions of houses and their surroundings to look for in my very rural neighborhood. Much of her "reading" was spot on and quite impressive. I would highly recommend Dina to anyone looking for their lost pet, she's great!

**\- Nina D**

Dina was incredible. She was quick to respond and connect with our blind husky who had been missing for 3 days. Her details were incredibly accurate and within 5 hours of talking to her and following her guidance, we found our blind baby exactly where she directed us. Her ability to hone in on the smells and sounds our dog was having enabled us to better understand her location and surroundings. She literally tracked her to a cattle farm and with her guidance the farmer located her in minutes! My Husband was a full blown skeptic and is now a believer 100%. Thank you Dina for bringing our baby home. She was available to speak or email or text whenever I needed her and the comfort and hope she provided was immeasurable. So I've a pretty open mind for most things, psychics have always been on the "cusp" for me as I've n ever had what I would consider "valid" evidence as most of the things I've witnessed have been based solely on masterful deductive skills taking into account environment, human nature, behavior, and personal tidbits shared with the psychic.   
This is simply not the case here. I believe Dina communicated with my dog all the way from Rhode Island. The details she gave could have come from nowhere else, not Google Maps, and not from anything we shared with her. We live on a farm surrounded by farms and yes, there is a lot you can glean from that regarding the terrain, etc., around us. But it wasn't that. It was the specific details Dina provided that stunned me and made me believe. Our dog is blind, not cataracts or old age, she literally has no eyes, and there is nothing there whatsoever to lend to vision. What Dina described was spot on and based on smells sounds and feel. We found Estrid right where Dina described she'd be; my wife, Bobbie Hill Wolfe can share the details but the gist of it was that she is against a tree or structure, next to a water source, with the smell of cows but no cows close by her or bothering her, close to home. Estrid was found 2 miles away on our neighbor's cattle farm pressed up against a tree next to a pond at the end of a row of hay bales, cows in the distance. I am no longer a skeptic, Dina is legitimate, and now I'm reevaluating my beliefs and am filled with a wonder of what else I've been skeptical about that could possibly be reality. This experience and Dina, have renewed my childhood curiosity and wonder and hope that there is so much more than just the mundane we are all so used to. I'm not saying this is magic, or voodoo, hoodoo, or superpowers, but I will say this; wouldn't it be wonderful if it was? What an amazing gift Dina has, and what an amazing thing she did giving me back my sweetest friend, Estrid. Bless you Dina, bless you forever and always and thank you for what you did for me and my family.

**\- Roberta W**

From the first message in response to my search, Dina made such an impact on me. She was so compassionate, and her communication is top tier... I was never wondering where the process was at or what it entailed. In her reading she communicated with my boy Cal and was able to share things with me that only he and I would have known!! She also was able to give me clarity on alot of things and even help me as far as educating me about spirits and the spiritual realm. On top of that, what really stuck out to me was that she would follow up and send messages if and when Cal was communicating with her! It's so clear she not only is great at her calling as a medium but truly loves animals. Thank you Dina for all your help and for making my grieving/healing process so much easier to understand. 

**\- Caitlin S**

Dina was very helpful. She stayed in very close contact even though time zones were spread out to help find our dog that had escaped almost 5 days prior to reaching out. She called, texted etc any time there was a change. Thank you

**\- Robin M**

Dina was the best! She was so quick, helpful, attentive, and caring. She immediately called to check in and kept in touch during the process of finding my kitty. Her reading allowed us to quickly find our lost kitty within minutes. It was invaluable. She was so comprehensive and solved a stressful situation almost instantly. I would ABSOLUTELY recommend Dina. 

**\- Sequoia F**

Awesome service and very interesting insights!! 

**\- Michael L**

We could not have been happier with Dina. We were having a tough time with our missing cat Max and Dina was comforting, supportive, and very helpful throughout. She was able to provide a detailed overview of what to look for from the red shed, areas she highlighted to look, and the dog that was close by.

For anyone looking for a medium who is supportive and supper collaborative Dina is your person!

**\- Devon M**

Dina was great. She’s definitely someone you want in your corner when you’re in the middle of a lost animal situation. I never found my dog but Dina helped keep me going to find her when I would get discouraged. 

**\- Kylie R**

Dina did a reading for my dog and cat and I had never had a reading done for either of them so it was a new experience for me but Dina made the process so simple and she was incredibly thorough and thoughtful!!! She knew things about them that were so spot on and specific and she gave me really helpful insights into both of them and their needs and how best to communicate with them on my own! She has been super communicative even after the reading and has given me really helpful advice on how to cleanse a negative energy that was attached to us. 

Overall a really insightful experience and she was so helpful and kind the whole way through! Definitely a positive experience with Dina!

**\- Rebecca C**

I’ll start it off with how we came to find Dina our cat Missy who was 16 years old and starting to decline in health had been diagnosed with kidney disease, cardiac disease, and hyperthyroidism. For a while we were treating everything and she seemed to be getting better and then all the sudden one night she went downhill and fast lost her vision and all of her problems seemingly got worse you could tell she wasn’t in pain but just tired and uncomfortable. This is where we found Dina we wanted answers we wanted to make sure we were doing the right thing by putting her to rest. I messaged Dina and within a couple of minutes got a response back asking to send her some pictures and a list of questions we had then give her an hour or two and we would get an email with the results. We got the results and it was crazy our Missy knew we had got them as well cause once Dina was done Missy came straight to us and sat on our laps as we read what we had gotten back from Dina. What we gotten back was truly amazing I seriously cannot express how much relief and at peace we felt after reading what Dina was able to get I will forever be doing this with future pets and cannot recommend if you are having doubts thinking you are crazy throw those to the side and book this life changing experience. Thank you again Dina 

**\- Cameron B**

An awesome experience with Dina. She is so kind, patient and talented. She was super responsive which was appreciated. Highly recommend. 

**\- Kaiana F**

Our kitty Marcelo snuck out of the house one night without us knowing. We were devastated to find him missing the next morning. He is a diabetic and elderly kitty who has been an indoor cat his entire life with little outdoor experience. We didn’t know where to look or if he even survived the night outside. Working with Dina was wonderful. She provided us a starting point with great information that resulted in us finding him in about an hour. Dina provided much needed reassurance and hope that he was indeed still alive and waiting for us to find him. He came home hungry, thirsty and needing an insulin shot, but unharmed. We are very grateful. We highly recommend Dina. ❤️

Dina was amazing! She helped answering some burning questions I had for my baby girl, helped me answer some questions she had for me and even helped me hone in on my own abilities. Very communicative and so helpful in the follow up as well. Dina is just a wonderful person 

**\- Elizabeth S**

I would rate Dina 10 hearts if I could! The reading I received was incredible, and she was so perceptive and accurate that she picked up on things that there was no way anyone would know about. It truly brought me to tears, and the clarity, security and comfort I gained from her reading about my beloved soul cat is priceless. Dina is also incredibly compassionate and understanding, and I felt as if I were talking to a good friend on our call although we had just met through this reading. This was my first time working with an animal communicator and obviously was open to it but naturally had some reservations, and I ended up being completely floored in the best way. If you're feeling unsure for any reason, just go ahead and book a reading with her! Thank you again for everything, Dina!

**\- Becky B**

Dina went above and beyond. She reached out with a follow up and gave me simple changes to try for my RiRi. I noticed a big improvement. RiRi's allergies have calmed down and her quirky behaviors have eased up too. I could not be happier with the outcome.

**\- Bernard D**

Dina is just amazing, I can highly recommend her to everyone who need to contact they loved animal. She is always there for you and I can see why my dog loves to stay in touch with her. I am so glad that I found her here! Thank you Dina and Petworks❤️

**\- Angelique M**

I highly recommend Dina, her heart is at the right place. I am sure this is why she could connect with my loving animal. He was very special and not easy to convince to trust others. 

**\- Angelique M**

Dina was amazing and offered more than hope! I found her reading most helpful because she described the area where we discovered our cat. Nobody could have guessed that location because it was far from home and it had topography that living here forever I still didn’t even know existed here. She was spot on with what she saw down to our cat having an injury. She described a woman that our cat was looking at and I got to meet that woman as she had described. It was surreal. I just couldn't believe how spot on Dina had been with what she had sent. She also was kind enough to follow up with her reading. I know she genuinely cared by everything she did for us. Even if something doesn’t make sense, my advice is to look for it. In my case it did exist, and is was where we found our cat. It was also unique enough to narrow down where to look. I’ve never done this before and very skeptical but Dina is the real deal. I would use her services again! I also want to thank her for how she helped. Our family is now back together and I understand Eddie better in the process. Since he has been found my relationship with him has become even closer than before and I adore it.

**\- John B**

The session with Dina gave me much comfort. I feel more connected with my dog’s spirit and energy. She helped me understand signs my dog was giving me and I feel at peace. Thank you Dina.

**\- Stella G**

Highly recommend Dina’s services. She is top tier. Helped me gain closure for my heart dog that suddenly passed away before her time. Dina goes above and beyond call of duty. 

**\- Sarah N**

Dina was absolutely amazing; she is a kind and compassionate healer!

I have been in a grief funk for the last several months due to the passing of my two dogs within two weeks of each other. My feeling of loss was overwhelming, and I needed help.

I am so glad I found Petworks and picked Dina, she was genuine, caring and honest, her readings on my two dogs were spot on and it brought me so much comfort and healing.

I so appreciated her approach, she will answer any questions you have, and she then takes the time to send you the readings via email so you then can take the time to read it and reread it as many times as you need. If that wasn't enough, she follows up with a phone call to address any additional questions.

I highly recommend Dina, connect with her, you will not be disappointed!! 

**\- Karen K**

My elderly kitty, Maonai, is currently at the Emergency Hospital and I had frantically reached out to Dina yesterday to ask if she could do an emergency session and she responded right away. 

She responded within the hour and really helped me to make an informed decision on whether or not my kitty was suitable and needed to undergo surgery. My session with Dina was so warm and gentle, it was exactly the kind of comfort that I needed during this difficult time. I bawled my eyes out reading Dina's session notes. Animal communication is such a wonderful experience, although often can be sad and painful depending on what pet parents are going through. But this process is still worth every tear. 

I highly, highly recommend Dina to anyone who needs reassurance about the wellbeing of their beloved fur baby. Dina's loving, kind and warm energy will help soothe even the most worried pet parent.

I am so grateful for Dina and the light she brings into this world. 

**\- Linda C**

Dina is caring and sensitive to your needs. My situation has become a little complicated in that it seems my missing feline has been taken in by someone in a neighboring community and as of this review there has been no way revealed that will help bring about her return. I'm confident in this assessment in large part because Dina was able to describe a setting in her communications with my Missy Gurl that closely matches the description and mapping I received from Tim Link. I would definitely call in Dina if you are in need of her kind support. 

**\- Randall S**

Dina is so sweet and caring. She has devoted her life to helping animals and their owner/parents. She saw and said things she read from our cat-George, she could not have otherwise known or seen. Really impressed. She got a sense of his personality and needs. And shared messages with me. She starts with answering questions and offering what she gets from your pet via email, then follows up with a phone call to answer any lingering questions. I loved it. And appreciate her gift, left me wondering if she reads people?! ❤️

**\- Brice G**

Truly cannot thank Dina enough! This has brought me so much peace and comfort in such a heartbreaking time. I have really been struggling with the loss of my fur baby and she went above and beyond to connect with him and I will forever be grateful for everything! ♥️

**\- Tara B**

Dina was great and she helped us communicate with our babies. We feel more connected with them! 

**\- Shirley G**

Incredible! Dina was so supportive and was right on with helping me locate my lost cat. I recommend her wholeheartedly and cannot thank her enough!❤️

**\- Patti R**

Dina was my savior for my lost kitty! He had been missing for about 12 hrs and Dina reached out to me right away even late at night. She understood my heart was breaking and became me rock through the entire experience. She went to work right away communicating with my kitty and gave me text updates and email updates throughout his journey. She gave me specific details of his surroundings that helped me search and send energy between us. She gave me hope and an emotional support beyond anything I expected. I am so grateful for her gifts and her persistent efforts to connect and communicate to us both. My kitty came home as she described. He went through an ordeal but is home safe and sound. I hope to have another session with Dina once he's healed up to learn of his journey. Thank you Dina for everything you did for us!

**\- Rebecca K**

My experience with Dina has been a amazing journey. Her concern for your my pet is genuine. She has helped me stay the path and not get discouraged. Her positive attitude in helping me find my pet has been very helpful. To be honest I would have been lost in this endeavor to find Rosie without her. Thank you for everything you do . Experience was all positive. 

**\- Terry p**

If you are looking to connect with a beloved pet who went over the rainbow bridge I highly recommend Dina. Not only is she caring and compassionate providing an ear with tactile items to assist in support prior to connecting with your loved animal she is gifted in truly hearing them. There were so many things she shared that only Maddy and I would know about, super specific things, and it brought peace to my heart. The fact that she wrote down the reading allowed me to digest as needed when thing were overwhelming and I’m able to look back and read again. Not everything was easy to read (what I may want to hear) so I know it was truly my polite little love. Dina also sends messages after the reading if there are still things they want to say. Apparently, Maddy is not a fan of greenies. ‍♀️

I’ve been grieving terribly, feeling like I can’t go on and Dina’s gift in connecting lifted my heart and I can breathe again. The feeling of loss of this magnitude was something I never expected and because of Dina instead of feeling like I’m falling into a pit I now think of the wonderful times and have joy vs despair. I’m grateful for Dina.

**\- Lori L**

Dina responded right away. she has such a great heart and cares. She has given me hope and great details about my baby marley. she is amazing , i recommend her! 

**\- Delaney K**

Dina replied to me right away about our lost cat, Panda. She has given me a lot of helpful insights and information with a clear compassion and caring for both animals and their people. 

**\- Patricia K**

Everything was so amazing. Dina truly is an angel sent from above and she really helped me cope with the loss of my Flower. She gave me insight that I didn’t think was possible. I never have had this type of feeling knowing she will be okay. She is truly a blessing.

**\- Annie D**

Dina was great! Our cat Reggie had been missing for a week and I was at a loss of what to do and wondering if he was even still alive (Reggie is an indoor cat with not so great survival skills). Dina connected with him and gave us info on how he was feeling and what he was seeing around him. She gave us places circled on a map to look for him which was SO helpful. The whole time she was extremely communicative and genuinely concerned. When the circled spots didn’t pan out, she suggested we try the “mirror” of that area (so, for us, the opposite side of the neighborhood). My mom and I went out to that area, doing our usual scent trail and gently calling for Reggie. When we doubled back to go home, there he was! Sitting half hidden next to a tree waiting for us! Dina was such a huge help in finding him bc she kept us motivated, checked in and would follow up with suggestions. If it weren’t for her, we would have completely given up bc we were too depressed and stressed out to keep looking. I told Dina - money well spent! Make no mistake that you have to put in a lot of effort on your own to find your pet, but Dina was the help we desperately needed to get him home. Thank you so much for a positive experience, Dina!

**\- Megan H**

Thank you so much Dina for helping me catch the sweet baby kitten to bring her back to her mom and brother. Both the mom and her 2 kittens are doing amazing now all thanks to your amazing reading and advice. You were so communicative and thoughtful, I could not have asked for anything more! The world needs more people like you 

**\- Sarah D**

I booked a session with Dina for my little guy Jack that unexpectedly passed away while I was out of town. I was heartbroken and had so many questions on what happened. Dina was able to provide so much clarity and was even able to bring up things that only Jack and I knew. It felt like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders knowing he was happy and still around. This was the first day (since he passed) that there was a lightness to it, I was able to move around my day without feeling so heavy and sad knowing that he’s still very much around, happy, and not in pain. Dina was wonderful and answered my questions and the follow up call was so great for any other questions I had from his reading. I feel like I can now enjoy my day and still feel very much connected to my Jack. She even gave some insight on when he’s giving signals of when he’s around and what traditions we had that he’d like me to continue doing. This session has given me so much clarity, connection and relief. I would 100% recommend it! Dina takes time and doesn’t rush anything, and is very personable. I’ll definitely be recommending her to anyone I come across who wants some extra help connecting to their loved pets!

**\- Stephanie D**

Dina was amazing!!!!!! Highly recommend!!!!! I already feel some connection to my dog who passed away. She spent so much time helping me feel some type of peace ☮️ 

**\- Nicolle B**

Dina is an amazing, caring soul that has a strong connection with animals.   
I contacted her when our beloved cockatoo, Peaches had fallen ill. I was looking for answers to her condition. What might be contributing to it, what could help, how she was feeling.   
When I got the reading back I was completely shocked at how spot ok she was with so many things.   
During our follow up call, she spent time with us answering anything unclear and provided many suggestions. It gave us peace to know that our sweet baby wasn’t in grave danger but needed some things tweaked in our household.   
Dina has still kept in contact with us through Peaches journey back to health.   
I cannot express enough how much this has meant to us. Thank you so much for being the healing light you are! 

**\- Lindsay S**

Dina is the real deal and an absolute blessing. It’s been nine months since my kitty went missing. Although I haven’t found him yet, the information I have been given has brought me closer than I have been in a long time and given me more hope than I thought I could have at this point. She knew things there was no possible way she could know and I find myself being more aware of what I’m looking for now thanks to her. I have all the hope and faith in the world I am going to find my sweet kitty sooner than later thanks to Dina. I have already recommended her to a few people that are in a similar situation and I wouldn’t do that if I didn’t truly believe in her and what she is about. ‍⬛

**\- Erin C**

Thank you Dina, I’ve been really lost since my baby passed. She helped give me clarity and I will forever be grateful! 

**\- Lola S**

Dina is amazing! She connected with my dog, Piper, and had such a thorough description of their connection. There were so many aspects confirmed and elaborated on. Overall an amazing experience and cannot recommend Dina enough!

**\- Tessa S**

I have had such a wonderful experience with Dina. She helped me so much and she is a true blessing. I highly recommend her because her soul is connected beyond this physical world. She has a gift. 

**\- Bethany H**

Amazing. 

**\- Bethany H**

Dina is a gift to animals and humanity. I am so grateful for her reading, advice, and support. She went above and beyond to help me, responds quickly, and definitely cares. I will never forget this experience and would honestly recommend her anyone that needs assistance with their animals. I feel very fortunate to have worked with her. 

A million thanks, Dina ❤️ ❤️ ❤️

**\- Alysia K**

I feel she was able to get to know my dog pretty easily. I’m not sure if my dog is convinced to make the changes needed for me to be happy or not as of yet. I will keep trying and see what happens. Update::: my dog has made progress in exactly the way Dina suggested. We gave Gracie her own designated poo area and she went immediately. We still have to remind her but she is making the effort they spoke about. Thanks Dina!

Dina helped me in a time I was really struggling. She was so kind and compassionate. The follow up phone call meant a lot to me and I also learned a lot about my Ono. Highly recommend. 

**\- Allison B**

Going into this I was very skeptical so I gave little to no information about my dog in my initial email to Dina. She came back within 12 hours with an extensive email with all of the details she got from my dog. A lot of the information and insight she had was never shared and only close family would know about. To say the least it made me cry after reading what my dog had to say. It gave me reassurance that he is happy living with me and it gave me a better understanding of how he thinks and feels. I knew he was an anxious pup but to hear it’s because he thinks I will abandon him breaks my heart. To know he understands when I talk to him is amazing and I will definitely be reassuring my love for him more verbally now than before. I will definitely be recommending her to friends and family and may even book another session in the future. Thank you Dina!!

**\- Dina Gaebel**

Well. Spent a lot of money for the service, to have my address google earthed, described in a “vision”. I received a very general description of a family, which I did find, that had absolutely nothing to do with my missing pet. Save your money. Not with the little bit of hope and huge disappointment. 

**\- Christina S**

##### Pet Pro Response:

Hi Christina. I'm sorry you didn't find Natty yet. I know we were both hoping she was with that one family. It's really important to look for the details in the reading. There is a couple there that matches the description as well as the surroundings. I was under the impression that we were going to talk again on Saturday but I never heard back from you. I know you are missing her terribly and I am still here for you.
