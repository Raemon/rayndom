# What Is The Safest Way To Travel Internationally With A Pet?

Let’s discuss airpets international. Flying with your pets internationally is a significant undertaking that requires thorough preparation, understanding of regulations, and a commitment to ensuring your pet’s safety and comfort. For pet parents planning an international trip, it’s essential to be informed about the steps involved, potential challenges, and resources available to streamline the process. This guide covers everything you need to know before traveling abroad with dogs and cats, highlighting the invaluable assistance provided by Petworks’ [USDA](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/pet-travel)-registered [international pet shippers](https://www.petworks.com/hire/international-pet-shipping).

### Understanding International Pet Travel Regulations

The first step in planning international travel with your pet is understanding the destination country’s pet import regulations. These rules vary widely by country and may include:

  * **Vaccination Requirements:** Most countries require pets to be vaccinated against rabies, often within a specific timeframe before travel. Some nations may also require additional vaccines.
  * **Health Certificates:** A health certificate issued by a licensed veterinarian is typically required. This document confirms your pet is healthy and fit for travel.
  * **Microchipping:** Many countries mandate that pets be microchipped with an ISO-compliant chip for identification purposes.
  * **Quarantine Rules:** Some destinations enforce quarantine periods ranging from a few days to several weeks. It’s important to research this beforehand.



Failing to meet these requirements can lead to delays, fines, or even refusal of entry for your pet. Working with an expert who understands these regulations, such as Petworks’ international pet shippers, can alleviate the stress and ensure compliance.

### Choosing the Right Travel Carrier

Selecting an appropriate travel carrier is critical for your pet’s safety and comfort during the journey. The carrier should meet airline and International Air Transport Association (IATA) standards, which typically include:

  * **Adequate Size:** Your pet should be able to stand, turn around, and lie down comfortably in the carrier.
  * **Ventilation:** Ensure the carrier has sufficient ventilation for airflow.
  * **Secure Fastenings:** The carrier must be securely fastened to prevent accidental openings.
  * **Absorbent Materials:** Place absorbent bedding inside to keep your pet dry during the trip.



If your pet is not accustomed to being in a carrier, start the acclimation process weeks before the journey to reduce anxiety.

### Preparing for the Flight

Before the travel date, there are several steps you can take to ensure your pet is ready for the flight:

  * **Visit the Veterinarian:** Schedule a vet check-up to confirm your pet’s health status and obtain necessary vaccinations and certificates.
  * **Hydration and Feeding:** Avoid feeding your pet a heavy meal right before the flight to prevent discomfort. Ensure they are well-hydrated but not overly full.
  * **Exercise:** Allow your pet to exercise before heading to the airport to help them relax.
  * **Comfort Items:** Place familiar items, such as a favorite blanket or toy, in the carrier to provide a sense of security.



### Booking Flights for Pets

Not all airlines have the same policies for pet travel, so it’s essential to research and choose an airline that prioritizes pet safety. Some airlines allow small pets to travel in the cabin, while others require pets to be transported in the cargo hold.

Key considerations when booking flights include:

  * **Non-Stop Flights:** Opt for direct flights to minimize stress and reduce the risk of mishandling during transfers.
  * **Climate Control:** Ensure the airline offers climate-controlled cargo holds for pets traveling as cargo.
  * **Advance Booking:** Reserve your pet’s spot well in advance, as airlines often have limited space for pet travelers.



### Understanding the Role of International Pet Shippers

Navigating international pet travel logistics can be overwhelming, especially for first-time travelers. Professional international pet shippers, such as those available on Petworks, offer invaluable support to pet parents. These USDA-registered experts specialize in:

  * **Document Preparation:** Ensuring all required paperwork, including health certificates and import permits, is complete and accurate.

  * **Decompression Time:** Allow your pet time to relax and recover from the journey.
