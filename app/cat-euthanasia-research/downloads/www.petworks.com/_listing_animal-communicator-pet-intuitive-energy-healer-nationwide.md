# Animal Communicator - Pet Intuitive Energy Healer - Nationwide

Verified Member since Sep 2019 

Hello, I’m Jessica, your go-to angel channeler and intuitive energy healer with a passion for connecting with pets! Since 2019, I have dedicated my career to helping pet parents understand their furry friends through a unique blend of spiritual development coaching and energy healing. I am certified in various areas, including behavior issues, grief and bereavement, and even communicating with deceased pets. Whether you have a dog, cat, bird, or any other small animal, I can provide insights into their emotions and experiences, facilitating a deeper bond between you and your beloved companion.

In my personalized sessions, I channel your pet's energy using their name and picture, allowing me to translate their messages in a way that resonates with you. I understand that pets can face various challenges, from health issues and trauma to significant life transitions. My empathetic approach not only brings peace of mind but also supports emotional healing during difficult times. I offer both in-person and online sessions, catering to your needs, whether you're near or far. My commitment to providing flexible services ensures that you can always reach out when you need guidance the most.

I serve a wide range of animals and am happy to travel within a reasonable radius to meet your needs. My goal is to create a welcoming environment where you can feel secure in expressing your concerns and questions. Ready to get started? Book through Petworks today and let’s embark on this transformative journey together!
