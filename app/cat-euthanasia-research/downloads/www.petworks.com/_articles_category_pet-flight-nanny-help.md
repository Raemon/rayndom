Pet Flight Nanny

A [flight nanny](https://www.petworks.com/hire/flight-nanny) is a professional caregiver who specializes in safely transporting dogs and cats, typically on commercial airlines. The concept of a “flight nanny” originated from the need to safely transport pets. Particularly small animals, on flights where owners might be unable to accompany them. The idea evolved as pet ownership grew, and people began to travel more frequently, sometimes requiring their pets to join them. Initially, pet transportation was handled by cargo services. But concerns over the safety and comfort of pets led to the development of more specialized services.

Flight nannies are typically experienced animal handlers who accompany pets on flights, ensuring their safety, comfort, and well-being throughout the journey. These professionals often work for specialized pet transport companies or offer their services independently. They prioritize the animals’ well-being during the entire journey, attending to their needs with care, comfort, and attention, including feeding, hydration, and bathroom breaks.

Flight nannies manage all aspects of travel logistics, from coordinating with airlines to handling travel crates and navigating airport procedures. Their main objective is to ensure dogs and cats reach their owners safely and without stress. This provides pet parents with peace of mind through high-quality care.

# The Rise of The Flight Nanny

Pets are increasingly considered beloved members of the family. As such, when it comes to relocating or traveling long distances, pet parents face the challenge of ensuring their furry companions are transported safely and comfortably. This is where the role of a flight nanny comes into play.

### **What are Flight Nannies?**

A flight nanny, also called a pet escort or pet travel concierge, is hired to accompany pets during air travel. The concept of flight nannies isn’t new. However, their services have grown more popular in recent years. This rise is due to the increasing demand for safe and stress-free pet transportation. Flight nannies are responsible for ensuring that pets reach their destination safely, comfortably, and in compliance with airline regulations. They offer a range of services tailored to the specific needs of both the pets and their owners, including pre-flight preparations, in-flight care, and assistance with [customs and quarantine procedures](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/pet-travel).

### **How is a Flight Nanny Involved with the Transportation of Pets?**

The involvement of a pet flight nanny begins well before the actual travel date. They work closely with pet owners to coordinate travel logistics, including booking flights, obtaining necessary documentation, and arranging pet accommodations at both departure and arrival destinations. Additionally, flight nannies provide valuable guidance on pet travel requirements, such as crate size specifications and vaccination records.

### **Safe and Secure**

Flight nannies secure pets in their travel crates and accompany them to the airport on the day of travel. They handle all check-in procedures, including paperwork and security screenings, to ensure a smooth departure process. During the flight, flight nannies provide constant care and attention to the pets, ensuring they remain calm and comfortable throughout the journey. Upon arrival at the destination, flight nannies oversee the retrieval of pets from the aircraft and assist with any necessary customs or quarantine procedures. They then accompany the pets to their final destination, whether it be a new home, a boarding facility, or a temporary accommodation.

Pet owners can feel at ease knowing their animals are in capable hands.
