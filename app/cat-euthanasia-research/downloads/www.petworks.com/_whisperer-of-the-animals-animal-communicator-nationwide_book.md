### [Whisperer of the Animals - Animal Communicator - Nationwide](/en/listing/506413) by [Teri Ann Tate](/en/user/wota)

Animal Energy Practitioner-Initial Session & bonus session

$189 Per Animal 

This package is for the Animal Energy Practitioner Initial Session. Teri Ann will be working remotely with your animal that includes their Physical; Emotional; Mental; and Spiritual levels of your animal. 

Your animal may need adjusting in one area or all of them. There is no set time limit on the initial session, as she makes sure nothing is left out.

After her initial session, Teri Ann will contact the owner to relay what she has found out about what is going on with the Animal, as well as making suggestions and guidance for the owner to proceed to the next step.

Bonus 1: written report

Bonus 2: free 2nd reading, 7 days after the initial session & report has been given to owner, to see if anything is new or perhaps still lingering. 

There is a form to be filled out on her website, before the initial session can begin:
