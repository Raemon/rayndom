**AMA**

**What should I look for in a professional in-home pet sitter, and should they have prior experience?**

Look for a sitter who has experience caring for the type of pet you have and is comfortable handling their specific needs. They should be reliable, communicative, and have positive references or reviews. Many experienced New York City NY pet sitters also have basic knowledge of pet health and behavior, which is especially helpful in case of emergencies or special care requirements.

**Should I ask if the pet sitter is insured, bonded, or background-checked?**

Yes. Always ask if the pet sitter carries liability insurance and has been background-checked, especially since they’ll be in your home. Bonding offers added protection in case of theft or property damage. Professional sitters often provide this information upfront and may even be part of established pet care networks or platforms that require these verifications.

**Does Petworks have local pet sitters available throughout Manhattan?**

Yes! Financial District, Battery Park, Tribeca, Chinatown, Little Italy, SoHo, East Village, West Village, Civic Center, Midtown Manhattan, Times Square, Theater District, Hell’s Kitchen, Garment District, Midtown East, Midtown West, Upper Manhattan, Upper West Side, Upper East Side, Harlem, Morningside Heights, Washington Heights, Inwood, Marble Hill, Central Manhattan: Central Park area, and Carnegie Hill. 

**How can I make sure my NYC pet sitter will follow my pet’s routine and meet their emotional needs while I’m away?**

A quality in-home pet sitter should ask for detailed instructions about your pet’s feeding schedule, medication, exercise, and comfort routines. Before hiring, schedule a meet-and-greet to observe how the sitter interacts with your pet. A good in home pet sitter in New York City will also provide daily updates, photos, or videos to reassure you that your pet is safe, happy, and well cared for.

**What are average New York City Pet Sitting Rates in 2026?**

Many NYC pet sitters price shorter visits (like drop‑ins or quick check‑ins) around $18 to $30 per visit. Overnight rates often range from about $75 to $120+ per night in New York City. 

**Best Dog Park in New York City**

Central Park is a dog-friendly oasis in the heart of New York City, perfect for walks, play, and exercise with your furry friend. Dogs must be on a leash in most areas, but there are several off-leash dog runs where pets can safely socialize and play. With wide paths, open fields, and plenty of green space, Central Park offers a refreshing escape for both dogs and their owners to enjoy the outdoors together.
