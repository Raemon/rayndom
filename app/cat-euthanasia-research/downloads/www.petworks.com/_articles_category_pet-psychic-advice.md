Pet Psychic Advice

To book a remote session with a [pet psychic](https://www.petworks.com/hire/pet-psychic), a pet parent first visits the intuitive’s Petworks listing page. Then a pet parent chooses a convenient date and time for the remote session. During the session, the pet psychic establishes a telepathic connection with the pet, often aided by a photo or description provided by the parent. The psychic then uses her intuitive abilities to communicate with animals and understand their emotions, behaviors, and needs. Through this connection, the psychic offers insights into the pet’s feelings, health issues, or past experiences. And also provides guidance on training, behavior modification, and improving the pet’s overall well-being.

Psychics talk to animals using telepathy. They imply animals are like humans in their ability to think and feel deeply. Research shows animals can feel basic emotions like joy, anger, and grief. Neuroscientists believe a primitive brain area generates these emotions in all mammals. Following a remote session, the pet parent receives recommendations or action plans based on the psychic’s insights to strengthen their bond with their furry companion.

A typical remote session with a pet psychic usually ranges from $75 to $250, depending on the psychic’s experience, reputation, and session length. Some psychics charge by the hour, while others offer flat rates for specific services such as communicating with a lost pet, understanding behavioral issues, or connecting with a deceased animal. Shorter consultations may be more affordable, typically starting at around $50 for a 15-minute session. It’s common for pet psychics to offer phone, video, or email readings, with some also providing package deals for multiple sessions.
