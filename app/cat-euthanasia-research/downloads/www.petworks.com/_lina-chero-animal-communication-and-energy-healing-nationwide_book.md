ANIMAL COMMUNICATION & EFT Emotional Freedom Technique and more

$130 Per Hour 

Would you like to create a more harmonious, healing environment for your animal and yourself? This one hour session is the perfect start. 

If you're seeking a holistic approach to address emotional or behavioral challenges in your animal companion, my one hour session is ideal for both you and your animal companion who can benefit from a combination of Animal Communication and EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique).   
This powerful session is especially beneficial for cases involving:

Trauma: Whether your animal has experienced past trauma.

Fears & Anxieties: Addressing deep-rooted fears, from separation anxiety in animals to stress and worry in humans, helps create a sense of peace and safety.

Behavioral Issues: Animal behavior challenges such as aggression, excessive barking, or shyness can often be linked to underlying emotional causes. EFT and Animal Communication can uncover and release these triggers, leading to a more balanced, well-behaved companion.

This session is via Zoom or we can arrange another video form or phone if you prefer.
