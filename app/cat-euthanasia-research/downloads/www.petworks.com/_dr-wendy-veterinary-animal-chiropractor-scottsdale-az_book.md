### [Dr. Wendy - Veterinary Animal Chiropractor - Scottsdale, AZ](/en/listing/508542) by [Wendi Weiss](/en/user/drwendy70)

Muscular Release and Adjustment

$159 Per 45 Minutes 

Manipulations of an Animal’s spine is best when releasing the tight muscles that surround the area in order for the adjustment to hold. Muscular Imbalances lead to the muscles twisting and pulling the spine out of place which will impinge the associated nerve. This can lead to lameness or pain with your Pet. When the muscles are released they are able to relax creating more range of motion, less pain and the relief they need. I like to focus on the applied kinesiology aspect & acupuncture meridians with animals. It is common for animals to have muscular knots inhibiting their activity levels. By releasing these stubborn muscles, it will lead to a better quality of life for your animal.
