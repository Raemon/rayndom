Donna Carlson - Certified Grief & Pet Loss Coach | PhD Student in Intuitive Interspecies Communication | Soul & Tail Collective

Helping Hearts Heal — One Soul Connection at a Time

too quiet. too empty. too much space.   
Losing a beloved animal changes everything—the sounds, the rhythm, the way your heart beats.

You don’t have to learn the new rhythm alone.

Hi, I’m Donna Carlson, a Certified Grief and Pet Loss Coach and Animal Communicator with a lifelong passion for helping people and animals heal together. Through my work with Soul & Tail Collective, I offer compassionate, heart-centered guidance for anyone grieving the loss of a beloved animal or struggling with emotional pain surrounding their pet’s journey — whether they are here or on the other side.

My Services

Pet Loss Coaching   
Gentle, nonjudgmental support to help you process grief, honor your companion, and find peace after loss. Each session provides space for tears, stories, and healing energy as we explore ways to stay connected through love, not pain.

Animal Communication (Intuitive Readings)   
I tune into your animal’s energy — whether living or in spirit — to share messages, emotions, and insights that foster understanding and healing. These sessions often bring comfort, closure, and renewed trust in your bond.

Grief Support for All Losses   
While my focus is on pet loss, I also hold sacred space for those walking through human loss, life transitions, and the search for renewed purpose after grief.

My Approach

I blend intuitive communication, Gestalt coaching principles, and spiritual awareness to help you heal emotionally and energetically. Our time together is safe, compassionate, and deeply personal — designed to support your healing at the pace your heart is ready for. Whether through a private session, a healing circle, or a memorial experience, I guide you in finding comfort, connection, and peace again.

Session Options

Private Pet Loss Coaching – 45 minutes: $40

To book a session, simply send me a message with details about your pet and the support you're seeking. I’ll get back to you as soon as possible. Or choose a pricing package and click "Book Now". 

What Clients Say

“Donna’s compassion and insight helped me move through the most painful time of my life. Her connection with my dog was undeniable. I felt peace for the first time since saying goodbye.”

From Grief to Joy   
“When I met Donna, I was feeling hopeless with grief. After six months of healing, I’m hopeful with joy.   
I learned to let myself feel the difficult emotions I’d been hiding from and to face them with the healing strength of the herd. Once I could do that, I began to move through my grief.   
I opened my broken heart one more time to receive the healing Donna offered—and I’m so glad I did.   
I am forever grateful for this life-transforming experience.”   
— Christine, PA

“Donna changed my life with this beautiful healing experience—it’s like nothing you’ve ever done before.   
She helps you heal yourself, and she does it with compassion and empathy like no one else.   
Simply magical. I highly recommend!”   
— Alix K., PA

### Distinction

## Customer Reviews

Donna has been such a critical part of our grief journey over the past week after losing our pup. We felt lost and like we would never escape the awful grief we were experiencing days after our loss. Donna has given us tools and exercises that has helped us express gratitude for the time we spent with our soul dog and to honor him. I don't know where we'd be without Donna's coaching, we're forever grateful for her patience and caring!
