### [ Lost Pet Location Protocol™ — Nationwide & Worldwide - Nationwide](/en/listing/508975) by [Lindsey Latham](/en/user/lindseylatham)

Lost Pet Location Protocol™ Core Report

$280 Per Animal 

Message me first to see if we are a good fit to work together.   
This is perfect for you if you are wanting information regarding a lost pet. Upon purchase, I require a photo of your pet and then I type out a report of the impressions I receive through mediumship and reiki animal communication. Delivery of your report within 24-48 hours, first come first serve. Please do not provide ANY information besides the photo of your pet. Doing so may jeopardize the clearness of the information I am given through psychic means. If I need more information, I will ask you directly. Doing so allows me to receive clear communication from your pet & my spirit team to then translate the information to you. All services with me are held in the highest spiritual integrity with all that is. Always for the good and healing of all beings involved. Rooted in truth and authenticity.   
After receiving your pet's photos ( looking into the camera if possible) I connect and communicate with your baby while taking notes and requesting specific information about location, well-being, and what happened. I also relay that you are searching for them and that you love them so much. After this step, I send you my notes to keep everything in spiritual integrity. I then request the address they went missing from to start piecing things together. I provide screenshots of Google Maps of possible locations and actionable suggestions that may have not been thought of previously.   
Please feel free to message me with any questions or concerns.
