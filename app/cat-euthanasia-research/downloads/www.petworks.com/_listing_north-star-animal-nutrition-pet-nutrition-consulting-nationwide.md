(19 reviews)

Verified Member since Aug 2023 

North Star Animal Nutrition is an independent animal nutrition company servicing equine, canine and feline clients. I believe that your pets nutrition should be as unique as your pet. With a masters in animal nutrition and over 10 years of experience helping owners do the best by their animals I understand the struggles of making sure your pets are as healthy as possible in a confusing market. Together we will discuss the nutritional challenges your pet faces and your goals for their health. We will then come up with a cost effective solution to make sure your pet is feeling their best. I will provide a balanced diet or feeding plan, which meets the standards of AAFCO or NRC, and provide you with a full nutritional analysis and recipe if a home-cooked diet is decided upon. I am excited to speak with you and learn more about your pets needs. Please contact and book me on Petworks. Thank you.

**\- Wendy O**

Jessica was a great help with my cat, who is a complicated case. He has food allergy/intolerances as well as hyperthyroidism. Jessica helped us navigate what foods to try both for iodine content and for allergy symptoms. She left us with several options and our first option is working well. I emailed her multiple times about how the foods were affecting my cat and she had great feedback and suggestions. She really helped. 

**\- Kris A**

My appointment went very well. Jessica was fantastic! She was very thorough - she requested our pup’s medical records prior to our consulation because our pup has a liver condition. In speaking with her, I felt she had completely reviewed the records. She listened to our fears and concerns with a home made diet and explained everything to us in an easy to understand way. I had researched home made dogfood recipes before finding Jessica and found it to be overwhelming. Jessica really helped with that. I can’t tell you how excited and confident we are to begin this journey. 

**\- Lisa Z**

My consultation was very helpful and all my questions were answered, we're going to work together to find a diet that will work for my dog.
