**PAA**

**How do I know when it's time to euthanize my pet at home?**

Pet parents often struggle with this heartbreaking decision. A veterinarian can help assess your pet's quality of life based on signs such as chronic pain, inability to eat or drink, labored breathing, or loss of mobility. In-home euthanasia allows your pet to pass peacefully in a familiar, comforting environment surrounded by loved ones. If you're in Utah, consider reaching out to a mobile veterinarian who specializes in this compassionate service to guide you through the process.

**How much does in-home pet euthanasia typically cost?**

The cost of in-home pet euthanasia can vary depending on location, the size of your pet, and whether additional services like aftercare or cremation are included. On average, prices range from $250 to $600. In Utah, many mobile veterinarians offer upfront pricing and options to suit different budgets, so it’s important to ask what’s included when scheduling the service.
