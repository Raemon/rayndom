#  privacy 

This privacy policy discloses the privacy practices for [https://www.petworks.com](https://www.petworks.com/). This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by this Website. It explains the following:

  * What personally identifiable information is collected from you through our Website, how we use it and with whom it may be shared.
  * What choices are available to you regarding the use of your data, including the ability to have us delete your personally identifiable information; and
  * The security procedures in place to protect the misuse of your information.



## INFORMATION COLLECTION, USE, AND SHARING

We are the sole owners of the information collected on our Website. We only have access to, and will only collect, information that you voluntarily give us through the Website, via email or in other direct communications with you. We will not sell or rent the information, which we collect on the Website, to anyone.

We will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you contacted us. We will not share your information with any third party outside of our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request or administer our services.

To keep our users informed and engaged, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about specials, new products or services, or changes to this privacy policy unless you ask us not to by “opting out” of these communications as described in “Your Access to and Control Over Information.”

## GOOGLE APIs

Petworks use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes), including the Limited Use requirements.  


  


## YOUR ACCESS TO AND CONTROL OVER INFORMATION

You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time by emailing us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). You may also do any of the following, at any time, by emailing us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection):

  * See what data we have about you, if any.
  * Change/correct any data we have about you.
  * Have us delete any data we have about you.
  * Express any concern you have about our use of your data.



## SECURITY

We take precautions to secure information you provide to us via the Website. 

Whenever we collect personally identifiable information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page.

We also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The locations in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.

## REGISTRATION

In order to use the Website, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to provide certain information (such as their name and email address). This information is used to contact you about the products/services on our site in which you have expressed interest. At your option, you may also provide demographic information (such as gender or age) about yourself, but it is not required.

Additionally, if you would like to provide services through our Website as a pet pro, then you will need to create a pet pro account, which you can do by [clicking here](https://www.petworks.com/signup).

## ORDERS

We may request specific information from you on our order form. For example, to book services through Petworks, you may be required to provide relevant contact information (_e.g.,_ name and address) and payment information which is used for billing purposes and to fill your order. If we have trouble processing an order, we'll use the contact information you provided to contact you.

## COOKIES

We use "cookies" on our Website. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a site visitor's hard drive to help us improve your access to our Website and identify repeat visitors to our Website. For instance, when we use a cookie to identify you, you would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our Website. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Website. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information on our Website.

## SHARING

We use a credit card processing company to bill users [pet parents and pet pros] for goods and services. Under our agreements with these processing companies they are not permitted to retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes beyond processing your payment.

## LINKS

This Website contains links to other sites. Although we may provide links to other websites as a possible resource to you, we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such other sites, and you should review the privacy policies, terms and other information of any such other sites to understand how those other sites operate and might use your information.

## SURVEYS & CONTESTS

From time-to-time our Website requests information via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you may choose whether or not to participate and therefore disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will only be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of our Website.
