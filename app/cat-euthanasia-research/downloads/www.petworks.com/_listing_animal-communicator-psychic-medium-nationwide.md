# Animal Communicator - Psychic Medium - Nationwide

(50 reviews)

Verified Member since May 2020 

I am very fortunate to be able to connect with any animal energy, both living and passed, to communicate their thoughts, feelings and emotions. My intention is to create improved circumstances and facilitate healing for animals and their owners. I have helped many pet owners in the heartbreaking work of lost pet recovery. I work consistently throughout the United States and can perform sessions both in person and virtually. Session fee is $150 (virtual appointments) and are approximately 45-60 minutes. In-person sessions will incur a travel fee. All gratuities go to an animal charity.

I am also a psychic medium. I can connect with any energy that has passed. It is my honor to do this work, in all forms. 

Thank you for your interest and God bless.

## Customer Reviews

You were so wonderful and accurate   
Thank you so much. You made a difference 

**\- Kathy S**

She's quick to respond to messages. However, I had to cancel because I do not have a picture of the pet I want to communicate with. 

**\- Joni K**

I met Jennifer for an in person animal communication (for an animal that had passed). She was very warm, welcoming, and very kind. She provided evidence that she was communicating with my pet specifically, so I was assured she was speaking with him. She knew details about his life that only I would have known. This gave me overall closure and comfort during a very sad and difficult time. Jennifer was very soothing and allowed for plenty of time to ask/answer questions. She has a very strong passion for her work. I would highly recommend her medium and psychic services. 

**\- Brynne F**

It was amazing! 

**\- Addison C**

My reading with Jennifer was absolutely everything I was hoping to hear from our beloved sweet girl, she provided me with comfort from the very start of our conversation, she was very compassionate and made us feel comfortable. I would definitely recommend if you are looking to connect with your pet on a personal level. 

**\- Amanda**

Absolute pleasure. Very fun reading, even during the darkest of times, for my little family. Jennifer is a direct line to those you’ve lost and or are still with. She has the gift and you won’t be disappointed! 

**\- Elissa P**

So very kind and personal and help ease our pain by connecting with our pup. Thank you Jennifer. 

**\- Tayler E**

Jennifer was very informative and helpful. She told me what my dog wanted from me and what was bothering him...it helped me in understanding my dog

**\- Bobbie S**

It was a great experience - good communication with Jen . The reading itself was so awesome - it left me feeling great and more understanding of my 2 pets. 

**\- Barbara P**

this was more than i could have asked for! appreciated every second of it will definitely be back. such a positive experience 

**\- Kaitlin S**

Jennifer was amazing and helped me so much with my cats passing! I’m looking forward to using her again in the near future. 

**\- Molly C**

Very helpful and practical, with really specific information and transparency about the process.

**\- Sarah C**

Jennifer was great and super helpful in my search for my missing pet. She is honest and up front with all her notes. 

**\- Melody B**

My session with Jennifer was wonderful and otherworldly. Her intuitive insights made complete sense, and truly resonated with my particular experience, and it felt great to have insight into my conversation with my dear cat Moon, whom I trust will find his way home, and I'm feeling so grateful to realize I can also consciously connect him with him, as I feel him closer. Really with such an uplifting energy Jennifer brings live the spiritual communication. Very thankful for her professional service and sharing her divine gifts and refined attunement.

**\- Eva M**

We had a wonderful session with Jennifer! Highly recommend working with her. It was so special to connect to our dog in a new way.

**\- Josephine W**

Loved it! The entire process was very healing and all my questions were answered. Highly recommend!

**\- McKayla H**

Jennifer is wonderful . I highly recommend if you are in search of answers. 

**\- Queta B**

Jennifer is spot on and willing to ansewr any questions. Super friendly.   
I have used her twice now!

**\- Brittany K**

Jennifer is amazing! Helped me answer some questions that I had for my dog Graham. I will defiantly be scheduling more readings with her! 

**\- Ashley F**

The best experience I have ever had!   
Jennifer is the best and made me and my husband feel so comfortable from the beginning, and we felt even more connected to our little prince, Loki after our session!   
Everything resonated, there is not enough positive things I can say about Jennifer and this experience! I immediately recommended Jennifer to my Sister in Law, and I would 100% do this again! 

**\- Angelica (Angie) L**

Jennifer was amazing. She definitely brought more insight to our new kitty. Jennifer’s energy was very calm and trusting. Looking forward to connecting with her as our kitty progresses. 

**\- Karen S**

Once a skeptic, now a regular that's hungry for more sessions.

I booked a session with Jennifer for my girlfriends birthday so she could communicate more clearly with one of our current animals — to be honest, I was very skeptic, and resigned that if nothing else, it would be a fun birthday present.

I cannot emphasize enough how quickly we will be booking additional sessions. Jenn's energy is incredible, warm, accepting, and delightful. She spoke so fluidly and comfortably not just with us, but on behalf of our little girl. I'm beyond excited to continue to do this with all of our animals, and I can't thank Jennifer enough for her time, her work, her ability, and her kindness. Whether you believe in this or not, this was the best form of therapy, the greatest way to allay your concerns, affirm your suspicions and anxieties, and was genuinely the greatest gift we could have. Thank you Jenn. 

If you're on the fence, don't be. It's worth it.

**\- Marshall M**

We had a great and moving experience with Jennifer!

**\- Tammy R**

Everything went well. Jennifer was professional, but also warm & caring. I'm sure that my cat was as comfortable with her as I was. 

**\- Sandy S**

just as amazing as the first session 

**\- Kaitlin S**

My experience with Jennifer was positive. She promptly responded to my request for assistance in finding my lost cat. She was able to psychically connect with her to find out her physical and mental condition, whether she was hungry, and pinpoint her approximate location. Jennifer is the real deal. The information she gave me was accurate. I highly recommend her.

**\- Catherine B**

It was the best thing ever. Thank you Jennifer.

**\- Yuko C**

Jennifer is wonderful. She is educated, friendly, and extremely competent.   
She has a great energy about her that instantly calmed my dog granting her trust to perform the massage. 

Jennifer teaches you massage skills and is available for follow up phone calls/video chats if you have any questions.

She is full of resources! 

My 14yr old 28lb Australian cattle dog has been struggling with and over-working his hind legs when he’s fallen on the floor and struggling to get up.   
This really helped loosen him up! 

Thank you Jennifer!

**\- Devon M**

Absolutely amazing. The day of the meeting i got a call from someone who seen my cat. It was where she said she was. I did not trap Mika. But I have hope and I am not giving up! I highly recommend Jennifer.

**\- Richard E**

Jennifer was easy to work with. In my conversation with my pet, she mentioned a few things that reassured me that only pet would have known.

**\- Gloria F**

Meeting with Jennifer was helped by her connecting with my cat.

**\- Geneen N**

Jennifer sent me great energy. I had that feeling that I would find my dog. She guided me to the right location. Very glad that I reached out and contacted Jennifer.

**\- Carol L**

Jennifer was a fantastic communicator, ensuring that I had a clear understanding of what to anticipate during the session. Throughout our time together, she exhibited nothing but kindness and warmth. I appreciate the opportunity to connect with soulpup under her guidance.

**\- Stephanie O**

My session with Jennifer was really interesting and informative. I had certain things going on that I was concerned about. I left with clarity and direction which has enabled me to take better care of my pup! I would absolutely recommend her to a friend. 

**\- Holly J**

Jen did an excellent job.

**\- Robert S**

Jenn was amazing: so gracious and wise. Her kindness and her love for the work she does truly shines through. 

**\- Esther L**

Decided to cancel. Sorry.

**\- Aleasha K**

Thank you so much for the guidance and care in successfully helping us find our fur baby! You were spot on! You kindness and care will forever be in our hearts! I cannot thank you enough!!

**\- Michelle S**

Wow, just wow. Jennifer was amazing, I love her energy so much. I reached out to her because my cat was having a lot of anxiety issues and I wanted to know what was going on and how to help. She told me that there’s a non-malicious spirit in my house that was causing my cat great distress. I already knew about the spirit so any doubts I may have had about long-distance readings were instantly shattered. What I didn’t know was that it was bothering my poor fur baby. As I was talking to her about it and telling her that I would take care of it my cat, Doc, hopped up next to me on the couch and gave me all of the head butts, which is how he normally shows his affection, as if he was thanking me because now I finally knew what was wrong and could help him. So thank you so much Jennifer for helping us connect. If you have anything you need to talk to your pets about, book with Jennifer!

**\- Chelsea L**

Jennifer was wonderful. I was nervous at first, but her gentle, kind demeanor put me at ease. The information felt spot on and I now feel validated that I am making the best choices for my sweet little dog. Thanks again, Jennifer ♥️

**\- Nicole F**

Great reading with tons of empathy and she connected with my lost kitty boy. He was found near structural buildings that she highlighted in her reading and he was healthy and ready to come home from his adventures!

**\- Licinda P**

Thank you Jennifer for your insight and truthful readings from my baby BW that passed. It truly gave me some peace and better understanding. It's an experience I will never forget. Your sweet soul and empathy was felt during feedback on my connection with my son that passed. As well as spot on readings from my baby.... Thank you jenn!!

**\- Keith A**

Jennifer was very intuitive and informative. She gave us information and locations we would have never searched. She cares and is truly compassionate. Not only for our pet but also, our well being. Most importantly she gave us hope for the possibility that we reunite with our sweet cat Willie again.

**\- Karen T**

We had a great session with Jennifer! We learned a lot about our cat. Jennifer was very professional and communicative, and overall a lovely lady. Thank you Jennifer!

**\- Avery K**

Jennifer was great. She was able to get the answers I needed from my cat. I appreciated her style and approach to the end of life questions I had for my cat. Would definitely recommend her if you are a struggling pet owner wrestling with the decision of when to part with your ill pet.

**\- Jeff G**

Jen is a godsend. Her "talk" with my dog Scotty as he approaches the end of his life due to kidney failure gave me some peace of mind and hope that Scotty and I will be reunited in the future.

**\- Paul E**

Jen was phenomenal! She brought things up that there’s no way she could have known. It really helped answer some questions that have really been weighing on me. I’m so grateful to have had this experience with her! 

**\- Melissa K**

I contacted Jennifer to help me find Ella, my dog who went missing. Using her crystal, Jennifer did a map dowsing and sent me a screen grab of the map with Ella's approx location indicated.   
About an hour later, a neighbor called me. She spotted Ella in that same location.   
Amazing!

**\- Dan V**

reading doesnt seem to resonate with the reality but Jennifer seems to be very experienced. would have appreciated more guidance beyond a reading but i do understand she's busy

**\- Carrot W**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

I’m sorry that you felt our session did not resonate with you. I did my best to help you locate your dog. I do not find it appropriate that you repeatedly texted me afterwards, asking me (amongst other things) to analyze your dream about your dog, or to “just sense if she’s near me” while I was working with other clients, without booking a secondary appointment. I also don’t find it appropriate that you gave me a 2/5 review after I was unable to give you a same-day appointment. I did offer to help you again at my next available opportunity. I hope that you and your dog are reunited, I sincerely do, and that one of the other five communicators that you’ve worked with will eventually be able to make that happen for you. Stay blessed. 

**\- Jennifer Luciana**

She didn’t connect at all. There was nothing about my dog that she knew but she was very nice about everything. 

**\- Teresa S**

Most importantly she gave us hope for the possibility that we reunite with our sweet cat Willie again.

We had a great session with Jennifer! We learned a lot about our cat. Jennifer was very professional and communicative, and overall a lovely lady. Thank you Jennifer!

**\- Avery K**

Jennifer was great. She was able to get the answers I needed from my cat. I appreciated her style and approach to the end of life questions I had for my cat. Would definitely recommend her if you are a struggling pet owner wrestling with the decision of when to part with your ill pet.

Jen is a godsend. Her "talk" with my dog Scotty as he approaches the end of his life due to kidney failure gave me some peace of mind and hope that Scotty and I will be reunited in the future.

Jen was phenomenal! She brought things up that there’s no way she could have known. It really helped answer some questions that have really been weighing on me. I’m so grateful to have had this experience with her!

I contacted Jennifer to help me find Ella, my dog who went missing. Using her crystal, Jennifer did a map dowsing and sent me a screen grab of the map with Ella's approx location indicated.   
About an hour later, a neighbor called me. She spotted Ella in that same location.   
Amazing!

reading doesnt seem to resonate with the reality but Jennifer seems to be very experienced. would have appreciated more guidance beyond a reading but i do understand she's busy

##### Pet Pro Response:

I’m sorry that you felt our session did not resonate with you. I did my best to help you locate your dog. I do not find it appropriate that you repeatedly texted me afterwards, asking me (amongst other things) to analyze your dream about your dog, or to “just sense if she’s near me” while I was working with other clients, without booking a secondary appointment. I also don’t find it appropriate that you gave me a 2/5 review after I was unable to give you a same-day appointment. I did offer to help you again at my next available opportunity. I hope that you and your dog are reunited, I sincerely do, and that one of the other five communicators that you’ve worked with will eventually be able to make that happen for you. Stay blessed.

She didn’t connect at all. There was nothing about my dog that she knew but she was very nice about everything.
