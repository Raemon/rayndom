# Chiro4Critters Animal Chiropractic Services - Incline Village, NV

Member since Oct 2025 

Animal Chiropractic Services for Dogs, Cats, Rabbits.

I’m Dr. Amanda Kremer, a certified Animal Chiropractor now seeing pets right in Incline Village, NV.

I’ve been helping animals move and feel their best for nearly two decades — working with dogs, cats, and rabbits. Chiropractic care can help pets with stiffness, arthritis, mobility issues, post-injury recovery, and general wellness.

I recently relocated my practice, Chiro4Critters Animal Chiropractic, from Washington and I’m so excited to now be part of the Tahoe community. ❤️

If your dog or cat is slowing down, limping, or struggling to jump up like they used to, I’d be happy to talk about whether chiropractic care might help.
