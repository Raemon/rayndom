#### How did you hone your craft?

Dr. Laura Halsey grew up in San Diego and was inspired to become a veterinarian as a way to combine her love of animals and science with her passion for wanting to create positive change. After graduating UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine in 2010 she returned to San Diego to complete a rigorous internship in emergency and specialty medicine. Dr. Halsey proceeded to general practice in order to not just focus on pets during their time of need, but also for preventative and follow up care. During these years it became apparent that traditional medicine was not always enough to help her patients, especially in their senior years. Dr. Halsey became trained and certified in veterinary acupuncture and incorporated this into her general practice. Over her years of practice, Dr. Halsey has built a team of like minded professionals. The goal of Whole Life Veterinary Care is to bring these unique skill sets into the comfort of your own home.

#### What tip would you give pet parents for working with animals that you've learned as a pro?

We believe in positive reinforcement and working to reduce stress in conjunction with improving health. 

#### What is one thing you want pet parents to know about you? It can be whatev-fur you'd like!

Drop the lobby drama and the carrier car ride - bring the vet to you!
