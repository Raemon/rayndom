# Certified Professional Canine Nutritionist - Nationwide

Verified Member since May 2024 

My name is Lisa Mayer, and I am a Certified Professional Canine Nutritionist and Certified Holistic Pet Health Coach. I am the owner of KK’s Paws for Wellness, LLC, where I specialize in individualized nutritional support for dogs with chronic health concerns, digestive issues, kidney or liver challenges, inflammatory conditions, and more.

My approach is rooted in holistic, species-appropriate nutrition with a focus on fresh, anti-inflammatory, whole-food-based diets. I believe in helping pets thrive naturally by supporting the body’s innate ability to heal through proper nutrition, lifestyle adjustments, and targeted supplement strategies.

I offer 1:1 consultations to create customized, gently-cooked or raw meal plans, natural support protocols, and actionable guidance to empower pet parents on their dog’s wellness journey. Every plan is tailored to the unique needs of the pet — because no two dogs are the same.

If you're ready to take a proactive, holistic approach to your dog's health, I'd be honored to work with you.
