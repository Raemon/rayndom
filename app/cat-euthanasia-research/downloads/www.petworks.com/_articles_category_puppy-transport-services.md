# Do Lhasa Apso Puppies Grow Into Good Family Pets?

Lhasa Apso Puppies. Adopting a Lhasa Apso puppy can be a rewarding experience, bringing a loyal and affectionate companion into your home. This ancient breed, originating from Tibet, displays a distinctive appearance and an endearing personality. Potential adopters should learn about adoption and rescue costs across the United States, transportation expenses, wellness needs such as nutrition, grooming, and veterinary care, and the breed’s history and suitability as a family pet.

### **Adoption and Rescue Costs Across the United States**

The cost of adopting a Lhasa Apso can vary significantly depending on the source…whether through a breeder, rescue organization, or animal shelter. Purchasing a Lhasa Apso puppy from a reputable breeder typically ranges from $600 to $1,500, though prices can vary widely based on factors like lineage and location.

Adoption fees from rescue organizations or shelters are generally more affordable and often cover initial veterinary care, vaccinations, and spaying or neutering. For instance, [Niagara Dog Rescue](https://www.niagaradogrescue.com/) lists their adoption fees as follows:

  * Dogs under 1 year: $850
  * Dogs aged 1 to under 8 years: $695
  * Seniors (8+ years): $450
  * Special needs dogs: $450



It’s important to note that these fees can vary based on the organization’s policies and the dog’s age, health status, and other factors.

“Lhasa Apso puppies can grow into excellent family companions when they’re properly socialized and trained early. They’re loyal, intelligent dogs that thrive in homes where their independent nature is understood and respected.” – p _araphrased from guidance by[Dr. Marty Becker, DVM](https://www.drmartybecker.com/), veterinarian and pet behavior expert._

### **Transportation Costs**

If you’re adopting a Lhasa Apso from a distant location, transportation costs should be considered. These expenses can vary widely based on distance, mode of transport, and the organization’s arrangements. For example, [Charming Pet Rescue](https://www.charmingpetrescue.org/) charges a transport fee of $300 for dogs, which is paid at checkout when choosing transport as the delivery method. You can book a [puppy transportation](https://www.petworks.com/hire/puppy-transportation) pro yourself as well.

In some cases, rescue organizations collaborate with volunteer pilots or non-profit groups to transport animals, potentially reducing costs. Organizations like Pilots To The Rescue aim to prevent at-risk animals from being euthanized by transporting them via air and ground transportation to give them the best chance at adoption. It’s advisable to discuss transportation arrangements and associated costs with the adoption agency during the adoption process.

### **Overall Wellness: Nutrition, Grooming, and Veterinary Care**

Ensuring the health and well-being of your Lhasa Apso involves attention to nutrition, grooming, and regular veterinary care.

### **__Nutrition** :

A balanced diet is important for the health of a Lhasa Apso. High-quality commercial dog food that meets the nutritional standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) is recommended. Portion control is essential to prevent obesity, a common issue in small breeds. Consulting with a veterinarian can help determine the appropriate diet and portion sizes based on your dog’s age, weight, and activity level.

### **Grooming:**

Lhasa Apsos possess a dense, straight, and heavy coat requiring consistent maintenance. To prevent matting and ensure coat health, regular grooming is crucial. While a full, flowing coat is traditional, many owners prefer a shorter “puppy cut” (approximately 1-2 inches) for easier upkeep. Brush the coat frequently (ideally several times a week) and schedule periodic professional grooming. Perform routine hygiene tasks as well, including nail trimming, ear cleaning, and dental care.

### **Veterinary Care:**

Consistent veterinary check-ups are essential for maintaining the health of your Lhasa Apso. Although generally healthy, the breed is predisposed to conditions such as hip dysplasia, patellar luxation, and various eye disorders. Early detection through regular veterinary visits allows for more effective management of potential health issues. Routine veterinary care should encompass vaccinations, parasite prevention, and dental hygiene.

### **Breed History**

The Lhasa Apso is an ancient breed from Tibet, dating back over a thousand years. Named after the holy city of Lhasa, these dogs were bred by Buddhist monks to act as sentinels for temples and monasteries. Their keen hearing and alert nature made them excellent watchdogs, alerting monks to any intruders who managed to get past the outdoor guard dogs, often Tibetan Mastiffs.

The breed’s name, loosely translated, means “bearded lion dog,” reflecting their appearance and esteemed status in Tibetan culture.

### **Fun Facts About Lhasa Apso Puppies**

  * **Royal Gifts** : The 14th Dalai Lama introduced the breed to the United States in the late 1940s by gifting Lhasa Apsos to visitors, spreading their popularity beyond Tibet.




### **Lhasa Apsos as Family Pets**

**Lhasa Apsos and Children:**

  * Early socialization with children is crucial for Lhasa Apsos. This helps prevent potential aggression.
  * While well-socialized Lhasa Apsos generally do well with children, adult supervision is always recommended to ensure the safety of both the child and the dog.
