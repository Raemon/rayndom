# Dr. Marty Goldstein of Petworks

In the pantheon of pet health and nutrition, few names resonate as profoundly as Dr. Marty Goldstein. An acclaimed veterinarian and pioneer in holistic pet care, Dr. Marty has dedicated his life to transforming the health and well-being of pets through innovative nutritional practices. His journey is a testament to the power of integrative medicine and the profound impact that diet can have on the vitality and longevity of our beloved animal companions.

## **Early Life and Education**

Dr. Marty Goldstein’s path to becoming a renowned pet nutritionist and holistic veterinarian was influenced by his early fascination with animals and medicine. At an early age, Dr. Marty exhibited a keen interest in biology and natural sciences from a young age. This passion led him to pursue a veterinary degree from [Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine](https://www.vet.cornell.edu/), where he graduated in 1973. Despite receiving a conventional veterinary education, Dr. Marty was always intrigued by alternative healing methods and the potential of nutrition to prevent and treat diseases.

## **A Paradigm Shift in Veterinary Medicine**

Early in his career, Dr. Marty encountered a professional and personal turning point when his own health deteriorated. Diagnosed with severe arthritis and facing a bleak prognosis, he sought alternatives to traditional medicine. His journey into holistic health and nutrition for his own ailments ignited a profound shift in his veterinary practice. Realizing the interconnectedness of diet, health, and disease, Dr. Marty began to explore holistic and integrative approaches for his animal patients.

## **Founding Smith Ridge Veterinary Center**

In 1984, Dr. Marty Goldstein co-founded the Smith Ridge Veterinary Center in South Salem, New York. The center became a beacon for holistic veterinary care, blending conventional medicine with alternative therapies such as acupuncture, chiropractic care, and nutritional therapy. Dr. Marty and his team focused on treating the root causes of illnesses rather than merely addressing symptoms. This integrative approach often involved customized nutritional plans, which became a cornerstone of his practice.

## **Joining Petworks As Lead Pet Nutrition Advisor**

In 2021, Dr. Marty joined the pet care platform Petworks as an advisor in its [Animal Nutrition](https://www.petworks.com/hire/animal-nutritionist) care division. Dr. Marty’s pet nutrition expertise and guidance helped Petworks evolve and become the preeminent animal and pet nutrition consultation service for pet parents, that it is today. 

## **The Power of Pet Nutrition**

Dr. Marty’s holistic philosophy is underpinned by a simple yet profound belief: nutrition is the foundation of health. He has long advocated for species-appropriate diets, emphasizing the importance of natural, raw, and minimally processed foods for pets. In his view, many commercial pet foods are laden with artificial ingredients, preservatives, and fillers that can contribute to chronic diseases and diminished vitality.

One of Dr. Marty’s significant contributions to pet nutrition is his work on formulating high-quality, biologically appropriate pet foods. His product line, [Dr. Marty Pets](https://drmartypets.com/), features freeze-dried raw dog and cat foods, treats, and supplements that are designed to provide optimal nutrition. These products are crafted with a deep understanding of the dietary needs of dogs and cats, drawing on Dr. Marty’s extensive experience and knowledge.

## **Overcoming Skepticism and Challenges**

Dr. Marty Goldstein’s holistic approach initially met with skepticism and resistance from some quarters of the veterinary community. The conventional veterinary field, heavily influenced by pharmaceutical and commercial pet food industries, often viewed alternative treatments with suspicion. However, the undeniable success stories of Dr. Marty’s patients gradually began to change perceptions.

Pet parents found new hope in Dr. Marty’s integrative treatments after conventional veterinarians gave their animals grim prognoses. By incorporating nutritional therapy and holistic treatments, pets with chronic conditions such as cancer, arthritis, allergies, and autoimmune diseases often showed remarkable improvements. These success stories fueled a growing acceptance and appreciation of holistic veterinary medicine through innovative [pet nutrition](https://www.petworks.com/hire/pet-nutritionist),
