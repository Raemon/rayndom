It’s a real investment in your pet’s health, safety, and long-term happiness. [(more…)](https://www.petworks.com/articles/professional-pet-care-for-wellness/#more-17170)

# The Benefits of EFT Tapping

EFT Tapping (Emotional Freedom Technique) was created by Gary Craig in the 90s. It’s also known as ‘tapping’, because you actually tap on acupressure points. Which according to the TCM Traditional Chinese Medicine, are specific points on the body. Meridians that influence the flow of energy in the body called Qi (pronounced “chee”) or vital energy.

These points are connected to your organs and your organs are connected with your emotions. Which in turns signifies a strong connection between stagnant emotions or stagnant energy. This disrupts the flow of Qi (vital energy) and created imbalances in specific organs associated with those emotions. This then leads to potential health issues. For example, the liver is associated with anger, the lungs with sadness and grief, the kidneys with fear, the spleen with worry, the heart with joy or lack of joy (depression, agitation, anxiety).

### **EFT Tapping**

The [process of EFT](https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.emotional-freedom-technique-eft.acl9225) involves tapping on the points connected to your main organs and releasing the stagnant emotions. This, as you tap through them. And you will increase your wellness the more you practice this powerful technique in yourself and your animal companions. Each point you’re tapping on represents that major organ holding those emotions and as you tap the emotions are released. Here is a list of the emotions being released as you tap:

  * Anger
  * Frustration
  * Sadness
  * Feeling unworthy
  * Fear
  * Anxiety
  * Grief Worry
  * Shyness



Up to this point I’ve talked about what EFT can do for you and based on my experience with many clients, humans and animals…and I dare say that the results are just as amazing in animals as they are for us. This simple, yet powerful technique, will leave you and your animal companion with a sense of calmness, relief, joy, peacefulness that you may not have experienced in a long time and that your animal will adapt to very quickly. EFT is often used in [Animal Reiki Care](https://www.petworks.com/hire/animal-healers-reiki).

### **When is it good to use EFT?**

I’ve used EFT successfully on animals and their humans in situations like:

– Moving to a new location when everything seems unfamiliar and different.

– Separations/divorces and changes in the family structure by the birth or death of a member of the family when grief can take its toll in you and by connection.

– Medical treatments to support the body’s healing.

– Lack of performance as service animal or in competitions.

– Excessive barking or undesired behaviors like peeing outside the litter box for cats or kicking the stall for horses, I’ve seen these issues resolved very quickly after a session of communication and EFT combined.

– When the animal needs to start again with a new family. Especially if coming from a shelter or foster home. These are situations when the animal and their humans truly benefit from this technique to let go of any possible traumas from the past. It is my frequent suggestion to those who so kindly open their hearts and homes to animals in need to spend some time finding out what they have to say to you and to benefit from EFT to give them a chance for a great start in their new lives.

– Fears, starting with fireworks, loud noises, traffic, plastic bags (yes, I’ve had those) EFT is a very powerful to release fears from animals and humans too!

### **Can EFT Tapping Be Done At A Distance?**

What if your animal companion dislikes being touched? You can still practice EFT from a distance, and it works just as effectively through the power of intention. If your animal resists touch, perform “air” tapping by moving your hands near their body, tapping the specific points in the air while holding the clear intention that every action serves their benefit.

I often use surrogates as well. Another animal in the household may step in to help, and you’d be surprised how many eagerly do. I’ve also tapped using myself, the animal’s human, or even a stuffed animal that represents the companion. In every case, I direct the intention so that the tapping benefits your animal fully.

# Canine Reiki: How Energy Healing Can Help Your Dog

Canine Reiki: A Gentle Path to Wellness and Healing for Dogs. In recent years, holistic therapies have gained popularity not only among humans but also in the world of animal care. One such therapy that has been making waves in the realm of pet wellness is Reiki, a Japanese energy healing technique. While Reiki is often associated with human health, it has proven to be just as effective and beneficial for animals, particularly dogs. Canine Reiki is an emerging practice that offers a non-invasive, gentle approach to healing and wellness, addressing both the physical and emotional needs of our four-legged companions.
