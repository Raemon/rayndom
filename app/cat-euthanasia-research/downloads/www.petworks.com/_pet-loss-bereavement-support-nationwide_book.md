### [Pet Loss Bereavement Support - Nationwide](/en/listing/507611) by [Sandra Ferrell](/en/user/sef)

60-Minute Pet Loss Support Session

$50 Per Session 

**Please feel free to use discount code PW10 for 10% off your session.**   
  
**What to Expect**   
Each 60-minute session gives the pet parent an opportunity to share what they are experiencing around the loss of their much-loved pet, and to explore strategies to help with coping and healing. 

**To Book a 60-Minute Pet Loss Support Session**   
For new clients, please start by sending me a message with a few details about your pet loss and the type of support you are seeking. After we establish a day and time, you can feel free to click the BOOK NOW button to lock in the appointment. Payment is requested within 24-hours hours of setting the appointment.

**Cancellation Policy**   
I understand that conflicts can unexpectedly arise. However, if at all possible, I ask that you please notify me at least 24 hours in advance if a session needs to be cancelled or rescheduled. Cancellations made less than 24 hours before a scheduled session may incur a cancellation fee equal to the cost of the session, depending on the situation.

**Terms & Conditions**   
I provide bereavement support to adult pet parents (age 21+). By booking a pet loss bereavement session with me, you acknowledge that the aim is to provide compassionate support during your journey of pet loss, but is not intended to diagnose, treat, or cure any mental health condition and is not a replacement for licensed professional mental and/or medical health care. No specific results are guaranteed or implied.   
  
Thank you! I look forward to working with you soon.
