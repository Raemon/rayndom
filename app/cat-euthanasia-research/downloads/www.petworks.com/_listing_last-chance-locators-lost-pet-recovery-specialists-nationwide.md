Verified Member since Jul 2023 

Welcome to our Petworks listing: You will be working with Nita

Like many of our clients, I ( my friends) have also experinced losing a pet. We were also faced with not having many options to help locate lost or missing pets. But through our abilities, remote viewing, intution, energy work and MAP DOWSING , we were able to bring Shelby home safely.

Since then we have been practicing map dowsing ever since the Shelby incident, challenging each other to find pets and items in each other's homes, and offering our services to humans who have lost their animals. After mastering the skill we have put it to the test and have been very successful in locating lost animals, from cats, dogs and turtles, to bearded dragons. (and personal items).

****** NOTE WE ARE WORKING WITH ANIMALS THEY MOVE FAST AND HAVE FREE WILL, ALSO TIME FRAMES AND FOLLOW THROUGH OF THE OWNER IS CRITICAL TO BE SUCCESSFUL. WE CAN NOT GUARANTEE 100%, HOWEVER WE APPROACH EVERY SESSION IN HOPES OF SUCCESSFUL OUT COME. 

Please contact and book us on PetWorks. Thank You. Nita

Nita is AMAZING! She consistently helped me for days and together we ended up finding my sweet cat, Skitzie!

**\- Nicole Z**

**\- Marrissa P**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

Awe thank you, I can say the same about you …

Nita 

**\- Nita Gomez**

Nita was amazing, caring and so helpful in finding our cat. The locations she pin dropped to look for Maui were right within where she was and cats are moving all the time. She could tell Maui's energy in wanting to come home and that she got lost when she was chased by something from our yard. Nita gave me lots of things to try to help me connect with her as well. I cannot express how impressed I am with her! Thank you again Nita!!

**\- LeAnn P**

Honestly although I like "woo woo" stuff it's hard for me to have conviction but this experience is spooky enough to raise eyebrows. I live in a rural area where each lot is 40 acres. Even though multiple pet detectives were certain that my missing indoor cat would be hiding close to home, Nita pegged her as being beyond my property, past a lot of open space. The next day (day 5 of being missing) she was found at a neighbor's house, 1/3 mile away from home.

Nita also sent me a video to intuitively help guide my cat to safety, which I started doing on day 3, and it turns out those neighbors have a lot of livestock, guardian dogs, and cats (my cat hates cats), but none of their animals were on the property because they were moving so my cat did not have to encounter any of their animals who would have attacked her. There are also 3 known coyote packs that roam their property, and owls have been active (my cat is less than 6 pounds so owl food sized). The neighbors also go between the two houses so they're not always there. And they rescue animals so they were knowledgeable and could tell that our cat was elderly despite looking like a juvenile, had no teeth, and was a pet. So it turned out to be extremely lucky circumstances that our cat avoided harm, especially because she is also deaf, and ended up with good people. Spooky.

**\- Cindy D**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

What an amazing story …. I am so glad she had so many angels looking after her . Thank you so much for trusting me . 

**\- Nita Gomez**

Everything went well and she provided the insight needed.

Nita advised on where I would find our cat. She was right! Our cat is home safe & everything worked out. 

**\- Kristina M**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

Thank you ! 

**\- Nita Gomez**

Nita was very pleasant and full of heart to help. She diligently worked with my son and gave him areas to assist in locating Stella. Each route she sent him would have him return down one road and back past a empty warehouse lot. My son decided to check the lot because he thought it was odd that it kept coming up in the path. Stella is found in the back of the lot layind down in a fenced in grassy area. We can’t thank Nita enough for all her help. We definitely recommend her

**\- Denise B**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

Thank you so very much, I am glad Stella is back home and safe ! 

**\- Nita Gomez**

My experience was positive. Nita was prompt at responding to my request for assistance with finding my lost cat. She was able to figure out her approximate location. She communicated with me via email and over the phone. She was a pleasure to work with.

**\- Catherine B**

Nita was absolutely amazing. I was very skeptical at first and thought I was just paying for some scam but it wasnt. i used her along with Search team With a bloodhound and put flyers everywhere. The issue is I live in the mountains with countless coyotes and a bobcat. It has now been one week straight, and I still have not found the best friend of my life was able to pinpoint locations on where to go and tell me if he was alive, in body or not. She was very helpful in me connecting with my lost family member And it’s just a matter that he got taken and killed on site. I appreciate her over the top efforts and I now know it wasn’t a scam which makes me feel better. I definitely recommend her.

**\- Bodhi W**

**\- Nita Gomez**

I can't say enough great things about Nita! She is such a caring soul who really goes above and beyond to help find your lost pet. Our cat told her he would be coming home one night and he did! Unfortunately he got scared away by a dog but it's comforting to know he is nearby....like she said, he knew his way home. 

**\- Stephanie B**

She is amazing , helped find our cat who was 2 miles away and up a tree.

**\- Virginia T**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

Thank you for the feed back !!!!

**\- Nita Gomez**

Nita is an absolute superstar! I contacted Nita when I was losing hope of ever seeing my 14 year old house cat that had been missing for 9 days.   
Nita was able to locate her in a neighbor's shed and then help get her back her through a field and eventually track her to a piece of old farm machinery she had used for shelter during a severe rain and wind storm. On day 12, by using Nita's advice and trusting her techniques, I was reunited with the cat I was afraid I would never see again! She is a true friend to the animal and a supporter to their human. I can't thank her enough!!!!!

**\- Linda C**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

Thank you so much ! It was great working with you both ! 

**\- Nita Gomez**

We have been unable to find our lost little one so far, but Nita went above and beyond what I bargained for and is very supportive. Highly recommend

**\- Asyia M**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

**\- Nita Gomez**

Nita went above expectations in trying to locate Luna. She gave us hope and direction though we could not track her down. She also worked us in right away when we had a snowstorm moving in with cold temps. We were told she is smart and hope for her return. Thank you, Nita,!

**\- Terri P**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

Thank you ! 

**\- Nita Gomez**

Nita helped with mapping and follow up. It was an idea suggested that brought kitty back home and successfully trapped. He is oh SO happy to be snuggled and warm again! Thanks so much Nita!!

**\- Terri P**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

Thank you, it was very nice to work with again. 

**\- Nita Gomez**

I have been searching for my cat with my full efforts like most lost pet owners have.   
The most useful way to look for your lost pet is to get help from Lost pet finder / Lost pet detectives. If researched properly it will only cost a little over 150-200. Map dowsing is a risky deal just like palm reading or horoscope reading.   
I understand we people out there are desperate to find our dear pets but do not fall for good reviews like I did. It did not work for me but gave me false hopes , which is a worser feeling tbh.   
Good luck to all lost pet parents in their search and I hope you find the right resources to search for your pet !! ( try feline finders or something similar to that, google gives you a list pet finders , wish I saw it sooner )   
Honestly , a dog search for a lost cat or lost dog has more leads than any psychic stuff. Remember reviews are not always true story ( atleast this is my opinion or view after my experience)   
I genuinely hope this helps ! 

**\- Swathi D**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

Hi Swathi,

I appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts. I understand that you may have been hoping for a different experience, and I’m sorry to hear that my work didn’t meet your expectations.

What I do takes time, patience, and compassion, and while I strive to be as accommodating as possible, I am unable to provide services in the middle of the night. The positive reviews on my website reflect the experiences of many who have found value in my work, and I hope, in time, you might see that as well.

Wishing you all the best, 

**\- Nita Gomez**

The most useful way to look for your lost pet is to get help from Lost pet finder / Lost pet detectives. If researched properly it will only cost a little over 150-200. Map dowsing is a risky deal just like palm reading or horoscope reading.   
I understand we people out there are desperate to find our dear pets but do not fall for good reviews like I did. It did not work for me but gave me false hopes , which is a worser feeling tbh.   
Good luck to all lost pet parents in their search and I hope you find the right resources to search for your pet !! ( try feline finders or something similar to that, google gives you a list pet finders , wish I saw it sooner )   
Honestly , a dog search for a lost cat or lost dog has more leads than any psychic stuff. Remember reviews are not always true story ( atleast this is my opinion or view after my experience)   
I genuinely hope this helps !

##### Pet Pro Response:

Hi Swathi,

I appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts. I understand that you may have been hoping for a different experience, and I’m sorry to hear that my work didn’t meet your expectations.

What I do takes time, patience, and compassion, and while I strive to be as accommodating as possible, I am unable to provide services in the middle of the night. The positive reviews on my website reflect the experiences of many who have found value in my work, and I hope, in time, you might see that as well.

Wishing you all the best,
