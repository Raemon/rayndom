### [Certified Pet Loss Grief Counseling Professional - Nationwide](/en/listing/510023) by [Cindy Cooley](/en/user/lovingcare)

Pre Pet Loss Session

$65 Per 60 Minutes 

By planning ahead and understanding your options in advance of your pet's final goodbye, you can ease some of the stress and truly cherish your last moments together. Pre Pet Loss helps pet owners to pre-plan wishes for burial or cremation as well as share stories about their pet and share how this has impacted the family before the day of passing.

Post Pet Loss

$150 Per Package 

This 4-meeting session (one day a week) is focused on offering pet owners an effective impact for taking action to move through and beyond their grief. These four weeks will allow the griever the chance to say “goodbye” to their relationship with this special pet, thereby making it comfortable to build a relationship with a new pet, if they choose to do so.
