Never assume a dog or cat won't be reactive at any given moment, and when it happens it happens in milliseconds 

#### What is one thing you want pet parents to know about you? It can be whatev-fur you'd like!

After graduating college in 1997 in exercise science & athletic training... I was determined to revolutionize animal healthcare, but animal rehab/chiro didn't really exist. So nearly 20 years after I graduated chiropractic school and had two decades of a very successful human practice, professional sports around the world and a corporate healthcare job for nearly a decade, I decided to finally make good on a life-long dream and become an animal chiro/rehab dr. I grew up with various dogs in childhood and college (German Shepherds, big mutts from the pound) but I have been a cat mom for the last 22 years and currently mother to two Ocicats who are both leash trained and registered show cats!
