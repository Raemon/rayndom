# Dolce’s Legacy - Animal Nutrition Care - Nationwide

(1 review)

Verified Member since Jun 2024 

Whether you're grappling with the relentless itch of yeasty, hot skin or facing the daunting reality of a cancer diagnosis, the emotional turmoil remains constant…

Information Paralysis 

"Feeling overwhelmed by the variety of pet food options available, that fit their specific health issues?"   
"Are you questioning if the treatments you’ve chosen are truly the best for your pet?"   
“Feeling torn between natural remedies and conventional cancer care for your pet?”   
"She’s losing weight and muscle tone despite my efforts, and I feel powerless to stop it."

Isolation

"The cost of palliative care makes me feel trapped between financial strain and my dog’s comfort."   
"I don’t feel like others understand what I’m going through with my dog’s condition."   
“I’ve pulled away from friends and family because I’m so focused on her care."   
“It feels like there’s no one to turn to who truly gets the emotional and practical challenges of this stage."

"Empowering You to Be Your Pet's Health Advocate"

The feelings of despair, frustration, and isolation weave through each experience, reminding us that the burden of illness, regardless of its nature, impacts our hearts and minds in profound ways. It's a journey where the physical symptoms may vary, but the emotional struggle unites us all in a shared search for understanding, support, and hope.

Holistic Nutrition and Care Tailored to Enhance Their Mind, Body, and Spirit, Fostering a Life of Balance and Joy."

For so long, our pets have been our heroes, bringing unconditional love, joy and companionship into our lives. Let me guide you in providing the love and holistic care they deserve. Now, it's your turn to be the “hero” in their journey!

#### Pricing Packages

2 Hr Consultation for Oncology

$ 210.00 Per 60 minutes [book](/dolces-legacy-animal-nutrition-care-nationwide/book?id=7104)

1 - 2 Hour Consultations are 210$ I’m usually booked out 2 weeks in advanced. Cancer and other serious conditions skip to the head of the line will take about 2.5 hours. Weeks can be precious wasted time that they don’t have an excess of. We certainly won’t be wasting it waiting on me to clear out my schedule!

One thing you will never purchase from me is a “RECIPE”. I absolutely refuse to sell a “diet” or “recipe” that conforms to the masses. I will not refund a consultation fee after I’ve spent the hour with you. YOU will be required to take notes for our consultation, (most consultations run over on time so be sure to allow this in your schedule) please be prepared.

We work with the animal in front of us! What does this body specifically require? We are individuals and have our own nutritional needs… they do too!

First and foremost this Hour belongs to you! So please don’t feel like this is just to hear me ramble on about nutrition. I want this hour to be tailored to your needs. More to the point your canine and feline’s needs. Don’t know what to ask? That’s ok I’m here for it and happy to take over the discussion so that we can touch base on finer key points. Most consultations do run over the 1 hour mark, so make sure you’ve allotted an appropriate amount of time for us. I DO NOT work just the one pet, I work the entire household. It does us no good to change how we feed a dog (example) with Pancreatic flairs, and not correct how we feed the whole house. I educate us on being reactive towards body A with said condition and proactive with body B.

So often many of my clients come to me after they’ve received the one diagnosis none of us ever want to hear… “CANCER”… My Goal, is redefining the way we “Live” with Cancer. Cancer does not define us!

In our cancer consultations, we take a comprehensive approach to support your dog's health, focusing on food therapy and energetics tailored to their specific requirements. Our discussions include crucial dietary elements that should be incorporated, as well as foods to avoid entirely, ensuring that your dog receives the best possible nutritional support throughout their journey.

We emphasize the importance of flushing the lymphatic system, which plays a vital role in maintaining overall health and wellness. Additionally, we explore homeopathy and herbal modalities that are specifically designed to meet your dog's unique needs, fostering a holistic nurturing environment.
