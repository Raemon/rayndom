Initial Lost Animal Consultation (includes map dowsing)

$210 Per Session 

This type of consultation includes one round of map dowsing, one communication session with the lost animal, a map of the area where the animal's energy is the strongest at the time the map dowsing is completed and a detailed e-mail with the information that I receive. This type of consultation does not include a phone call. 

Upon receipt of your booking, I will need the following information to be provided:   
*A digital or scanned picture of the lost animal   
*The lost animal's name and gender   
*The date the animal was lost   
*Your home address or the address from where the animal went missing   
*Address(es) and date(s) where the animal was last seen (which may be the same as your home address)   
*Your phone number (used if the information warrants a phone call rather than an e-mail). NOTE: If you are located outside of the United States, I will provide the phone number for you to call me at a prearranged date and time, if warranted.

I will only contact you by phone if I find that the missing animal has made its transition or if information that I receive needs your immediate attention. Otherwise, so that you can have the information to print off and take with you while you conduct your search, I will provide you with the information that I receive via my reply on the Petworks platform.

Please keep in mind that there are no guarantees that your missing animal will return home or be found.

If I determine that he/she has made their transition, I will contact you by phone. 

If I determine that the missing animal is alive, I’ll let you know if he/she is getting food and water, if he/she is sick or injured, and if he/she has found shelter or remains outdoors. I will provide you with this information via the Petworks platform when I respond to you.

DISTANCE REIKI ENERGY HEALING SESSION (30 minutes)

$120 Per 30 Minutes 

This 30-minute distance Reiki energy healing session for your pet can be split into two 15-minute sessions over two days, if needed.

Prior to the session, please provide me with an overview of the challenges that your pet is experiencing so that I will know what to focus on. 

In addition, please provide me with the name and a photo of your pet via the Petworks platform. 

The majority of Reiki energy healing sessions that I do are done late at night or during the day when your pet is less active and less distracted. After the session is completed, I will provide you with an update to let you know how the session went and what energy blockages (if any) were found and cleared.
