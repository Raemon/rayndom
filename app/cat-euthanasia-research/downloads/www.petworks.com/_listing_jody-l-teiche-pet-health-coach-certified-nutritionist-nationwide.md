#### Pricing Packages

Nutrition Consult

$ 175.00 Per 60 minutes [book](/jody-l-teiche-pet-health-coach-certified-nutritionist-nationwide/book?id=1009)

If you're unsure about what you're feeding or what to believe online, or if your dog or cat are having health issues, a nutrition consult could be very helpful in starting to solve or completely solving the problem. We will go over your pet's diet, supplements, any symptoms you're noticing and I'll work with you to create a nutrition plan that is designed to create more energy, youthfulness and good health.   
Client testimonial: “My dog has never been healthier! I am so incredibly grateful for Jody. My sweet Mia is an 11-year-old Maltipoo. She had been struggling for the last few years with inconsistent bowels, blood in stools, hacking and coughing, bouts of not eating, vomiting bile and regurgitating food. I spent thousands of dollars over the years trying different food, different medications, vet visits and even a dog cardiologist.   
I found Jody and she has completely changed our lives. Its been a year now, and Mia hasn’t had any blood in her stools and has not thrown up yellow bile. This is the longest time she was a puppy that she hasn’t had some sort of stomach/bowel issue. I HIGHLY recommend Jody.” – Chloe C.

Homeopathy Consult

$ 350.00 Per 90 minutes [book](/jody-l-teiche-pet-health-coach-certified-nutritionist-nationwide/book?id=1010)

If your pet has specific issues that are acute or chronic, homeopathy can be very effective. I will take your pet's case, where you'll describe their symptoms, we'll go over their history and I'll recommend a homeopathic remedy, teach you how to use, what to look for and create a plan moving forward. We will have follow up consults so I can see how things are going and what you are observing. Those follow up consults are $2.50 a minute and usually last between 10 - 30 minutes. We will work together until we have achieved our goals.

If your dog or cat suffers from anxiety, whether it's separation anxiety, fear of loud noises, the car, strangers or certain textures, it can be debilitating for them and a heartbreak to watch for you. In my consult, I will assess the type of anxiety your pet suffers from, create the best plan forward to calm them and teach them to calm themselves, and create to confidence in them, resulting in a happier, more vibrant animal and a happier you. 

Anxiety Package

$ 999.00 Per Package [book](/jody-l-teiche-pet-health-coach-certified-nutritionist-nationwide/book?id=5354)

We will create a plan together, using tools that calm and develop confidence in anxious dogs and cats. I will guide you in how to teach your pet to calm themselves and actually rewire their brains for this purpose.   
At the end of the two months, you will be empowered to manage and continue to improve your pet's anxiety and will see a marked difference in the way they cope with stress and how they feel. You will finally be able to breathe easier, knowing you not only see the light at the end of the tunnel but see the results of moving toward that light and freedom for them and you.   
A client testimonial about our work together to help his reactive, anxious dog: “Working with Jody has been fantastic.

Good morning Jody – super health magician!!! Charlie’s itching seems to have come to a complete halt!!! YAY! THANK YOU!!! After waking yesterday still with major itching, he had the thuja remedy around 11:30, and I only saw one more itch late afternoon. Short, and no more at all!!! A miracle! - Austin, Texas

**\- Jill C**

Jody knows a lot regarding holistic health for pets. She recommended a raw meat diet for my dog, and informed me how to calm, train and connect to my beloved pet. She is very experienced and knowledgeable in all aspects of pet behaviors, and will save you thousands of dollars in future vet bills. Definitely worth the investment. Thank you, Jody! - Vancouver Island, B.C.

**\- Sylvia C**

Jody was very professional in her communication and helped me with my small two year old dog to find a nutrition plan that promoted better health. She gave me a list of supplements and food ideas to add to his nutrition plan and ensure he continues to live a healthy, long life. She helped me with suggestions for my vet and how to find a more holistic vet who would agree with how I would like to raise my dog to promote health. I would recommend Jody for guidance on how to keep your dog healthy with the most holistic current approach to pet wellness. - Fort Worth, TX
