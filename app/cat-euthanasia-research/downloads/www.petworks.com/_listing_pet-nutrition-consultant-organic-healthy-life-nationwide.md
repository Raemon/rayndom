## Customer Reviews

Nancy was so great and understanding. She gave me good advice and knowledge that I’ll use to make my overall situation better. I not only recommend her for others, but will reach out to her for future needs myself. Thank you Nancy!! 

**\- Douglas H**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

Bless you. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance.

**\- Nancy Addison**

Loved talking with Nancy, she is so knowledgeable and she definitely gave me a lot of things to think about. I appreciate her efforts and you can tell how much she cares! 

**\- Kaitlyn C**

You are amazing Nancy and so kind to share your insights. It’s been two months I have been giving Superfoods to my dog, Zauro. Last week, we got his KFT (kidney functioning test) done as a part of regular quarterly checkup and I was surprised to see that not only his reports were completely normal but his creatinine levels have reduced from the last time when I wasn’t incorporating the super greens. Otherwise also, his appetite has improved and he more energetic than ever.   
Now, because of your guidance, I would be able to extend the same benefits to others in my country.   
I want to highlight that Nancy has taken all my queries and requests personally. She always attends to my doubts and would go to lengths to explain the plausible reasons behind the problem.   
I want to thank you a BIG time for this.

I am so grateful that I found Nancy! My dog had been poisoned and after multiple vet visits , no one could help her, but Nancy has been working with me to get her detoxed and she is finally able to keep her food down and has started gaining weight. And as a bonus she has helped me improve my health.   
Nancy always replies promptly and takes the time to answer all my questions. It is obvious that she is very knowledgeable and genuinely cares about our animals. Karen and Laci

**\- Nancy Addison**

If I could give 10 stars I would! I was helped immediately, and Nancy is extremely knowledgeable about pet health and nutrition, as well as peoples health and nutrition! She gave me so many amazing ideas, and I learned tons of things I didn’t know! Nancy has truly saved my dogs life! My Bella has severe allergies, and we’ve spent well over $15,000 in vet bills, medications, shots etc, and no one, not even my vets, have been able to help me with a well balanced recipe to make her food, but within minutes Nancy had me several recipes! She actually listened and found alternative ingredients instead of doing like everyone else and throwing me a generic recipe and telling me to just exclude what Bella can’t have. There was even a recipe for treats!! ❤️ Bella has lost so much weight that I was afraid she wouldn’t be with us much longer, but Nancy has restored all hopes, and has given me multiple options to help her bounce back! She even gave me some help with my own health and nutrition! I also highly recommend checking out all of her books! She has information for all of your health and nutrition needs, as well as your pets!! Best money I’ve ever spent!! Thank you SO MUCH Nancy!!! 

**\- Brandy T**

##### Pet Pro's Response:

I am honored to know you Brandy. Thank you for the kind words and for contacting me for your pet's needs.

## Customer Reviews

Nancy was so great and understanding. She gave me good advice and knowledge that I’ll use to make my overall situation better. I not only recommend her for others, but will reach out to her for future needs myself. Thank you Nancy!! 

**\- Douglas H**

##### Pet Pro Response:

Bless you. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance.

**\- Nancy Addison**

Loved talking with Nancy, she is so knowledgeable and she definitely gave me a lot of things to think about. I appreciate her efforts and you can tell how much she cares! 

**\- Kaitlyn C**

You are amazing Nancy and so kind to share your insights. It’s been two months I have been giving Superfoods to my dog, Zauro. Last week, we got his KFT (kidney functioning test) done as a part of regular quarterly checkup and I was surprised to see that not only his reports were completely normal but his creatinine levels have reduced from the last time when I wasn’t incorporating the super greens. Otherwise also, his appetite has improved and he more energetic than ever.   
Now, because of your guidance, I would be able to extend the same benefits to others in my country.   
I want to highlight that Nancy has taken all my queries and requests personally. She always attends to my doubts and would go to lengths to explain the plausible reasons behind the problem.   
I want to thank you a BIG time for this.

**\- Angelette L**

I am so grateful that I found Nancy! My dog had been poisoned and after multiple vet visits , no one could help her, but Nancy has been working with me to get her detoxed and she is finally able to keep her food down and has started gaining weight. And as a bonus she has helped me improve my health.   
Nancy always replies promptly and takes the time to answer all my questions. It is obvious that she is very knowledgeable and genuinely cares about our animals. Karen and Laci

Today was the first time I met with Nancy. We talked about lifestyle changes for my miniature poodle with congestive heart failure, and a good plan for a 1.4 year old belgium malinois. Interestingly she explained to me there's a lot of cross over with human nutrition as well. I was impressed and motivated I booked and we had a back to back session for me as well. She gives alot of information, and I'm excited to try this stuff out for my dogs and me. She's a very professional, kind, sincere, helpful person.

**\- Nancy Addison**

If I could give 10 stars I would! I was helped immediately, and Nancy is extremely knowledgeable about pet health and nutrition, as well as peoples health and nutrition! She gave me so many amazing ideas, and I learned tons of things I didn’t know! Nancy has truly saved my dogs life! My Bella has severe allergies, and we’ve spent well over $15,000 in vet bills, medications, shots etc, and no one, not even my vets, have been able to help me with a well balanced recipe to make her food, but within minutes Nancy had me several recipes! She actually listened and found alternative ingredients instead of doing like everyone else and throwing me a generic recipe and telling me to just exclude what Bella can’t have. There was even a recipe for treats!! ❤️ Bella has lost so much weight that I was afraid she wouldn’t be with us much longer, but Nancy has restored all hopes, and has given me multiple options to help her bounce back! She even gave me some help with my own health and nutrition! I also highly recommend checking out all of her books! She has information for all of your health and nutrition needs, as well as your pets!! Best money I’ve ever spent!! Thank you SO MUCH Nancy!!!
