### Distinction

## Customer Reviews

Our family is so grateful for CodaPet. Two days ago we made the difficult decision to free our senior dog from her painful body. I was able to schedule an appointment for the following day. My anxiety was extremely high all morning, but the moment Dr. Sarah Crozier stepped foot in our home I felt at ease. She made a really difficult experience peaceful and beautiful. She brought yummy snacks for our dog, and explained everything she was doing along the way. We got to share stories about our dog, we laughed, and we cried. She stepped outside while we said our final goodbyes (our other dog included) and gave us as much time as we needed. We never felt rushed, and she was extremely compassionate. The cost of the service is worth every penny. Our beloved dog was able to pass away in her favorite bed surrounded by her favorite people. I highly recommend CodaPet to anyone needing euthanasia service. - Vancouver, WA - December 2025

We were very impressed with CodaPet and the way Dr. Claire Gibson made every accommodation to make the family comfortable at such a difficult time. We were even more impressed with the gentle way you treated our sweet Bailey Girl with her transition. You certainly were an angel of compassion at a time when a physically and mentally exhausted family was in need of a helping hand. You are definitely a credit to your profession and I highly recommend your organization to anyone who should have a need for your services. More importantly, I believe that you are a genuinely good and caring person and I am glad that you were a part of this time in our lives. Thank you for all of your help! - September 2025

My sweet Daisy dog was euthanized last night by Dr Lauren Silvesti of CodaPet. My heart is broken, but the experience was so much more comfortable at home, than at the vets office. Sr Silvesti asked many questions about Daisy life, getting to know her. Daisy was very comfortable with Dr Silvesti, even though she was a stranger to her. Dr was very kind and comforting to us also. She explained the process she would use with Daisy, and options for cremation. She took her time with Daisy, no rushing. Gave her a sedative to calm her before giving her an injection to fall asleep, and then the drug to stop her heart. We had time to tell Daisy how much we loved her, before she left us. She put Daisys favorite toy between IDaisys) front legs. Daisy looked like a sleeping puppy hugging her toy, before she was taken away.   
I could not bear to put Daisy thru going to our vets office (which she hated going to) to be euthanized. It was peaceful for Daisy, which was a comfort to us. My heart is heavy, but Daisy is released from misery. I highly recommend Dr Sylvesti and CodaPet.
