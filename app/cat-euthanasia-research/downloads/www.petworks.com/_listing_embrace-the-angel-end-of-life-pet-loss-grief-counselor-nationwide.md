# Embrace the Angel End-of-Life - Pet Loss Grief Counselor - Nationwide

(3 reviews)

Verified Member since May 2022 

From the moment you met your beloved companion, you felt it—a heart-to-heart connection, a profound Knowing. Now, as you face the final chapter of your physical life together, you’re seeking comfort, clarity, and a way to ease the heartbreak of saying goodbye.

Our animals are our Anam Cara—Soul Friends whose unconditional love, loyalty, and intuitive presence shape our lives in ways that can never be replaced. That bond doesn’t end. It simply changes.

With over 45 years of experience supporting the dying and those they leave behind, I walk beside you with compassion, presence, and deep respect for the love you share. I hold Sacred Space for both you and your pet, helping you navigate anticipatory grief, end-of-life decisions, and the tender moments that matter most.

I am a Certified Life Coach, End-of-Life Doula, and Certified Grief Educator trained by David Kessler. I also moderate his Tender Hearts grief support groups (Grief.com) every Monday. Working with bereaved parents has allowed me to grow my compassion, caring, and courage as we navigate grief. Above all, I am a woman who listens with her whole heart and honors the sacred bond between people and their animals.

I'll just be DIFFERENT." I physically felt her leave her body and move into The Light. She never left. She simply "changed." I am SO blessed!

I felt a weight lift after talking with Patti. She was very present, kind, and genuine. Her desire to talk about Jozi and ask questions about her shifted things to a more positive perspective. While my heart still aches in this grief journey, I am opening myself up more to the truth that I loved her well and everything happened right on time. I’m so grateful to Patti for helping me with my guilt to transform it into loving memories. Book Patti. You won’t regret it.
