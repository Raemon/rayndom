# Naomi's Light - Certified Pet Loss Grief Counselor - Nationwide

(1 review)

Verified Member since Feb 2023 

I am a Pet Loss Support Specialist through Pet Loss Partners, a Certified Animal Hospice Practitioner through the Animal Hospice Group and an Animal Reiki Practitioner trained in the Let Animals Lead method by Kathleen Prasad. I am also an adoption counselor at my local shelter.   
I also have an MS in Counseling.

I help pet parents when they have experienced the loss of their beloved animal in private sessions and group sessions. I also do Animal Reiki sessions for pet parents and animals that are ready to or have already transitioned and to help pet parents that have recently adopted a rescue animal. All sessions are in person and via zoom.
