**PAA**

**Is chiropractic care safe and effective for cats?**

Yes, when performed by a certified animal chiropractor, chiropractic care is generally safe and can be very effective for cats. Pet parents in South Carolina often seek chiropractic adjustments for their cats to help improve mobility, relieve stiffness, support post-injury recovery, or reduce chronic pain, especially in older cats or those with musculoskeletal issues. A professional animal chiropractor will conduct a full assessment before beginning any treatment, ensuring it’s appropriate for your cat’s specific condition.

**How much does it cost to take my cat to an animal chiropractor in South Carolina?**

The cost of feline chiropractic care in South Carolina typically ranges from $60 to $150 per session, depending on the provider’s experience, session length, and whether it’s an in-home or in-clinic visit. Some chiropractors offer discounts for multiple sessions or follow-up packages. It’s best to ask if the chiropractor offers a consultation fee or includes an initial assessment in the first visit’s cost.
