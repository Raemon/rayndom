I will also ask you to send me a couple of pictures of your pup so I can get a general idea of what he/she looks like.

$175 Per 60 Minutes

Fix My Recipe

$50 Per Recipe 

You're already ahead of the game - you're cooking for your dog! That’s amazing. But if you grabbed your recipe from a Facebook group, a random blog, or can't even remember where it came from… there’s a 95% chance it’s not complete and balanced.

Let’s fix that.

Even the healthiest fresh ingredients can fall short if key nutrients are missing. And if you’re feeding the same unbalanced recipe long-term, nutrient deficiencies can slowly creep in - affecting your dog’s energy, immune system, and overall health.

Save time. Stop guessing. Start nourishing.

Instead of asking for opinions from strangers in online forums, send me your dog’s recipe and how you prepare it. I’ll analyze and revise your recipe to ensure it’s nutritionally complete.

What you’ll get:   
• Clear ingredient adjustments   
• Additional ingredient/supplement recommendations (with links)   
• Revised, balanced recipe delivered within 3 business days   
• Reply to one follow-up email for clarification (not recipe reworking), valid within 5 days of delivery

Please note: This is a recipe balancing service only and does not include a consultation. It won’t assess whether the recipe is ideal for your dog’s unique needs - just that it’s nutritionally complete.

As a Certified Professional Canine Nutritionist, I don’t recommend feeding the same recipe long-term. Rotating ingredients and recipes is key to avoiding sensitivities and providing variety.   
If your dog has health concerns like kidney disease, pancreatitis, elevated liver enzymes, or food sensitivities, or if you’d like recipes tailored to your dog’s individual needs, please book a 60-minute consultation on this page.
