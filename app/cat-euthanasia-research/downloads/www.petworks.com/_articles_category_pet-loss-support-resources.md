Pet Loss Support Resources

Losing a pet is an incredibly painful experience, as pets are considered beloved family members. Finding [pet loss support](https://www.petworks.com/hire/pet-loss-support) resources is an important step in navigating the grief and finding comfort during this difficult time. Support can come in many forms. Talking to friends and family who understand the deep bond you shared with your pet. Or, joining a pet loss support group where others who have experienced similar losses can offer empathy and understanding.

Professional help is also available through pet bereavement counselors. They specialize in helping pet owners process their emotions and find healthy ways to cope with the loss. Many online resources and communities provide a safe space to share memories, express feelings, and receive encouragement from others who truly understand what you’re going through. This is particularly helpful if you’re looking for support at any time of day, or, if you prefer the anonymity that online spaces can offer.

Some people find solace in memorializing their pets through creative outlets. For example, writing, creating a photo album, or commissioning a custom pet portrait. No matter the method, the key is to allow yourself to grieve in a way that feels right for you. Seeking and getting pet loss support helps to validate your feelings. This provides a path toward healing, ensuring that your pet’s memory lives on in a positive and cherished way.

The cost of a pet loss support therapist session can vary depending on several factors, including the therapist’s experience, location, and whether the session is in-person or virtual. On average, a pet loss therapy session typically ranges from $50 to $150 per hour. Group sessions or support groups might be less expensive, often costing between $25 and $50 per session. Some therapists also offer sliding scale fees or packages that lower the overall cost. Online platforms such as Petworks may provide more affordable options as well, depending on the services you’re seeking.
