## University of Richmond: Pet, ESA, and Service Animal Policy (2026)

At the University of Richmond, the general rule is that ordinary pets are **not allowed** in campus housing or academic facilities. However, exceptions are made for **Service Animals** and **Emotional Support Animals (ESAs)** , provided the proper procedures are followed under disability accommodations.

### Service Animals

  * Defined under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), a Service Animal must be a **dog** (or miniature horse in rare cases) that is individually trained to perform specific tasks directly related to a person’s disability.

  * Handlers—whether students or staff—must undergo a streamlined registration process. Queries are limited to confirming whether the animal is required due to a disability and what task it’s trained to perform.

  * Service Animals and ESAs approved for housing must provide annually:

    * Proof of **current vaccinations**

    * Evidence of **flea and tick prevention**

    * An **emergency contact** to care for the animal if needed.

  * If a Service Animal loses control, poses a safety risk, or causes damage, the university may require its removal—but the person retains housing access.




### Emotional Support Animals (ESAs)

  * Unlike Service Animals, ESAs are not trained to perform specific tasks—but they can still be approved as a **reasonable accommodation** under federal housing laws including the Fair Housing Act.

  * Students seeking an ESA in **on-campus housing** must follow a multi-step process managed by the **Housing Accommodation Committee** , which includes:

    1. Submitting an ESA application

    2. Providing professional documentation linking the individual’s disability to the need for the ESA

    3. Participating in an intake meeting

    4. Completing roommate agreement forms and a campus animal agreement

    5. Designating an emergency care contact

    6. Final intake to confirm approval disability.

  * Documentation must come from a treating professional—not an online form or certificate, to ensure legitimacy disability.

  * Approved ESAs must also comply with the same annual requirements as Service Animals (vaccines, flea/tick prevention, emergency contact) UVA Policy.




### Key Distinction: ESA vs. Service Animal

Feature | Service Animal | Emotional Support Animal (ESA)  
---|---|---  
Purpose | Performs trained tasks for a disability (ADA) | Provides emotional comfort (Fair Housing Act)  
Areas Accessed | Broad campus access, including common areas | Typically limited to housing; classroom access varies  
Documentation | Minimal questions allowed under ADA | Requires thorough documentation from provider  
Annual Requirements | Vaccinations, pest prevention, emergency contact | Same as Service Animal when approved  
  
### Richmond Pet-Friendly Community Events

Here are some standout gatherings that bring the pet-loving community together across Richmond:

  * **RVA Dog Pack Pack Walks** : Organized group walks that raise funds for local rescues like Henrico Humane Society while offering spontaneous pop-up strolls and community camaraderie RVA Dog Pack.

  * **Richmond SPCA’s Dog Jog, 5K & Block Party**: Held in March, this beloved annual event includes a chip-timed 5K run, Kids’ Fun Run, Dog Jog, and a lively Block Party with music, vendors, and pet activities. [CEO Tamsen Kingry](https://richmondspca.org/who-we-are/about-us/staff-board-of-directors/meet-our-executive-team/) notes how it has become “a cherished tradition that brings together our community in support of homeless pets,” aiming to raise $215,000 Richmond SPCA.

  * **Woofstock Festival (Richmond Animal League)** : This free, family- and dog-friendly outdoor festival features a pet parade, dozens of local vendors, live music, and adoption opportunities Richmond Animal League.

  * **Fidos After 5 at Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden** : On select summer evenings (second and fourth Thursdays between June and mid-September), leashed dogs are welcome to enjoy the garden, food, and drinks…often with a small pet admission fee that benefits the Richmond SPCA Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden. 

  * **Pups, Plates & Pours Weekend**: A celebration of Richmond’s pet-friendly businesses, where attendees can dine, sip, and stroll with their pets while supporting the Richmond SPCA,,,10% of proceeds go toward lifesaving work.
