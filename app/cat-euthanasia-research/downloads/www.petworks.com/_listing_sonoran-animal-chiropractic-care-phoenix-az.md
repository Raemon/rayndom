# Sonoran Animal Chiropractic Care - Phoenix, AZ

(2 reviews)

Member since Jul 2020 

Chiropractic care can be used to help your pet manage many life stages. A chiropractic adjustment removes any interference there may be to your pet's overall nervous system. By removing this interference, we are allowing the body to communicate more efficiently from the brain to the rest of the body. Adjustments can reduce pain and inflammation, improve flexibility, restore normal function, an overall increase in quality of life. The signs and symptoms that your pet may need an adjustment vary greatly from animal to animal. The typical signs that are often seen are reduced activity, shortened stride length, decrease in desire to play or go on walks, decreased performance, resistance to pick up leads or turn in certain directions, and many more! Reach out to Sonoran Animal Chiropractic to ensure that your pet is living the best life possible!

I can't recommend Dr Kristen & Sonoran Animal Chiropractic services enough! If I could give 10 stars I would. My Ridgeback/Catahoula Mix has always been super active as she is a medical alert dog. Over the last year she had been slowing down significantly. I just put it off as "old age". In February I took her to our regular general practice veterinarian thinking she may have torn her CCL as she was limping and not weight bearing at all. After X-rays we confirmed some pretty bad arthritis in her hips. Our regular vet prescribed some anti-inflammatories & said there wasn't much else we could do. After going through my pet insurance policy I realized I had chiropractic coverage. I know how much Chiropractic care has helped me so I wanted to give it a go for Piper. After the first adjustment she immediately started doing zoomies around my living room & showing off her "play" skills to Dr. Kristen. Plus no more limping. After several visits I have been able to take her off the arthritis meds & we have not seen a limp again. I will continue using Sonoran Animal Chiropractic to keep my old girl comfortable & happy. 10/10

Kristen has been a godsend to our family. Our boxer was diagnosed with Valley fever & wasn't able to walk on her back leg which made her entire body out of whack. We have had 4 adjustments with Kristen and our boxer has been doing AMAZING & even started walking on all 4 legs after 1st adjustment. Any time we have any concerns Kristen gets back to us immediately & fits you in quickly if needed. Would absolutely recommend her to anyone who has animals. Best part is she comes to your home so no loading up your pets & taking them to an office if you have animals that get scared like mine does.
