# The Feline Finders - Lost Cat Recovery Specialist - Nationwide

(3 reviews)

Verified Member since Mar 2017 

I'm a certified Missing Animal Response Technician and Pet Detective. I am certified through the Missing Animal Response organization and Missing Animal Response Network. I specialize in finding lost and missing cats. I have three search/trailing dogs that I employ when I do an on-site search and investigation. I offer consultation services and I will travel 600 miles from Little Rock, AR with my search/trailing dogs to conduct on-site searches.

I look forward to helping you find your lost kitty.
