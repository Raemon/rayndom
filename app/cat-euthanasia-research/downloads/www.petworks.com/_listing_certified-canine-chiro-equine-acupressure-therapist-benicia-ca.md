Verified Member since Jan 2025 

With over 25 years of experience as a holistic animal therapist, I am dedicated to enhancing the well-being of your beloved companions through expert canine and equine acupressure, nutrition guidance, and specialized cranial and spinal care. As a Licensed Chiropractor and Angel's Animals Certified practitioner, I provide highly effective therapies tailored to dogs, cats, horses, goats, and birds. My practice is anchored in Benicia, California, where I offer personalized, house-call services within the region, ensuring your pets receive the utmost care in the comfort of their own home.

My credentials extend beyond physical healing, as I am also a Board Certified Grief and Bereavement Counselor through the American Academy of Grief Counseling. I am passionate about supporting pet parents through their journey of loss, offering compassionate guidance and counseling. My international expertise, gained from practicing in countries like Australia, India, Singapore, and Japan, enriches my approach, allowing me to blend diverse techniques and insights into each session. Whether your pet is under 20 lbs or over 80 lbs, my flexible and comprehensive services are designed to meet their unique needs.
