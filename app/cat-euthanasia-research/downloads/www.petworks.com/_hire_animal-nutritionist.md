**Animal Nutritionist for Dogs & Cats - Online Consultations**

**What Does an Animal Nutritionist Do?**

An animal nutritionist evaluates your pet’s unique nutritional needs and builds a custom meal plan to promote optimal health for dogs and cats. They review medical history, activity levels, food preferences, allergies, and chronic conditions to ensure your pet gets the right balance of proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals. 

Nutritionists may recommend commercial diets, high-quality kibble, raw or cooked diets, supplements, or feeding strategies to support digestion, weight control, skin/coat health, and immune function. 

**Benefits of Hiring an Animal Nutritionist**

Personalized nutrition: Tailored diet plans for your dog or cat’s individual health needs. 

Improved digestion & energy: Balanced meals lead to more vitality. 

Weight management: Ideal for pets that are overweight, underweight, or need special diets. 

Chronic condition support: Helps manage allergies, GI problems, diabetes, and more. 

Long-term wellness: A science-backed diet enhances overall quality of life. 

**Typical Animal Nutrition Consultation Costs in 2026**

Initial consultation: ~$75–$200 per session 

Follow-up sessions: ~$50–$150 per visit 

Personalized nutrition plan: ~$150–$400+ depending on complexity 

Ongoing support packages: Costs increase with deeper support or multiple follow-ups 

These ranges cover services for both dogs and cats, whether in-person or virtual. 

**Nutrition Certifications & Qualifications to Look For**

Accredited training: Credentials in animal nutrition, veterinary nutrition, or related animal science fields. 

Continuing education: Staying current with the latest research in pet health and diet. 

Experience with dogs and cats: Nutrition needs vary by species, so choose someone familiar with both. 

Collaborative communication: Works with your veterinarian to align dietary plans with medical needs. 

**Experience & Professional Credentials**

PetWorks animal nutritionists bring years of hands-on experience 🐾 - often 8 to 20+ years working with dogs, cats, and other pets to improve their health through balanced, science-based nutrition. They specialize in creating diet plans tailored to your pet’s age, weight, breed, activity level, and medical needs. 

PetWorks professionals hold advanced credentials, including board certification from the American College of Veterinary Nutrition (ACVN) 🎓 and membership in the Academy of Veterinary Nutrition Technicians (AVNT) 🧠, reflecting their expertise in assessing nutritional requirements and designing effective meal plans. 

**Animal Nutritionist FAQs**

**1\. What can a pet nutritionist help with?**

They help with customized diet plans, weight issues, allergies, digestive concerns, chronic disease support, and overall nutritional wellness. 

**2\. How is a pet nutritionist different from a veterinarian?**

Veterinarians diagnose and treat health conditions; nutritionists specialize in diet formulation and long-term nutrition support, often in collaboration with vets. 

**3\. Do I need a nutritionist if my vet already gives diet advice?**

A vet may provide general feeding guidelines, but a nutritionist can create a detailed, individualized plan for your dog or cat. 

**4\. Can an animal nutritionist help pets with medical conditions?**

Yes, especially for conditions influenced by diet such as obesity, GI sensitivities, allergies, and chronic issues. 

**5\. How long does it take to see results?**

Results vary, but many owners notice improvements in energy, digestion, or weight within weeks of following a nutritionist’s plan. 

**6\. Are virtual nutrition consultations effective?**

Yes! They offer convenience and expert guidance, especially for dietary planning and follow-up support. 

**7\. What should I prepare before a session?**

Bring your pet’s medical history, current food list, behavior notes, allergies, and weight trends to help the nutritionist tailor the best plan. 

**Dr. Marty**

In 2021, Dr. Marty Goldstein joined PetWorks as an advisor in our Animal Nutrition care division. Dr. Marty's animal nutrition expertise and guidance has helped PetWorks become the preeminent animal and pet nutrition consultation service for pet parents throughout North America.
