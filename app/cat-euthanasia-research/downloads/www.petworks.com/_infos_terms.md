**INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS**

Petworks operates as a marketplace platform connecting pet parents with independent pet care professionals. All pet care professionals offering services through Petworks are independent contractors and are not employees, agents, or representatives of Petworks LLC. Petworks does not control the manner, means, or methods by which services are performed.

Pet care professionals are solely responsible for maintaining and accurately representing their qualifications, including licenses, certifications, associations, or other credentials. While Petworks may provide tools or guidance for displaying professional information, it does not independently verify all such credentials. Pet parents should exercise their own judgment when selecting a professional.

By using the Petworks platform, you acknowledge and agree that Petworks is not responsible for the actions, omissions, or performance of any independent pet care professional.

## FEES

We, Petworks, are committed to providing a transparent and fair platform for all our users. In order to maintain the quality of our Service and continue offering valuable features, we charge fees for certain transactions and services. These fees are essential to support our operations and the community as a whole.

  


**1**. Booking Fees for Pet Professionals

Pet professionals who offer their services through our platform are required to pay a booking fee of typically 15% of the total transaction value for each completed booking. This fee is deducted automatically from the earnings of the pet professional and helps us sustain the platform and provide support to our community of pet professionals.   


  


**2**. Service Fees for Pet Parents 

Pet parents who utilize our platform to book services for their pets are subject to a service fee of 10% of the total transaction value for each completed booking. This fee is added to the total cost of the booking and contributes to the continued development and improvement of our platform.  


  


Users are strictly prohibited from attempting to circumvent or avoid the fees associated with using Petworks. Fee circumvention includes, but is not limited to:

  


a. Encouraging or instructing other users to avoid paying applicable fees. 

b. Initiating transactions off-platform to avoid fees for transactions that should occur on Petworks. 

c. Providing misleading or false information to manipulate the fee calculation process. 

d. Prior to the initiation of a booking, providing a Petworks pet parent with your external contact information, such as a phone number, website URL, email address, or social media page. 

e. Any other actions that are deemed by Petworks as an attempt to evade legitimate fees.

Any user found to be in violation of this policy by attempting to circumvent Petworks fees will be subject to appropriate consequences, which may include:

a. Immediate removal of access to the platform and termination of the user's account. 

b. Suspension of account privileges for a designated period. 

c. Reversal of any transactions associated with the fee circumvention. 

**3**. Bookings transacted outside of the Petworks platform are strictly prohibited. When a booking is transacted/paid-for outside of the Petworks platform, Petworks cannot guarantee recovery of any external funds exchanged between pet parents and pet pros. All bookings are to be transacted and paid-for, in full, on the Petworks platform.

**REVIEWS**

Reviews should be unbiased. Members of the Petworks community may not coerce, intimidate, extort, threaten, incentivize or manipulate another person in an attempt to influence a review, like promising compensation or receiving compensation in exchange for a positive review or threatening consequences in the event of a negative review.

Reviews may not be provided or withheld in exchange for something of value, like a discount, refund, reciprocal review, or promise not to take negative action against the reviewer. They also may not be used as an attempt to mislead or deceive Petworks, or another person.

Nonetheless, any reviews which violate our stated guidelines can and will be removed at Petworks' discretion.
