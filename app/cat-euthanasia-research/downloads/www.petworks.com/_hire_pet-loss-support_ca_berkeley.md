**How can a pet loss support counselor help me through my grief?**

Losing a pet is an emotionally devastating experience, and many pet parents in Berkeley, CA find that friends and family may not fully understand the depth of that loss. A professional pet loss support counselor provides a safe, compassionate space to express grief, process emotions, and begin healing. These specialists are trained to guide clients through the stages of loss, offering personalized strategies to cope with sadness, guilt, or loneliness. Whether your pet recently passed or you’re struggling with anticipatory grief, support can make all the difference. Sessions can be held locally in Berkeley or remotely from the comfort of your home.

**Is it normal to feel so heartbroken after losing a pet?**

Absolutely. In Berkeley, California, and everywhere, pets are cherished members of the family. It’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed by sadness, emptiness, or even anger after their loss. Grief looks different for everyone, and there is no “right” way to mourn. Pet loss support helps validate those feelings and provides tools for moving forward at your own pace. Many people find comfort knowing they are not alone in their experience, and that virtual support sessions are available to connect with a professional. Whether nearby in Berkeley or elsewhere, without needing to leave home.

**How much does pet loss support counseling cost in Berkeley, CA?**

In Berkeley, CA, individual pet loss support sessions typically range from $50 to $125, depending on the counselor’s credentials, session length, and whether the service is local or virtual. Many licensed social workers, grief counselors, or therapists offer sliding scale fees, especially for virtual sessions. Remote appointments are just as personal and effective as in-person visits. And often more accessible for those grieving privately at home. It’s always worth asking if bundled packages or shorter check-in sessions are available to support ongoing healing.

**What are some local towns and cities with pet loss support near me?**

Alameda County, Oakland, San Francisco, Fremont, Hayward, Richmond, Concord, Daly City, San Mateo, Redwood City, Walnut Creek
