# Pets' Request Mobile In Home Pet Euthanasia - Davis, CA

Member since Jul 2020 

One of our most compassionate offerings is end-of-life care, including veterinary hospice and in-home euthanasia. We believe that providing a peaceful and comfortable environment for your pet's final moments is an essential part of our commitment to excellent veterinary care.

At Pets’ Request Mobile Veterinary Services, we understand that pets are cherished family members who deserve exceptional medical care. Recognizing the demands of busy lives, we offer the convenience of bringing veterinary services directly to your home. This eliminates the stress of transporting your pet, whether it's coaxing a cat into a carrier or helping an arthritic dog into the car. Based in Davis, California, we serve Yolo County, Western Sacramento County, and Northern Solano County.

Our comprehensive in-home services for cats and dogs include annual physical exams, routine vaccinations, blood work, parasite screening and prevention, ultrasound, radiography, therapeutic laser treatments, health certificate examinations for travel, and urgent care for when your pet isn’t feeling their best.

While we cannot perform major surgical or dental procedures in a home setting, we will refer you to trusted local animal hospitals if these services are needed. For emergencies, we recommend MarQueen, VISTA, SVRC, SPEC, and the UC Davis Veterinary Teaching Hospital.

Please contact and book us on Petworks. Thank you.
