# Which Dog Temperaments Are Best for Families with Kids?

Choosing a dog for a family isn’t just about picking a cute breed. It’s about temperament. A dog’s temperament determines how they interact with children, handle chaos, and respond to training.

**Dog temperament** refers to a [dog’s natural behavior](https://www.petworks.com/hire/dog-behaviorist/ct/redding), personality, and emotional responses. Unlike temporary moods, temperament is relatively stable and influenced by genetics, early socialization, and training.

### ✅ Expert & Professional Quotes on Dogs, Temperament & Kids

Adding expert insights helps families understand which **dog temperaments** are safe and suitable for households with children. Here are some trusted voices in animal behavior and dog training:

#### [**Patricia McConnell, Ph.D., CAAB — Animal Behaviorist & Author**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_McConnell)

> “Young children and dogs can be the best of friends, or the worst of enemies.… To some dogs, kids can be unpredictable, rude and/or frightening.” – Patricia McConnell

When selecting a **family dog** , McConnell emphasizes that it’s better to focus on **temperament rather than appearance**. A dog’s comfort with children, household noise, and unpredictability matters far more than how cute they look.

> “It’s often better to focus on temperament than appearance — because a dog’s comfort with children, noise, and unpredictability matters more than how cute they look.” – Patricia McConnell

These insights are especially useful when evaluating **dogs for families** , highlighting which temperaments are ideal or may present challenges with kids.

* * *

#### [**Donna Duford — Dog‑and‑Kids Safety & Socialization Expert (via Whole Dog Journal)**](https://www.whole-dog-journal.com/care/kids-and-dogs/)

> “Good qualities for family dogs are high sociability and responsiveness, and low to moderate energy and excitability.” – Whole Dog Journal / Donna Duford

> “Socialization to children is paramount.” – Donna Duford

Duford advises against assuming behavior based solely on breed. Each dog’s **individual temperament** should be evaluated before welcoming them into a home with children. These guidelines are critical for families looking to choose a dog that is patient, social, and child‑friendly.

* * *

#### [**Isabella Rossellini — Ethologist & Long-Term Service‑Dog Volunteer**](https://people.com/actress-animal-behaviorist-isabella-rossellini-dog-tip-8733733)

> “Select for temperament rather than looks.” – Isabella Rossellini

Rossellini underscores a core principle: outward appearance or breed popularity should **never outweigh a dog’s behavioral traits** , particularly when children are part of the household. Choosing based on temperament ensures a **safe and harmonious family environment**.

## Additional Tips for Families Choosing a Dog

**Match Energy Levels:** High-energy dogs suit active families, while calm dogs may be better for households with very young children.

**Supervise Interactions:** Never leave small children alone with a new dog, regardless of temperament.

**Training Is Key:** Even the friendliest dogs need consistent guidance to follow boundaries.

**Socialization Matters:** Early exposure to children, other pets, and household noises helps dogs adjust comfortably.

**Consider Size:** Large dogs can unintentionally knock over toddlers, so size and temperament should both be evaluated.
