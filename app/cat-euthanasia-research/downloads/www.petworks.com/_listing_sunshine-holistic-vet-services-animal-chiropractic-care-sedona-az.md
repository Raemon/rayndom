(4 reviews)

Member since Nov 2020 

As a licensed chiropractor with over 40 years of veterinary experience, I specialize in providing comprehensive holistic care for both cats and dogs. My approach involves a thorough evaluation and detailed history-taking to uncover the root causes of your pet's health issues. I believe that every pet deserves individualized attention, and I take my time during each consultation to ensure that no detail is overlooked. With 20 years dedicated to holistic medicine, I combine traditional techniques with innovative therapies, including acupuncture, chiropractic adjustments, herbal remedies, and tailored diet recommendations.

I am proud to offer mobile services that bring exceptional care directly to your home, making it convenient for you and your furry companions. My practice is fully insured and licensed, ensuring that you can trust in the quality and safety of the treatments I provide. Whether your pet falls under 20 lbs or over 80 lbs, I have the expertise to address their unique needs, allowing me to serve a wide range of sizes and breeds. I also offer online consultations for those who prefer virtual sessions, making holistic care accessible no matter where you are.

Ready to enhance your pet's health and well-being with a holistic approach? I invite you to book a session through Petworks today! Your pet deserves the best care, and I am here to provide it with compassion and expertise. Let’s work together to help your furry friend thrive!

## Customer Reviews

Dr. Todd has singlehandedly helped with my dog's idiopathic epilepsy. My pup hasn't had a seizure in 10 months, thanks to the nutritional and supplemental guidance from Dr. Todd. We are happily dosing with CBD, Chinese herbs, trace minerals, and nutrients that combat seizure activity. We changed our dog's diet based on his recommendations. We had acupuncture done by him as well. I would highly refer Dr. Todd to anyone seeking alternative treatments for their animals. His compassion and magical touch has worked wonders for our Border Terrier, thank you!

Dr. Metcalf has been treating our small dog for several years -- she has thrived under his care. His holistic approach includes diagnosis, acupuncture, chiropractic, herbal supplements, and wholesome diet. His gentle care and loving support for our elderly dog has added joy and years. We can't recommend Dr. Metcalf more enthusiastically!!

Dr Metcalf brings his services and resources and the healing atmosphere of spirituality to your home to treat your four legged fur kids. Our lab/shepherd has been diagnosed with the fatal neurodegenerative myelopathy. She is a rescue with the most precious personality you will ever meet and we hope to extend her life as long as her life is one of good quality. Dr Metcalf’s acupuncture and Chinese herb treatment is already making a difference preserving Sadie’s ability to walk and we feel so fortunate to have found him.

I was desperate to help my senior beagle find relief from his mobility issues. A woman at the dog park recommended Dr. Todd, whose acupuncture, laser treatments and herbal supplements helped my dear, sweet Eli immensely. I highly recommend his services.
