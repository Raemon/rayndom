# Whisperer of the Animals - Animal Communicator - Nationwide

Verified Member since Oct 2021 

Whisperer of the Animals offers so much more than just Animal Communication. Teri Ann is a Certified Animal Energy Practitioner, a Certified Trauma-Informed Horse Trainer and has been communicating with Animals since she was a girl. 

She also teaches Human * Equine * Pet CPR & First Aid Training throughout AZ. 

Teri Ann is not your average chitty-chatty animal communicator. She gets down to the nitty-gritty issues by working with your animal on their Physical, Mental, Emotional and Spiritual levels.

I offer in-person sessions throughout Maricopa County and long-distance sessions as well.

I offer the following services:

Animal Communication 

Animal Reiki

Animal Light Therapy 

Energy & Body Works 

Energy Tracking 

Reducing Fears & Trauma in Animals 

Teri Ann begins with a phone or Zoom session to understand your pet's needs.

Teri Ann has guided several lost animals home as well as guiding animals into traps for recovery

I have over 40 years of field experience working with animals. I also hold several Certifications, including Animal Energy Practitioner & Trauma-Informed Horse Trainer, among others. I believe in continuing her education in the animal world and believes that you are never too old to learn something new.

I also volunteer with rescues and Maricopa Animal Control & Care

Please contact and book me on Petworks. Have an amazing day!
