**Pet Transportation Services**

**Average Pet Transport Costs in 2026. Pet transport pricing depends on distance, mode, and service level:**

Local ground transport: $100–$350 

Long-distance ground transport: $350–$1,200+ 

Shared ground rides: $0.50–$1.00 per mile 

Private ground rides: $1.00–$3.00 per mile 

Flight nanny services (domestic): $500–$1,500 

Air cargo transport: $300–$1,200 (depends on pet size & carrier fees) 

International pet relocation: $1,500–$5,000+ (includes permits, customs, and airline fees) 

These ranges reflect typical 2026 costs for dog transport, cat transport, and other pet shipping services. 

**Essential Certifications & Licensing**

Ensure your pet transport provider is qualified: 

USDA APHIS Registration: Required for interstate & international travel. 

State & Local Licensing: Business and vehicle permits for ground transport. 

Professional Training: Pet first aid/CPR experience; handling anxious, senior, or medical-needs pets. 

Insurance & Bonding: Liability insurance protects pets and owners. 

Vet Documents & Travel Requirements 

Health Certificate (CVI): Issued by a licensed vet within 10 days of travel. 

Vaccination Records: Up-to-date rabies and core shots. 

Microchip Information: ISO-compliant microchips often required for international travel. 

International Permits: Import permits, customs clearance, or quarantine documents may be necessary. 

**Safety & Comfort Tips**

Crate Standards: Use IATA-approved crates that allow pets to stand, turn, and lie down comfortably. 

Climate Control: Vehicles must be ventilated and temperature-regulated. 

Breaks & Monitoring: Frequent water, potty breaks, and comfort checks. 

Familiar Items: Bring a blanket, toy, or familiar object to reduce stress. 

Booking Tips & Red Flags 

✅ Request a detailed quote covering pickup, stops, overnight care, vet paperwork, and airline fees. 

✅ Ask for trip updates — GPS tracking or scheduled check-ins. 

❌ Avoid upfront payments without contracts — verify USDA registration, licensing, and reviews first.
