# Pet Nutrition Doctor- Telehealth Holistic Health Consulting - Nationwide

(10 reviews)

Verified Member since Aug 2020 

All consults are done virtually, so you can be anywhere in the United States!

A nutritional consult with me includes full evaluation of all medical records from a holistic standpoint, a 30 minute consult by phone or Zoom and a full summary of recommendations, including sourcing if supplements are recommended. 

The listed fee is for the initial consult only. Follow up consults are $110.

Therapies offered include individualized diet formulation, specific nutritional and herbal supplement recommendations, at home light therapy treatments and educational courses for deeper dive understanding of how food affects health is every way. There is also the opportunity for specific diagnostic testing that you can do from the comfort of your home. 

As a veterinarian with over 35 years of clinical experience specializing in nutrition, digestive health and immune system function using the holistic approach, I will be interpreting your pet’s health through a different lens than your traditional veterinarian.

While traditional medicine excels in many areas, it teaches us to separate parts and treat symptoms.   
A holistic veterinarian focuses on how things are connected, always looking for a root cause that frequently addresses multiple symptoms as the body heals. 

When needed, I can also create a fully balanced, whole food, species appropriate individualized diet formulation for those pets with significant disease or multiple food intolerances. 

I help pet owners choose foods and supplements that support the health of pets, people and planet.   
Our pets suffer from many of the same chronic illness that we do. That is not surprising when you realize that according to the Center of Disease Control (CDC), 70-90% of chronic illness is due to diet and lifestyle. 

That means that we have CONTROL once we have the correct information. We can reverse many chronic illnesses including obesity, diabetes and even cancer when we change how we live and what we put into our bodies. I can help you make the best choices for your furry family member.

I also believe that until we heal the Earth, none of us will truly be healthy. So every choice I make for diets, herbs and supplements considers the impact on the Earth as well.

#### How did you hone your craft?

Education: Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) - Purdue University School of Veterinary Medicine ; After healing myself of the effects of 2 autoimmune diseases using only food and nutritional supplements, I then had the opportunity to use what I had learned on my own cat when she developed pancreatitis and severe inflammatory bowel disease. I realized that the food choices had to be based on species appropriate choices. When she responded so well to this approach, I knew I had to use the same approach on my patients. So many who had failed traditional treatments responded well to my approach.

#### What tip would you give pet parents for working with animals that you've learned as a pro?

Our dogs and cats are not little humans. They need to be fed as the little carnivores that they are. When we work WITH their nature instead of trying to fight it, we gain so much more!

#### What is one thing you want pet parents to know about you? It can be whatev-fur you'd like!

In addition to helping you heal your pets, I am passionate about helping to heal the Earth. I recognize how we are all connected to this planet and our health depends on hers. All product and supplement recommendations are made with your pet's health in mind first, but always considering the impact on our planet. This means caring for the soil microbiome as we care for the gut microbiome, ensuring that products recommended have minimal negative, and hopefully positive, environmental impact and teaching you ways to clean up your local environment to help clean up our collective environment.
