# 5 Tips For Walking Your Dog In The Winter

Winter doesn’t have to put your dog’s daily walks on pause. In fact, regular winter walks are essential for maintaining your dog’s physical health, mental stimulation, and overall happiness. Even when temperatures drop and sidewalks get slick. With the right preparation and a few smart adjustments, cold-weather walks can be safe, enjoyable, and beneficial for both you and your pup.

Below are **five practical, vet-approved tips for walking your dog in the winter** , followed by a helpful FAQ section to answer common cold-weather concerns.

## 1\. Dress Your Dog (and Yourself) for Winter Conditions

Not all dogs are built for cold weather. While breeds like Huskies and Malamutes thrive in low temperatures, short-haired, small, senior, and toy breeds can struggle in winter conditions.

**How to protect your dog from the cold:**

  * **Dog coats or sweaters:** Insulated, water-resistant jackets help retain body heat, especially for short-haired breeds.

  * **Booties or paw wax:** These protect paws from ice, snow, and chemical deicers.

  * **Proper fit:** Clothing should be snug but not restrictive—avoid chafing around legs and neck.




Don’t forget about yourself. Wearing weather-appropriate shoes with good traction helps prevent slips, keeping both you and your dog safe.

> **Expert insight:**  
> _“If it’s too cold for you to comfortably stand outside without gloves, it’s likely too cold for many dogs to be outside for extended periods,”_ says [**Dr. Marty Becker, DVM**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drmartybecker/) , a nationally recognized veterinarian and founder of Fear Free Pets.

## 2\. Protect Your Dog’s Paws From Ice, Salt, and Chemicals

Winter sidewalks and roads are often treated with salt, ice melt, and chemicals that can irritate or even burn your dog’s paw pads. Ice buildup between toes can also cause cracking and discomfort.

### Paw protection best practices:

  * Use **dog booties** for maximum protection.

  * Apply **paw balm or wax** before walks to create a protective barrier.

  * After each walk, **wipe paws with a damp cloth** to [remove salt and chemicals](https://www.animalhumanesociety.org/resource/protect-your-dogs-paws-winter-weather).

  * Trim fur between paw pads to prevent snow clumps.




Watch for excessive licking or limping after walks—both can be signs of paw irritation.

* * *

## 3\. Adjust Walk Length and Timing

Winter walks don’t need to be long to be effective. Cold air, wind chill, and icy conditions can make extended outings uncomfortable or unsafe.

### Smart winter walking strategies:

  * Opt for **shorter, more frequent walks** instead of one long walk.

  * Walk during the **warmest part of the day** , usually late morning or early afternoon.

  * Avoid early morning or nighttime walks when ice is hardest to see.

  * Stick to **cleared sidewalks and familiar routes**.




Remember: exercise is important, but safety always comes first. When [hiring a professional dog walker](https://www.petworks.com/hire/dog-walking), always ask about safety precautions, particularly during cold dark winter days and evenings.

## 4\. Be Visible and Stay Alert

Winter brings shorter days, reduced visibility, and slippery surfaces. Taking precautions can significantly reduce the risk of accidents.

### Winter visibility tips:

  * Use **reflective leashes, collars, or harnesses**.

  * Attach **LED safety lights** to your dog’s collar.

  * Wear reflective or light-colored outerwear yourself.

  * Walk against traffic when possible and stay alert near intersections.




Also pay close attention to your dog’s behavior. Shivering, slowing down, lifting paws, or refusing to walk are signs it’s time to head home.

## 5\. Keep Your Dog Engaged and Comfortable After Walks

Winter walks can be mentally stimulating, but they also require recovery time—especially in cold conditions.

### Post-walk care tips:

  * Dry your dog thoroughly, paying attention to paws, belly, and ears.

  * Check for cracked paw pads or redness.

  * Offer fresh water—dogs can become dehydrated in cold weather too.

  * Follow walks with indoor enrichment like puzzle toys or light training sessions.




> **Kevin Kinyon, pet care expert and Co-Founder of PetWorks, shares:**  
> _“Winter walks aren’t just about physical exercise. They’re about maintaining routine and mental well-being. Even short outdoor walks, paired with indoor enrichment, can make a huge difference in your dog’s mood during colder months.”_

* * *

## Bonus Tip: Know When It’s Too Cold to Walk

As a general guideline:

  * **Below 32°F (0°C):** Monitor closely, especially for small or short-haired dogs.

  * **Below 20°F (-6°C):** Limit walks to brief bathroom breaks.

  * **Below 0°F (-18°C):** Most dogs should stay indoors except for very short outings.




Always factor in wind chill, moisture, and your dog’s age, size, and health.

* * *

### **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**

### How cold is too cold to walk my dog?

It depends on your dog’s breed, size, coat, and health. Small, senior, and short-haired dogs may struggle below 32°F, while cold-weather breeds can tolerate much lower temperatures. When in doubt, keep walks short.

### Do dogs really need coats in the winter?

Many do. Dogs with thin coats, low body fat, or medical conditions benefit greatly from insulated jackets during winter walks.

### Are dog boots necessary?

They’re not mandatory, but they’re highly recommended in icy or salted areas. Boots prevent paw injuries, chemical burns, and ice buildup.

### Can winter walks replace indoor exercise?

Winter walks are important, but they should be supplemented with indoor play, training, and enrichment—especially when outdoor time is limited by weather.

### What should I do if my dog refuses to walk in the cold?

Don’t force it. Try shorter walks, protective gear, or indoor activities like fetch, tug, or nose work. Some dogs simply dislike cold weather. And that’s okay.

## Final Thoughts

Walking your dog in the winter doesn’t have to be stressful or risky. With proper preparation, awareness, and flexibility, winter walks can remain a healthy and enjoyable part of your dog’s routine. Focus on comfort, safety, and engagement, and you’ll both get through the colder months happier—and healthier.

Whether it’s a brisk neighborhood stroll or a quick potty break, every step counts. 🐾
