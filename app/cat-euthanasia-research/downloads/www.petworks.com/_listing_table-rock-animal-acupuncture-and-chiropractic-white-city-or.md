# Table Rock Animal Acupuncture and Chiropractic - White City, OR

Member since Oct 2020 

At Table Rock Animal Acupuncture, I, Dr. Tristin Morgan, DVM, CVA, and CIVCA, am passionate about providing comprehensive integrative medicine to a vast array of species, including dogs, cats, birds, reptiles, and even exotic pets like chinchillas and hedgehogs. With over three years of experience in the field, my expertise encompasses traditional Eastern Medicine, acupuncture, chiropractic adjustments, and herbal medicine, tailored to meet the unique needs of each animal. I have honed my skills and knowledge through rigorous training, earning my CVA from Chi University and my CIVCA certification from Options for Animals and the International Veterinary Chiropractic Association (IVCA).

I offer small animal acupuncture and chiropractic services at various veterinary offices throughout Southern Oregon, ensuring that your furry friends receive the best care possible. For larger animals, including horses and goats, I provide mobile services right at your location, making it convenient for you and your pets. My holistic approach not only addresses physical ailments but also promotes overall well-being and longevity. Whether your pet requires routine maintenance or specialized treatment, I am dedicated to enhancing their quality of life through my integrative techniques.

Ready to explore the benefits of integrative veterinary care for your beloved pets? Let’s work together to promote their health and happiness! I invite you to book an appointment through Petworks today and experience the compassionate care that only a certified professional can provide. Don’t wait; your pets deserve the best!
