# Pet Parent Tutorial – How To Book

Welcome Pet Parents! You’re here because you need to book trusted pet care services for your beloved animals. Below is a step-by-step tutorial which explains exactly how the booking process works, from soup to nuts:

**Step 1:** Go to [Petworks](https://www.petworks.com/) and search for the pet care service you need. We also offer additional pet care services on our “[More](https://www.petworks.com/more-pet-care)” page.

**Step 2:** Once you’ve clicked on a pet care category, you’ll next see search results of pet care pros who you can contact and hire: 

**Step 3:** Choose a pet care service pro by clicking on her tile. Then you’ll view her full listing page. And if you’d like to book, then click on the “Book Now” button:

**Step 4:** On the next page, choose the pricing package you’d like, by clicking the corresponding “Add” button. Then further down the page, you can enter your payment information, write a short message to the pet care pro, and click on the “Submit Payment” button. **Note:** you will not be charged until the pet pro you’ve chosen has accepted your booking offer:

**Step 5** : Petworks will send your booking offer to the pet pro. If and when the pet pro accepts your offer, your card will be charged. _**Most pros will accept booking offers in less than one hour.**_ Petworks will then immediately initiate the payment transfer to the pro you’ve booked. The pro will receive your payment within two business days.

**Step 6:** Then in your Petworks Inbox, you can meet with your pet care professional and discuss specifics. The pro may ask you to provide additional information about your pet as well. You’ll be able to exchange contact information, share important files, and converse as much as you need to. Ultimately, you and the pet care professional you’ve booked, will together schedule the day/time/location (in-person or virtual) of your session.

**Step 7:** Have a great pet care service session!
