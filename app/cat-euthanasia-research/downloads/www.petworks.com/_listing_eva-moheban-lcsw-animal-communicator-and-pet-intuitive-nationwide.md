# Eva Moheban, LCSW - Animal Communicator and Pet Intuitive - Nationwide

Verified Member since Jun 2022 

Hello! I have over 10 years of direct clinical experience as a trauma-informed, licensed clinical social worker (LCSW). I am certified in animal communication and have found it to be a calling that natural blends my therapy experience with deeper spiritual work. My combination of intuitive gifts, spiritual wisdom, and therapeutic skills will help you connect with your animal friend/furbaby on a deeper level. I specialize in working with grief/loss, trauma/PTSD, life transitions, and highly advanced/spiritual animals. I work well with animals who are struggling to get a message to their people and who may be ready to transition to the other side.

If your animal friend/furbaby has recently passed, I can help you make more peace with the loss, aid in closure/ceremonial processes, and can also use talk therapy to provide a safe space as you heal from your loss. I would love to help you process the complex, truly painful, grief and loss you are experiencing. I have been through it and can support you from both a personal and professional standpoint. 

If you are within an approximate 20-minute driving radius, I can make house calls for an additional fee, as well. I can also provide a free 10 minute phone conversation to ensure it’s a good fit before getting started. I can then explain more about myself/my specialities and learn more about your particular needs. Please contact and book me through Petworks to set up an initial evaluation session. Thank you so much.

#### What tip would you give pet parents for working with animals that you've learned as a pro?

Animals are our mirrors, and they're emotional sponges, too! If there is something ailing your animal, it’s a good idea to go inward to find out what they could be picking up from you/your pain or trauma. They want you to be happy and can feel when you are not, which can confuse or sadden them. I recommend that all pet parents must heal from their own trauma and blockages, as our animals are deeply effected by our blind spots and barriers. 

#### What is one thing you want pet parents to know about you? It can be whatev-fur you'd like!

I love getting to know new people and animals and being outdoors in nature. I love animals, nature walks, vegan cooking/eating, writing, and serving all types of beings.
