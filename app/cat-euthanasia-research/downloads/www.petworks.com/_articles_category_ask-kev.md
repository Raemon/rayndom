# Help! My Dog’s Got a Morning Grass Smoothie Habit

### **Dear Kev** –

“I have a two-year-old Golden Retriever with a delicate morning routine that includes grass nibbling, a touch of vomiting (on an empty stomach), and the occasional breakfast boycott. So yeah, my dog eats grass. The vet suspects excess stomach acid and prescribed Prilosec…but I’ve read dogs need stomach acid to digest food properly, and suppressing it long term might not be the best idea. Is there a gentler, more holistic fix? Or do I just need to accept that my dog’s trying to become a lawn care technician?” – Jenni, Little Rock, Arkansas

### **Hi Jenni** –

Ah yes. The infamous “empty tummy barfies,” followed by a gourmet grass garnish. Classic canine.

What you’re describing is actually pretty common, especially in younger, active dogs. When pups go too long without food, their stomachs can overproduce acid, which leads to nausea, grass cravings (which act as nature’s Tums), and sometimes a foamy yellow throw-up encore. Not exactly the breakfast-of-champions routine we hope for.

Now, your vet wasn’t wrong to try [Prilosec](https://prilosecotc.com/en-us). It’s a standard first-line approach to curb acid production. But your gut (pun fully intended) is spot on too. Dogs _do_ need stomach acid to break down food and absorb nutrients. Too much suppression over time? Not ideal. We’re aiming for  _balance_ , not an acid-free environment fit for a goldfish.

### **Here are a few gentler steps to try before going full pharmacy:**

  1. **Late-night snack:** Add a small protein-rich bedtime treat. Boiled chicken, a spoonful of cottage cheese, or even a dab of plain pumpkin on a cracker. It keeps her tummy busy overnight so it’s not brewing acid like a mad scientist at dawn.
  2. **Split her meals:** Feeding two smaller meals (morning and evening) is great, but some acid-sensitive dogs do better with three. Try adding a mid-day or pre-bedtime mini-meal.
  3. **Slippery elm or marshmallow root:** These natural herbs can help coat and soothe the digestive tract. They’re like a botanical hug for your pup’s belly. But always check with a holistic vet or [pup dietician](https://www.petworks.com/hire/dog-nutritionist) before adding supplements.
  4. **Keep a log:** Track when the grass-chomping and vomiting happen, before walks, on an empty stomach, after stress? Patterns = clues.



If these tweaks help, great. You may not need acid blockers long term. But if symptoms persist or worsen, your vet might want to rule out things like bile reflux, gastritis, or even food sensitivities (yes, dogs can be gluten-free hipsters too).

### **So Your Dog Eats Grass With Her Coffee…**

Most importantly, don’t beat yourself up for asking questions or wanting a more natural approach. You’re being a  _brilliant_ advocate for your golden girl. She’s lucky to have you… and the lawn? Well, it might need to file for emotional compensation.

Give that golden a belly rub from me.

# Help! Neighbor’s Barking Dog Is Giving Me Fence-Line Frustrations!

### **Dear Kev –**

“I’m hoping you might have some advice about a barking issue with my neighbor’s dog. Every time their German Shepherd is let outside, he immediately starts barking, and doesn’t stop. It can be 5 a.m., the middle of the day, or late at night. Rain or shine, it’s non-stop as soon as he steps out. Our houses are pretty close together, and when he’s in the backyard, he can see straight into a couple of our windows. Any movement inside seems to set him off even more. We have a dog too. Pete, our 5-year-old Golden Retriever. He’s calm, gentle, and thankfully doesn’t bark back. He mostly just watches in silence, although he once did try to pee on the neighbor’s dog through the fence. I’m not saying I condone it… but I understood the sentiment.

The neighbors themselves are very kind, and their dog knows us and our family. I used to say hello to him regularly, hoping some familiarity would help reduce the barking, but unfortunately, it hasn’t made a difference. My husband doesn’t find it as disruptive, but I work from home, and the barking has really started to affect my concentration and sleep. I’m not trying to start any issues with the neighbors. We like them. I’m just looking for a peaceful solution. Is there anything I can put on the fence, or any other method you’d recommend, to help reduce the barking?” – Monica from Seattle, Washington.

### **Hi Monica –**

Thanks for writing in…and please give Pete a pat on the head for being such a mellow gentleman. Golden Retrievers don’t always get credit for their restraint, but it sounds like he’s handling the situation with quiet dignity (and the occasional strategic fence protest).

What you’re describing with your neighbor’s German Shepherd is actually pretty common, especially in high-alert breeds. [Shepherds are natural protectors](https://harrisonk9.com/family-protection/), and when they’re left outside with visual access to windows, yards, or passing squirrels, they often feel like it’s their job to sound the alarm. It’s not aggression. It’s overstimulation.

Here are a few approaches that can help calm the chaos, without putting stress on your neighborly relationship:

**1\. Block the Visual Triggers**  
Since a lot of the barking seems to happen when he sees movement through your windows, try installing a privacy barrier on your side of the fence. Options include weatherproof outdoor fabric, reed fencing, or tall planters with dense greenery. Even a partial visual block can help reduce his sense of needing to “respond” to what’s happening on your side.

**2\. White Noise or Window Coverings**  
Inside your home, consider using sheer curtains or white noise machines, especially in rooms where the dog has a line of sight. This can help mute both the visuals and the sound, giving you some peace during the day (and early mornings).

**3\. Consider a Friendly Conversation**  
It sounds like you already have a good rapport with your neighbors, which is great. A gentle, honest conversation might go a long way. Something like, “We totally understand he’s a protective pup, but we’re having a hard time with the barking, especially early in the morning. Do you think there’s anything we could try together to help ease things for everyone?”

This keeps things constructive and shows you’re open to solutions, not complaints.

**4\. Dog-Safe Deterrents**  
Some people find success with motion-activated devices, like ultrasonic deterrents or sprinklers. These give dogs a gentle, unexpected cue to pause. If you go this route, make sure anything you use is humane, non-harmful, and won’t agitate your own dog Pete in the process.

In the long run, the barking may not stop entirely, but with the right environmental changes, or even a [canine behavior specialist](https://www.petworks.com/hire/dog-behaviorist), you can likely reduce the frequency and intensity. And with Pete setting a great example, who knows. Maybe the neighbor’s dog will start taking a few notes.

Hang in there, Monica. You’re not alone in this. And you’re handling it with care and patience, which already makes a big difference.

Have a [Peet’s Coffee](https://www.peets.com/) on me!

# Help! My Dog Has Stopped Eating – What Do I Do?

### Dear Kevin,

“My dog went for three days without eating. Then she ate the fourth day. It’s now day five, and she isn’t eating again…not even treats. My dog has stopped eating. What should I do?” – Wanda, Columbia, South Carolina.

### Hi Wanda,

A dog refusing food for several days, especially when it’s inconsistent like this, is a serious concern. Here’s what you should do ASAP:

### **Contact Your Veterinarian Right Away**

Loss of appetite for more than 24 hours in dogs can indicate illness, pain, or a more serious underlying medical issue. Because your dog has now gone several days with little or no food, she/he could be at risk for dehydration, liver problems, or other complications, especially if she/he is a small breed or senior.

### **Monitor for Other Symptoms**

Tell the vet if you notice any of the following:

  * Vomiting or diarrhea
  * Lethargy or weakness
  * Shivering or whining (possible sign of pain)
  * Pale gums
  * Labored breathing
  * Sudden weight loss
  * Refusing water



### **Possible Causes (Your Vet Will Help Diagnose)**

  * Infections (like gastrointestinal infections)
  * Kidney or liver disease
  * Pancreatitis
  * Foreign object ingestion
  * Dental pain
  * Stress or anxiety
  * Medications or recent vaccinations



### **Please Do Not Wait and See**

The “on and off” eating pattern can mean your dog is trying to eat but something is making it painful or nauseating. Dogs can  _**go downhill quickly**_ when not eating. You and your dog are in our thoughts.

_**Follow Up: “She began eating again yesterday and has been drinking lots of water. She drank a lot of water even when she didn’t eat. Thank you for your response. ” – Wanda**_

# Seeking Solutions: My Senior Cat’s Ongoing Litter Box Issues!

### **Dear Kevin,**

My male cat Remy pees and/or poops outside the litter box persistently. I adopted him from a shelter where he was housed for only 1 day. He was 10 months old and apparently had been in a home in a bad neighborhood, had been tuned out, and had slightly burned fur in spots. The first night in my home, at 2:00 am he peed in the middle of my bed. He continued this for 3 or 4 nights until the vet helped me stop this. It started again about a year later on the tunnel toy I got for both him and a female playmate I adopted for him who love each other. I had to get rid of the tunnel toy, but he continued to pee on the hall rug where it had been. He stopped for a few years but in the past two years has started again…now on my bed. I live in fear and dread never knowing when it will happen. Sometimes I ignored it and just cleaned up. Sometimes I would pick him up, rub his nose in it and then in the litter box, but nothing stops him. He seems to be unaware of doing anything wrong. The litter box is extremely clean, very large and in the bathroom in my small apartment quite close to everywhere.

#### I love him so much…

It breaks my heart to give him away, knowing someone else might turn him out and eventually he would be euthanized. And his sister Cherie loves him much. I cuddle him, caress him, feed him well and give him much affection. It will happen sometimes even after much loving too. But mostly it just happens! Long ago I realized his motto seems to be: “I want what I want when I want it.” He will be 11 years in August. I will be 90 in September. I don’t want to live with this situation much longer and know I have to do something soon. And I don’t want to live with ‘cat boarders’ as I love to show them love and treat them like my children. I have had 4 previous cats who were angels, whom I loved very much with never a problem. I am writing because I am hoping that your organization will screen someone and put me in touch with a cat communicator who is aware of the situation and will have a handle on it. I do not want to waste time and money. I live in an apartment in New York City. My cats are indoors. Looking forward to hearing from you! Sincerely, Ruth

### **Hi Ruth –**

Thank you for writing to us and sharing your heartfelt story about Remy. It’s clear you have given this cat your whole heart, and you’ve gone above and beyond to care for him despite the challenges. Your patience, love, and devotion – are deeply admirable. You’re not alone, and the fact that you’re still seeking solutions instead of giving up says so much about your compassion.

From what you’ve described, it sounds like Remy’s behavior may be rooted in [unresolved trauma](https://www.petmd.com/dog/behavior/how-heal-emotionally-traumatized-pet) or emotional stress, potentially dating back to his early experiences before adoption. Cats can carry emotional wounds just like people, and those early burns, instability, and fear could still be affecting his sense of security. Even now.

You’ve done everything right: a clean, accessible litter box, affection, attention, a companion cat. The intermittent nature of Remy’s peeing and the stress it causes you both point to emotional rather than physical causes (assuming his vet has ruled out medical issues like a urinary tract infection or arthritis). This is precisely the kind of situation where an experienced animal communicator may be able to help bridge the gap between Remy’s inner world and yours.

At Petworks, we work with highly regarded animal communicators and [cat behavior experts](https://www.petworks.com/hire/cat-behaviorist) who specialize in helping pet parents like you understand what might be going on in their pet’s mind and heart. These sessions, often conducted virtually, can uncover emotional triggers, [help your cat feel heard](https://www.petworks.com/hire/animal-communicators), and provide you with guidance on how to shift behaviors with empathy.

Ruth, you’ve given Remy a loving, safe home for 11 years. It’s not your fault this behavior persists, and you deserve peace of mind in your golden years. An animal communicator or behaviorist may offer insight into what’s driving Remy’s actions, and potentially bring relief for both of you.

With warmth and respect from everyone here at Petworks,

Kevin

# What’s the best way to safely socialize my puppy?

### **Dear Kev,**

“I recently brought home an 8-week-old Labrador puppy, and I keep hearing about how important early socialization is. But I’m nervous about exposing her to too much before she’s fully vaccinated. What’s the safest and most effective way to socialize Lilibet during these early weeks? I obviously want to set her up for a confident, happy life. So what’s the best way to socialize my pup safely during her early developmental stages?” – Christine (yes, I’m a hypervigilant pup parent) from Denver, Colorado.

### **Hi Christine,**

Great question. And I’m glad you asked early! The first 3 to 16 weeks of a puppy’s life is the ‘golden window’ for socialization. It’s when puppies are most open to new experiences, people, places, and other animals. If you miss this period or go too fast, you may end up with a fearful or reactive dog later.

Start slowly and safely. Let your puppy meet calm, vaccinated adult dogs and friendly people of different ages and appearances. Use positive reinforcement with treats, praise, and gentle encouragement. This will help your pup associate new things with good feelings. Carry your pup into pet-friendly stores, [let her walk on a variety of surfaces](https://www.k9sovercoffee.com/k9-confidence-building-by-walking-on-different-surfaces/), and expose her to sounds like vacuum cleaners or traffic in short, calm sessions.

If your puppy hasn’t finished her vaccines, avoid dog parks or unknown dogs, but safe puppy socialization classes (run by certified trainers in clean, controlled environments) can be a game-changer. The goal? Help your puppy build confidence, not overwhelm her. Always let Lilibet set the pace. And keep it fun.

Want help finding a certified dog trainer or socialization class near you? Petworks can connect you to [pros who specialize in positive, age-appropriate puppy training](https://www.petworks.com/hire/puppy-trainer). And remember, socializing your pup doesn’t mean throwing her into a puppy party like it’s 1988 spring break in Daytona. Think of it more like introducing Grandma to TikTok. Slow, gentle, with lots of snacks.
