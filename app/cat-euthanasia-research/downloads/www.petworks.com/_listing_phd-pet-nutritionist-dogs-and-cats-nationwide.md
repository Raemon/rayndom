# PhD Pet Nutritionist - Dogs and Cats - Nationwide

Verified Member since Jan 2025 

A PhD nutritionist with many years of experience both as a nutritionist and dog enthusiast, I bring education, experience and a deep love and understanding of the dog and this deep bond that exists between dogs and their families. I have practiced for 20 years privately and the first 5 1/2 years at the University of Tennessee, College of Vet Medicine, Veterinary Nutrition Service. I offer advice, support, custom formulations, commercial food recommendations, for all aspects of dog lives. I also formulate diets for cats as well as advising and recommending commercial formulations and cats diet management.
