# Woodland Grief Counseling- Pet Loss Bereavement Support - Nationwide

Verified Member since Aug 2025 

Hello, I'm Jeffrey Findlay, a NJ Certified Social Worker with over twenty years of experience as a counselor, committed to supporting both humans and their beloved pets through challenging times. As a Certified Social Work Case Manager and Dementia Support Group Facilitator, I've honed my skills over eighteen years working with various institutions. My journey into pet loss grief counseling was inspired by my cherished rescue dog, Casper, whose memory fuels my passion for helping others navigate the profound grief of losing a pet. With certifications from the American Academy of Grief Counseling and as a member of the Association for Pet Loss and Bereavement (APLB), I am well-equipped to provide compassionate support.

As a Certified Grief Counselor and Certified Pet-Loss Support Specialist, I specialize in assisting pet parents who are mourning the loss of their furry or non-furry family members. I offer my services to a wide range of animals, including birds, cats, dogs, rabbits, reptiles, and many more. I understand the unique bond between pets and their owners, and I am dedicated to providing a safe space for healing. My services are conveniently available online via platforms like Petworks, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams, ensuring accessibility no matter where you are. Additionally, I can communicate in American Sign Language, broadening my ability to connect with clients from diverse backgrounds.

My mission is to help you through the difficult journey of pet loss with empathy and understanding. Whether you're in Sussex County or beyond, I offer mobile services and am willing to travel to provide the support you need. If you're ready to begin your healing journey, I invite you to reach out and connect with me. Let me help you find peace and solace during this challenging time. Ready to get started? Book me through Petworks today!
