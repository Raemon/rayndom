Healing Sessions for You and/or Your Pets - 60 minutes

$125 Per 60 Minutes 

One session, many possibilities—support for yourself, your pets, or both.   
This service is designed to meet your needs: whether you’re sharing a healing journey with your pet, processing grief, facing personal health challenges, or supporting multiple pets in one session. 

Animals may absorb the emotional and energetic burdens of their human companions, sometimes mirroring or even taking on our ailments out of love and loyalty. But people also need direct support—for themselves, their pets, or both together.

As a certified instructor in ThetaHealing® and EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique), I help identify and release energetic patterns that create imbalance, supporting lasting transformation.

You’ll be amazed by the shifts that can happen—whether the healing is shared or individual.

⏰ Session date and time will be arranged via text after purchase. Most sessions are scheduled within 24 hours, and same-day emergency sessions are available when needed. Please send a clear photo of your animal before the session.

If you and/or your pet are dealing with an ailment, I recommend a package of three sessions.

✨ Bonus: Refer two people and receive a free 20-minute session!

Healing Package: Three 60-Minute Sessions for You and/or Your Pets

$350 Per Package 

Healing isn’t one-size-fits-all. Sometimes people seek support for themselves—processing grief, easing chronic illness, or releasing old emotional patterns. Other times, pets need focused care, or an entire furry family benefits from being included together. And often, person and pet share physical or emotional burdens that are best addressed side by side.

This 3-session package is designed to support you in the way you most need—gently, thoroughly, and with lasting transformation. Over the course of three 60-minute sessions, we’ll uncover and release the energetic, emotional, and physical patterns contributing to imbalance.

Using advanced techniques from ThetaHealing® and EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique), I create a safe, compassionate space for healing—whether the focus is you, your pets, or both together.

Package includes:   
✨ Three 60-minute sessions (for yourself, your pets, or shared)   
✨ A personalized healing approach tailored to your circumstances   
✨ Tools and practices to support healing between sessions

You’ll not only feel relief and renewal, but also deepen the connection, understanding, and peace within yourself and with your animal companions.

⏰ Session dates and times will be arranged via text after purchase. Most first sessions are scheduled within 24 hours, and same-day emergency sessions are available when needed. Please send a clear photo of your animal before the session.

✨ Bonus: Refer two people and receive a free 20-minute session!

Quantum Clearing™ for Homes – Support for Pets & Their People

$50 Per Session 

Your home holds energy—from past owners, daily stress, environmental factors, and even unseen influences. Pets are highly sensitive to these energetic imprints and often absorb stress, anxiety, or fear that doesn’t belong to them.

This remote Quantum Clearing™ session is designed to release low-frequency energies from your home and replace them with high-vibrational frequencies like peace, safety, and love—creating a more supportive space for both you and your animal companions.

This service includes:   
✨ Remote energy clearing of your home, yard, and any outbuildings   
✨ Removal of emotional residue, past trauma, and stuck energies   
✨ Infusion of calming, uplifting frequencies to support your pet’s well-being   
✨ Optional insight on energetic sensitivities affecting your pet

Whether your pet is acting out, anxious, withdrawn, or just not themselves, the energy in your home could be a contributing factor. Quantum Clearing™ helps restore balance so both of you can thrive.

No in-person visit required – clearing is done remotely and results are shared with you by message or call.

Let’s create a peaceful, energetically aligned home—for everyone under your roof.

BONUS - If you refer 2 people to me, you will get a free 20-minute session!

🐾 Lost Pet Support & Communication: A Different Approach

$50 Per Session 

When a beloved pet goes missing, fear and uncertainty can be overwhelming. My approach to lost pets is different from many traditional animal communication methods—and it’s guided by your animal’s awareness and connection to all things.   
✨ How My Approach Is Different   
Many animal communicators focus on:   
• “Seeing through the animal’s eyes” to identify landmarks nearby   
• Using tools such as pendulums or maps to discern a physical location   
While these methods can help, they are often limited—especially as time passes.   
✨ My Process   
I begin by communicating directly with your animal to understand their current situation and intentions. From there:   
• I determine whether your pet wants to return home and is able to do so   
• If appropriate, I work with the elements and the Law of Oneness, engaging the natural energetic networks your animal already responds to instinctively   
• Rather than sending you out searching, I support your pet in being energetically guided toward home   
This method honors the way animals naturally navigate the world—through intuition, resonance, and connection—rather than forcing a human framework onto their experience.   
✨ If Time Has Passed   
If your pet has been gone for weeks or months, I can often provide clarity around:   
• Whether they are alive   
• If they are being fed or cared for by someone   
• The general conditions they are experiencing   
If your pet has passed, I can connect with them to offer you closure and peace. In many cases, animals who have crossed over remain very close to their people and may even be present with you during the session.   
✨ Important Note on Expectations   
Lost pet cases are complex. No method—intuitive or practical—can guarantee physical recovery, especially after the first several days. For this reason, I offer this service at the minimum rate allowed on Petworks ($50). My intention is to make compassionate support accessible during a stressful time, while being honest about the challenges involved.   
💫 While outcomes vary, many clients find this session comforting and helpful in determining what steps—energetic or practical—are most aligned moving forward.
