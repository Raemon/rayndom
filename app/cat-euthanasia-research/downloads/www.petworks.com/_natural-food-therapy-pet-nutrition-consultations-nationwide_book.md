Custom Food Therapy Consultation– $150/session

$150 Per Session 

For Dogs & Cats with Chronic or Ongoing Health Concerns

This 1-on-1 consultation is designed for pets experiencing chronic or complex health issues such as digestive problems, allergies, skin conditions, low vitality, cancer support, palliative care, or difficult recovery after veterinary treatment.

Whether you are just beginning to explore natural support or are ready to move forward with a personalized food therapy plan, this session serves as the foundation for your pet’s healing journey.

During this 45-minute private consultation, we will:

\- Review your pet’s health history, current symptoms, and medical background

\- Discuss current diet, supplements, and medications

\- Explore lifestyle, environment, and your goals as a pet parent

\- Evaluate whether food therapy, herbs, and/or medicinal mushrooms are appropriate

This is a working session where we look deeply at your pet as a whole—body, history, and current condition.

Based on this consultation, I will:

\- Provide clear guidance on the best dietary direction

\- Recommend supportive herbs or mushrooms if appropriate

\- Outline next steps and suggest a personalized session plan based on your pet’s needs

\- Explain what ongoing support may look like (frequency and structure)

\-- How It Works --

After booking, you will receive a link to schedule your 45-minute consultation. We will review your pet’s information together during the session, and you will receive an email summary with clear next steps after the consultation.
