**AMA**

**What are some local towns and cities with professional dog walkers near me?**

Denver County, Aurora, Arvada, Lakewood, Thornton, Westminster, Centennial, Boulder, Highlands Ranch, Longmont, Castle Rock

**What should I look for in a professional dog walker, and should they have experience with different dog breeds and temperaments?**

Yes. Look for a dog walker in Denver, CO who has experience handling various dog sizes, breeds, and temperaments. They should know how to manage leash behavior, understand basic canine body language, and stay calm in unpredictable situations. A seasoned dog walker will tailor the walk to your dog’s energy level, personality, and any special needs they may have.

**Should I ask if the Denver, CO dog walker is insured, bonded, or background-checked before hiring them?**

Absolutely. Since dog walkers often have access to your home and care for your pet, it's important to ensure they’re trustworthy. Ask if they carry pet care liability insurance and have passed a background check. Professional walkers usually offer this information upfront, especially if they’re affiliated with a pet care platform or established business.

**How can I make sure the dog walker will keep my dog safe and provide consistent care?**

Choose a walker who is dependable, communicates clearly, and offers GPS-tracked walks or written updates. Ask how they handle emergencies, what they do if your dog gets scared or reactive, and whether they walk dogs individually or in groups. A good dog walker in Denver will follow your instructions carefully and make your dog’s safety and well-being their top priority.

**What are some nearby locations with dog walkers near me?**
