In-Person Search with Search Dogs – $50 Case Review

$ 50.00 Per Animal [book](/pet-search-and-rescue-lost-pet-recovery-services-tampa-fl/book?id=7800)

Before accepting a case for an in-person search with search dogs, a thorough case review is required to assess the situation. This review includes:

\- Analyzing maps of the search area (exact search location required for the review)   
\- Reviewing case details to understand the circumstances of the pet’s disappearance and the pet's profile   
\- Confirming travel time and if and when we have an open time in the schedule   
\- Identifying challenges that may impact the search, such as terrain, weather, or high-traffic areas   
\- Possibly consulting with other K9 handlers to discuss the case and gather insights   
\- Providing you with a quote or a range of what to expect to pay for in-person searches with search dogs. 

The case review process takes up to one hour, and there is a $50 case review fee. If you decide to move forward with an in-person search with us, this fee will be credited toward the total case fee. If you do not use an in-person search with us, this fee is NONREFUNDABLE. 

Even if you don't use our search dog services, the review is money well spent. The review will give you feedback and information to make the best choice in methods to use in your lost pet search, and save you from possible scams.

This step ensures that the search is well-prepared and that a K9 search is available, and a viable option for searching for your missing pet.

Time is essential, so please book the $50 Case Review now.
