**AMA**

**Is chiropractic care safe for cats, and how does it work?**

Yes, when performed by a licensed animal chiropractor (usually a veterinarian or a human chiropractor certified in animal chiropractic care), chiropractic adjustments are safe for cats. Chiropractic care focuses on the spine and nervous system, using gentle, hands-on adjustments to correct misalignments (called subluxations) in the spine or joints. These misalignments can affect nerve function and cause pain, mobility issues, or even digestive problems. The goal is to restore proper alignment, improve nerve flow, and support the cat’s overall health and comfort without the use of drugs or surgery.

**What are some local towns and cities with cat chiropractors near me?**

Harris County, The Woodlands, Pearland, Sugar Land, League City, Baytown, Missouri City, Atascocita, Spring, Pasadena, Conroe

**What symptoms or conditions can a Houston, TX cat chiropractor help with?**

Cat chiropractors in Houston commonly help with mobility issues, such as difficulty jumping, stiffness, or limping. They also address conditions like chronic pain, spinal injuries, arthritis, and nerve dysfunction. Behavioral changes, like increased aggression, reluctance to be touched, or hiding, can sometimes be linked to physical discomfort that chiropractic care may relieve. Many pet parents seek chiropractic help after their cat experiences a fall, shows signs of aging, or has ongoing issues that haven’t been resolved through traditional veterinary care. Regular chiropractic sessions can help cats move more freely and feel more at ease in their bodies.

**What are some nearby towns and cities with cat chiropractors near me?**

**How much does cat chiropractic care in Houston, Texas cost?**

As for costs, initial consultations typically range from $75 to $150, depending on the practitioner’s experience and your location. Follow-up sessions usually cost $50 to $100 each. Some practitioners offer discounted packages for multiple visits. Pet insurance may cover chiropractic care if it falls under alternative or rehabilitative therapies.
