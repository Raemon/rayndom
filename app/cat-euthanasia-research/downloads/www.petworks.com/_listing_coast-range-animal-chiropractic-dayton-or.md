# Coast Range Animal Chiropractic - Dayton, OR

Member since Aug 2025 

At Coast Range Animal Chiropractic, I'm passionate about enhancing the well-being of your beloved pets through gentle, evidence-based chiropractic techniques. With a Doctor of Chiropractic degree and certification as a board-certified animal chiropractor from the International Veterinary Chiropractic Association (IVCA), I specialize in treating both dogs and cats. My goal is to restore balance and improve the overall quality of life for your furry companions, ensuring they stay healthy and active for years to come.

With several years of experience in providing compassionate care, I understand the unique needs of domestic animals. I offer mobile services, allowing me to bring my expertise directly to your home, which not only makes it convenient for you but also helps your pets feel more comfortable in their own environment. Whether it’s a routine check-up or addressing specific concerns, I’m here to support your pet’s health journey, and my flexible scheduling includes online sessions if needed.

Don’t wait to give your pet the care they deserve! I invite you to book an appointment through Petworks today to experience the benefits of professional chiropractic care tailored specifically for your pets. Together, we can help your furry friends live their best lives!
