Canine Chiropractic Care

[Canine chiropractors](https://www.petworks.com/hire/dog-chiropractor) offer numerous benefits for beloved pups. Particularly those suffering from musculoskeletal issues, chronic pain, or mobility problems. This holistic approach involves the manual adjustment of a dog’s spine and joints. This helps to restore proper alignment and function.

By addressing misalignments, canine chiropractic care can alleviate pain, improve joint flexibility, and enhance overall mobility. This helps dogs to move more freely and comfortably. Additionally, it can help reduce inflammation and support the body’s natural healing processes. This makes the chiro care a valuable complement to traditional veterinary care.

Dogs with conditions like arthritis, hip dysplasia, or even those recovering from injuries or surgeries can experience significant relief and improved quality of life through regular chiropractic adjustments. Beyond physical benefits, chiropractic care can also promote better nervous system function. This may positively impact a dog’s behavior, digestion, and overall well-being.

Pet parents who choose chiropractic care for their dogs often notice an increase in their pet’s energy levels, a more balanced gait, and a happier demeanor, as their dogs are relieved of discomfort and able to enjoy a more active lifestyle. As part of a comprehensive wellness plan, dog chiropractic care offers a natural, non-invasive way to support a dog’s long-term health and vitality.

# What Is IVDD In Dogs?

Understanding IVDD in Dogs: A Comprehensive Guide to Affected Breeds and Treatment Options. What is IVDD in Dogs? Intervertebral Disc Disease (IVDD) is a degenerative spinal condition that affects a dog’s intervertebral discs, leading to pain, nerve damage, and, in severe cases, paralysis. IVDD occurs when the cushioning discs between the vertebrae become damaged or rupture, compressing the spinal cord. This condition is particularly common in dogs with long backs and short legs but can affect any breed. The disease is classified into two types: Hansen Type I, which involves a sudden disc rupture, and Hansen Type II, which is a gradual degeneration of the discs over time.

# How Do I Best Manage My Basset Hound’s Weight?

Basset Hound Health Care and Wellness: A Comprehensive Petworks Guide. Basset Hounds are beloved for their long ears, droopy eyes, and gentle disposition. As a breed known for its laid-back nature and affectionate personality, they make excellent family pets. However, like all breeds, Basset Hounds require proper health care and wellness maintenance to ensure a long, happy life. From nutrition to grooming and veterinary care, this guide covers essential aspects of keeping your Basset Hound in peak condition.

### **Some Of The Things We’ll Cover In This Guide:**

  * best weight-management dog food for Basset Hounds

  * how to create a feeding schedule for Basset Hounds

  * quick ways to reduce Basset Hound weight

  * vet tips for Basset Hound weight control

  * Basset Hound Health and Wellness Tips



### **Basset Hound Weight Management: Keeping Your Dog Healthy**

Managing your Basset Hound’s weight is essential for their long-term health. This breed is prone to obesity due to their short legs, long body, and love of food. Extra weight puts stress on their spine, hips, and joints, leading to mobility problems and increasing the risk of arthritis and other health issues. By combining a proper diet, consistent exercise, and mindful routines, you can help your Basset Hound stay fit, active, and happy.

The first step in Basset Hound weight management is assessing whether your dog is overweight. You should be able to feel your Basset Hound’s ribs without them being visible, and there should be a noticeable waist when viewed from above. A sagging belly, reduced stamina, or difficulty moving may indicate your Basset Hound is carrying extra weight. Regular weigh-ins at home or during vet visits provide a baseline to track progress.

Feeding a balanced, portion-controlled diet is key. Choose high-quality dog food designed for medium breeds, with moderate calories and sufficient protein to maintain lean muscle. Avoid free-feeding, which can lead to overeating, and use measured portions at consistent meal times. Slow-feeder bowls can help prevent gulping and improve digestion. Treats should be limited to under 10% of daily calories, and healthy options like carrots, green beans, or commercial low-calorie dog treats are ideal for supporting weight loss.

### **Move That Booty**

Daily exercise is another important component of Basset Hound weight control. While Basset Hounds are not built for running, they benefit from steady, moderate walks two to three times per day. Allowing time for sniffing and scent exploration adds mental stimulation while burning calories. Indoor activities such as puzzle feeders, gentle play, and scent games can supplement physical activity without putting too much strain on joints.

Consistency is critical for successful Basset Hound weight management. Avoid giving in to begging or offering extra treats, as even small indulgences can slow progress. For overweight Basset Hounds, your veterinarian can create a structured weight-loss plan with safe calorie targets and activity recommendations tailored to your dog.

By combining a healthy Basset Hound diet, daily exercise, and consistent routines, you can maintain your dog’s ideal weight, protect their joints and spine, and ensure a longer, healthier life. Proper weight management not only improves mobility but also enhances overall well-being, keeping your Basset Hound energetic and happy.

### **Nutrition: A Balanced Diet for a Healthy Basset Hound**

Proper [dog nutrition](https://www.petworks.com/hire/dog-nutritionist) plays a crucial role in a Basset Hound’s overall health. These dogs tend to be prone to obesity, so feeding them a high-quality, well-balanced diet is essential. Choose dog food that contains high protein and moderate fat content while avoiding fillers such as corn, wheat, and soy.

  * **Portion Control** : Basset Hounds love food, but overfeeding can lead to joint problems and excessive weight gain. Follow recommended portion sizes based on their weight and age.
  * **Healthy Treats** : Opt for treats like lean meats, carrots, or blueberries instead of high-calorie biscuits.
  * **Hydration** : Always provide fresh water to keep your Basset Hound hydrated, especially after physical activity.
  * **Supplements** : Omega-3 fatty acids can help maintain joint health, and probiotics support digestive wellness.



“The vet said that bassets are very easy to overfeed because they always act hungry and can be lazy.” – [Reddit User](https://www.reddit.com/r/basset/comments/vbgc0n/weight_control/)

### **Training: Establishing Good Behavior Early On**

Basset Hounds are intelligent yet [stubborn](https://www.jonathansjournal.dog/blog/why-are-hounds-so-stubborn), which can make training a challenge. Early training is necessary to establish good habits and prevent behavioral issues.

  * **Positive Reinforcement** : Use rewards such as treats, praise, and playtime to encourage good behavior.
  * **Basic Commands** : Teach commands like “sit,” “stay,” and “come” early to establish obedience.
  * **Socialization** : Expose your Basset Hound to different people, pets, and environments to foster confidence and reduce anxiety.
  * **Consistency is Key** : Due to their independent nature, Basset Hounds respond best to short, consistent training sessions.



### **Chiropractic Care: Supporting Joint and Spinal Health**

Basset Hounds have long backs and short legs, making them susceptible to [spinal and joint issues](https://www.dogshealth.com/arthritis-in-basset-hounds/). Chiropractic care can help maintain proper alignment and mobility.

  * **Benefits** : Regular adjustments can reduce stiffness, improve mobility, and alleviate pain caused by misalignment.
  * **When to Seek Care** : If your Basset Hound shows signs of limping, difficulty standing, or reluctance to move, a visit to a [canine chiropractor](https://www.petworks.com/hire/dog-chiropractor) may help.
  * **Preventative Care** : Regular low-impact exercise, such as walking or swimming, can prevent spinal stress.



### **Grooming: Keeping Your Basset Hound Clean and Healthy**

Basset Hounds have short but dense coats that require regular grooming to keep their skin and fur healthy.

  * **Brushing** : Use a soft-bristle brush once or twice a week to reduce shedding and remove dirt.
  * **Ear Care** : Due to their long, floppy ears, Basset Hounds are prone to ear infections. Clean their ears weekly with a vet-approved solution.
  * **Nail Trimming** : Trim their nails every few weeks to prevent overgrowth and discomfort.
  * **Bathing** : Give your Basset Hound a bath every 4-6 weeks to keep their coat clean while avoiding over-drying their skin.



### **Veterinary Visits: Preventative Care for a Long Life**

Routine vet visits are crucial for detecting and preventing health issues early. Basset Hounds are prone to certain conditions that require regular monitoring.

  * **Annual Checkups** : Routine vet visits help detect issues such as ear infections, joint pain, and weight management concerns.
  * **Vaccinations** : Keep up with core vaccinations like rabies, distemper, and parvovirus to protect your pet from serious illnesses.
  * **Dental Care** : Basset Hounds can suffer from gum disease, so regular dental cleanings and at-home brushing are essential.
  * **Common Health Issues** : This breed is prone to hip dysplasia, ear infections, and bloat, making early detection extremely important.
