Perhaps the hardest decision you will have to make in your pet’s life is when to euthanize. We would all prefer that our pets die naturally, peacefully, and pain-free. It is a choice we never want to have to make. Unfortunately, there are times when a disease process takes over and will not allow for a peaceful death. Euthanasia is a gift that we can use to spare suffering in our beloved companions. Our pets love us unconditionally, their entire lives…the last gift we can give to them is to allow them to cross the rainbow bridge before they are suffering. 

Grieving is an intimate, private, process. It is understandable that you would want to be in the privacy of your own home, rather than a place of business, when it comes time to saying your final goodbye to your pet. Some other reasons why you might want to choose to euthanize at home include:

-Your pet is unable to walk or has great difficulty moving around

-Your pet hates going to the veterinarian’s office and it creates tremendous anxiety and fear 

-You want your pet to be laying on his/her favorite bed, the couch, or your lap during the process 

-You want to be able to include your entire family 

## How do I know when it’s time?

Many people struggle with knowing which day is the right day. We selfishly want every moment we can get with our pets. We want to wait until it’s clear that it is time. Unfortunately, often times, this means we wait until our pets are truly suffering. We have the ability to spare our loved ones from unnecessary suffering. Below are some questions you can ask to determine if the time is right. 

-Does he/she still enjoy playing with you or with toys?

-Are there more good days than bad days?

-Is your pet getting up and using the bathroom in appropriate places?

-Is your pet living pain free?

-Is there anything your pet still looks forward to?

If the answer to several of these is "no", it might be time to let your loved one go. It is such a difficult decision to make, but remember to think of it as one last gift you can give to your wonderful companion...to let them go in peace, before they are suffering.

If you are not sure it is time, consider scheduling a “Quality of Life” exam with your regular veterinarian for some guidance.

## What is the process like?

When the time comes to say goodbye, Dr. Martin will arrive at your home at the scheduled appointment time. All pets will receive a sedative prior to the euthanasia. This consists of an injection given under the skin to relax your pet. This medication will make your pet fall asleep in roughly 5 to 15 minutes. While the sedative takes effect, you may hold and comfort and talk to your pet. Once your pet is sleeping, Dr. Martin will administer the euthanasia solution into a vein or into the body cavity. Since your pet will be asleep, the process will be pain free. 

## What happens afterwards?

After the euthanasia, Dr. Martin will give you time to say your final goodbyes. When you are ready, she will take the remains to the crematory for cremation if you choose to have your pet cremated. There is a communal cremation option, where no remains are returned, or there is a private cremation option, where you can have your pet’s ashes returned to you in an urn. 

Alternatively, some people choose to bury their pets in a special place in their yard. 

If you wish, Dr. Martin will notify your veterinarian of your pet’s passing. 

## Meet the Dr.

Dr. Elise Martin graduated from UC Davis Veterinary School in 2004. She worked in a full service veterinary hospital in Bakersfield off and on for 17 years. She has 4 daughters, a husband (who is also a veterinarian) and 2 dogs (a golden Retriever named Curry and a Maltese mix named Francine), 1 cat (Batman), and a guinea pig (Honeybear). In her free time, Dr. Martin enjoys training for marathons, reading, and playing the piano. 

Many people comment that this job must be very difficult. Dr. Martin’s response to this is, 

“This job is my calling. When I go into a family’s home for euthanasia, the grief and love they are feeling for their pet are immense. I know right away that this pet had a good life. Euthanasia literally means ‘good death.’ I am grateful that the owners are setting aside their own personal feelings to give their loved ones the final gift of a good death. I feel honored to be a part of that.”
