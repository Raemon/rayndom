# In Memory of Pesach – ‘Bunnie’

Pesach – ‘Bunnie’

Pesach ‘Bunnie’ Mark LeVine was a feral kitty who was taken from her mom when she was 4 weeks old by the grandpa of a friend. When the friend’s family was unable to care for her, and knowing that we’d recently lost our beloved kitty Peanut, they called us. We took one look at Pesach’s little face peeping out from the washcloth in which she’d been wrapped, and knew she was meant to be ours. She was a fierce and independent soul who loved anchovy treats, drinking water from the faucet, dragging stuffed animals around the house, and snuggling with her little pink bunny and the occasional lucky human. We will miss her forever.
