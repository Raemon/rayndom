# In Memory of “Ruby”

“Ruby”

Ruby:  
The geese always flew away from me, they always had such a fit. When I broke the cat door with my head, you all laughed quite a bit.  
The baby duckling I carried home was my newfound friend, he didn’t have a scratch.  
Although, that bird I snatched out of the air was a dandy catch.  
I may have gotten arrested a time or two or three.  
But it really was ok, cuz the police man gave a treat to me.  
So if you miss me when I’m absent, just remember this for me,  
I’ll still be with my mom, eatin tasty blueberries.
