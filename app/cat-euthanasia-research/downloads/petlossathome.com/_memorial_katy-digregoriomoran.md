# In Memory of “Katy” DiGregorio/Moran

“Katy” DiGregorio/Moran

One of the funniest stories is that we almost didn’t adopt her from Pets In Need. Dave was looking at a little brown Chihuahua in the next pen, and then when they brought Katy out into the get-acquainted room, she immediately pooped on the floor, lol. Dave said, “I don’t want a pooper!!!”, and then he picked her up and she laid in his arms on her back with her little arms up in the air like a baby and…..next thing you know, we’re signing the papers, taking her home, and stopping at Taco Bell to give her her very first snack, haaa. And for the next 15 years she was “Our Little Pooper”. *:)
