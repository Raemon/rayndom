# In Memory of Flaco

Flaco

I’ve had him and his brother Gordo for almost 14 years.  
Flaco was the most affectionate cat I’ve ever met. He is a special soul and we will miss hearing him purr lovingly for us. He greeted us everyday and was spoiled rotten his whole life. We are confident that his soul lives on and we will meet again. A piece of our heart left with him.
