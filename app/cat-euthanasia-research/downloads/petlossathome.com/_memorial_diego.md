# In Memory of “Diego”

“Diego”

Diego Stanley Maliekel was the dog of a lifetime. He was adopted from Coastal German Shepherd Rescue OC. Diego enjoyed hiking in the Sierras, chasing waves, and playing bandit with his sisters and brothers. He was patient, gentle, and playful. An extremely dear and noble soul. He was diagnosed with osteosarcoma earlier this year, and over the last few months he enjoyed the pleasures of multiple beach trips a week and an ice cream cone (something he had always wanted but never was allowed)! His passing leaves a deep sadness; he will be remembered always.
