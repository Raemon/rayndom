# In Memory of “Charger”

“Charger”

“Our precious baby Charger crossed the Rainbow bridge today after 13 2/3 years. He passed away peacefully at home. Scott Smouter & are absolutely heart broken. This is the hardest decision that we have ever made. Charger was the best dog you could ever ask for, our first Dog as adults and my Wedding present to Scott. Charger loved his kids soo much and was soo happy when they would come home to visit. Charger was not well and his health was rapidly declining. We are thankful that we could have him at home with us and have a comforting peaceful crossing. We are thankful that Dr. Christine Scott was able to be here to help him across the Rainbow bridge. She has a calming presence and explained things in detail.”  
Thank you Matthew Risch for helping with Sage through this process.

We love you Charger! Run & play with Gramma & Grampa Smouter now that you are pain free.
