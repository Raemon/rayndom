> > > > | Chicago: Dr. Aaron Vigil – Recently we were faced with the very sad decision to put our cat Ava, suffering with intestinal lymphoma, to sleep. I called your organization and was given Dr. Aaron Vigil’s name and spoke with him. I told him I was not certain if the time was right and would need to discuss with this my sister and he gave me his personal number to call anytime. Later on Friday evening I called and asked if it would be possible to come to our home on Saturday morning. He responded immediately and asked what would work best for us. All the anxiety of timing and a possible emergent run to a sterile vet clinic were eliminated. He was kind, compassionate, gentle and sat with us and prayed with us as our precious pet quietly and peacefully left us. He gave council to dealing with her remaining litter mate and stayed quietly with us. It was nothing short of a miracle and answer to prayer that a man of his character and faith would be part of this painful experience. Thank you all for what you do. You are all a blessing to animal owners.

> “We want to say thank you for making Emma’s paw cast and dropping it by our house last month. It’s beautiful and we will cherish it forever. Also, thank you for helping Emma cross over the Rainbow Bridge back on Oct 20th. We are forever grateful that she passed peacefully.”

> When you sent your email, I went through your company website with some clarity, and it was actually quite enlightening and extremely helpful. I’ve been looking for answers, for questions I didn’t even know I had…and they they were…all on your website. It helped me feel more at ease with our decision, knowing now it was best. Even looking at all his pics and videos, I see now what I could t see before..that he was in pain, that he was not himself, that it needed to stop for his sake. This releases the guilt I’ve been carrying for ending his life, and the selfishness I’ve been feeling for wanting him back. Thank you for everything Dr Liu.

> A short time ago, toward the end of August, 2019, we found we needed to allow our French Bulldog Andre to go to the Rainbow bridge. We have never used a home vet visit to put one of our beloved pets to sleep. I can not express my thanks to Dr. Monica for providing this service for us. It was peaceful and memorable. Andre laid in my lap, with one of our dogs laying on my shoulder looking down on him, one seated on the floor looking up at him. He wasn’t frightened, but happy laying inn my arms with me quietly singing his song to him. Very gently he went to sleep. I don’t know why, but I feel his presence in the home. I had the experience with our other pets of being transferred to the vets office and our baby becoming a little upset. There was nothing like that with Andre. Thank you Dr. Monica for your patience, your kindness, for all that you provided for us and Andre. Carol Joyce

> Dr. Laurelle Danton:
> 
> I can’t say enough good about Dr Laurelle Danton. She helped my husband and I through one of the most difficult experiences of our lives. Two weeks ago we had to have our sweet little 13-year-old pug, Bugsy, euthanized. He had become very ill and it was evident he had to be put down before he got any worse. Dr. Danton spent quite a bit of time with me on the phone in the days leading up to his death. During the procedure she took time to explain everything to us and allow us plenty of time to say goodbye to our beloved little boy. Throughout the entire process she never rushed with anything and it was obvious she loves animals and would do nothing to cause undue pain. As horrible as having to do this was, having it done at home by Dr. Danton was the best possible way it could have been done. I would recommend this service, and especially Dr. Danton, to anyone who has to euthanize a pet.

> Excellent, compassionate, fantastic vet Dr. Niqole Varani from this wonderful company came to our 10-year-old black lab Jesse Jr.’s rescue today to put him to peace, no more lymphoma pain. If anyone considers in home vs at the vet’s office this is the group to use!! Really put us and the dog at ease. We are so grateful for her exceptional compassion towards us in a very difficult hour!! Thank you!! She is most definitely a vet to keep on your staff!!!

> I used this service last night to relieve my sweet baby Topaz from his pain. He was 17, and I can hardly remember life without him. He is the love of my life. I knew I couldn’t wait another day, and I was thankful to find this service to come after hours to our home. Thank you, and I highly recommend this service to anyone who has to go through the loss of their pet. It is the best decision you can make for them…..to end the suffering. Please do not wait until they are too far gone in pain. The hardest part is letting go. Mommy loves you Topey Bear

> On Monday, August 26, 2013, we used this service to say goodbye to our furry baby, Casey. Learning about PetLossAtHome from a friend helped inform us enough to confirm our decision to put Casey down was the right one at the right time for her. She was just a month short of her 17th birthday. We were very blessed to have her in our lives all those yrs, but our home will never be quite the same without her. The vet did an outstanding job of handling us humans with patience and compassion in those last minutes that we had with our little girl, which made saying goodbye to her peacefully laying in her own bed in our bedroom so much better than a sterile vet’s office. I would highly recommend this service to anyone who is dealing with an older dog.

> Me and my husband would like to thank Dr. Dale Paley for not only helping our Chiko to have the peaceful passing at home he deserved but going out of her way to come days quicker than we planned when she had somewhere else to be the next day. Our dog had a bad seizure and we did not think he would make it and Dr. Paley found a different place to have him cremated that was open on Sunday and came right over even though we were 3 hours away. If you have a larger dog, the service is the best way to go! Thanks Dr. Paley and Pet Loss At Home for making our loss much more bearable.

> This is Grizzely, our 13 year old Mastiff. On October 6, 2013 we chose to send him to doggie heaven to relieve his pain and suffering. Dr. Jamie Griffin and Dr. David Sherer we truely wonderful through this painful process. Having to avoid the fearful car ride and vet visit was a blessing. I wanted to thank you for this service, it is something I am going to reccomend to everyone. This is not an easy decision to make, however they made the process as easy as possible and with the most amount of compassion and caring that a person can give. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.

> We used Pet Loss at Home on April 12, 2014. I can highly recommend them. I had called three in-home euthanasia services, and Pet Loss at Home is the only one who actually answered the phone. I made an appointment with Dr. Henderson for a Sunday, and then had to call her back when I realized our Moon needed to go sooner. She was flexible and agreed to come the same afternoon I called her. This was such a relief for us. Moon gets so nervous at the vet, and I did not want his last moments to be ones of fright and discomfort. Dr. Henderson came to our home and sent Moon on his way in a very loving manner. Dr. Henderson was very compassionate, and she explained to us what to expect. The whole experience was as good as it can be. I will use them again when the time comes for our next pet to pass on to the next life. Thank you, Dr. Henderson. Thank you, Pet Loss at Home.

> Thank you Pet Loss at Home and Dr. Monique Lewison for coming out so late in the evening to come to our time of need. Your kindness and compassion brought such comfort to everyone. Our 13 year old yellow lab, Libby, was able to pass away in her favorite spot of the house. Thank you hardly covers our gratitude. God bless.

> Last night we had to put our 13 year old kitty down. We were so grateful that we were able to do this in the comfort of home and ensure her last moments were without any fear or pain. It meant a lot to me to be snuggled with her for her transition. Thank you for your compassionate staff, our vet was very kind and took the process slowly for the utmost level of comfort.

> I recently utilized the home euthanasia services of Pet Loss At Home for our dog. Dr. Jaime Griffin was so wonderful that I just had to write to let you know. We really appreciated her professionalism and compassion, she made a difficult situation so much easier for us. The process was so peaceful and special, definitely the way that our best friend deserved. Dr. Jaime showed so much kindness and care for our pet that I was completely at ease with the decision we made. I would recommend Dr. Jaime to anyone.

> Dear Dr. Jaime Griffin…How do we thank you? Circumstances beyond our control enabled you to enter our lives at just the precise time. You genuinely felt our pain and helped us to absorb the sadness. Your loving touch and gentle spirt made an unbearable situation manageable. You took our precious Jackson home, and for that, we are overwhelmingly grateful. How do we say thank you? We say it with a prayer to God for you and your special ability to provide loving care to the most vulnerable creatures who love us so deeply and innocently. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.

> We lost our precious puppy Nayla. She lost the use of her legs and couldn’t hold herself up anymore. It came on quickly and Nayla was such a fighter. After all of the tests, the doctors thought that it might be a brain tumor. Nayla gave us 7 years of such joy and love. For anyone who has to go through something like this, I highly recommend Pet Loss at Home. Dr. Alicia Darden, was so loving to Nayla and all of us and she made such a sad experience, very dignified and full of Love.

> The only good thing about losing my dear, sweet Buddy was being able to hold him in my arms on my living room floor. Dr. Niqole Varani was kind and compassionate. Having these kinds of end-of-life quality choices make a rotten event somewhat less awful. Thanks and I will recommend you.

> RIP Cody. ???? I strongly recommend petlossathome.com. We knew it was time and Cody was really suffering from the arthritis in his hips. We called this afternoon and Dr Niqole Varani came to our house this evening. She was really compassionate and I couldn’t imagine having to bring him to a vet’s office to put him down. I think he knew, too, because he got himself up and walked around giving gentle kisses to all of our hands, even the doctor’s! 30 minutes after he was buried, it started to rain … tears from heaven. Thank you!

> Yes, everything worked out well. Dr. Tim Lyon was so sweet and compassionate, and he came a long way, as soon as he could. Putting him down to sleep at home was the best decision to make for Buddy, who would freak out in a car or at the Vet’s. Thank you for having this service. Buddy was cremated the following morning, and I took a long nap with him in my arms. I have three other cats, but he was the love of my life..

> Thank you, Dr. Kristin Rowe. You didn’t have to come after hours, but you did. Each of has a calling and I am so happy you answered yours. You made a tough time bearable and Astro’s death easier on us all. We appreciate you.
