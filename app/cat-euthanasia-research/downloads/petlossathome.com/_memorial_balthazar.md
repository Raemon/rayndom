# In Memory of “Balthazar”

“Balthazar”

Balthazar greeted me with a shy tail wag and a kiss on my hand this evening. He said for pets for just a few moments before he rolled over to his side asking for belly rubs. He was the type of sweet pooch who never met a stranger. He was a gentle giant of 95 lbs and a most beautiful white German Shepherd who was regal and with very soulful eyes. He passed ever so peacefully at home on his favorite rug with his family on this cold winter night.
