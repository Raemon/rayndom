# In Memory of Nikki Kearney

Nikki Kearney

Thank you for the kind words. I am doing all I can to function today. I keep looking at photos and movies on my phone. I cant seem to let go just yet.

Last night was tough because Nikki slept at my side every night. I would stroke her until she was snoring. She went everywhere I went, and now I don’t hear her collar jingle following me anymore. She loved to ride in the car with her head out the sunroof to feel the wind. She was a Kentucky rescue dog that no one else wanted. I am sure glad we took a chance and gave Nikki a home.

She was my precious girl! I will never be the same.

Sincerely,

Karden
