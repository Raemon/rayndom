# In Memory of “Winnie & Nicky”

“Winnie & Nicky”

To Winnie & Nicky,

Thank you for sharing your life with us. We were happier because of you two. May you run and play ball together forever, the best of friends! The Moreno family is left with a hole in our hearts but it will serve as a reminder of how lucky we were to have you.

Love, Rudi, Gloria, Andrea & Juliana❤️
