# In Memory of “Sweet Princess” Haas

“Sweet Princess” Haas

This is my Sweet Princess. I was fortunate enough to be her Mom for 17 years. I will keep her in my heart forever. She was such a special, loving, quirky kitty and I loved her with all of my being.  
Princess, Rest in love and peace my sweet heart. I will miss you every single day. I pray you are running and jumping and in no pain. Kisses and kisses to you in kitty heaven. I love you…. always and forever. muah
