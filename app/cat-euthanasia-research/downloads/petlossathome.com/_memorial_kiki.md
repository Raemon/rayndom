# In Memory of Kiki

Kiki

“Kiki was our favorite little sister. She was a real lump; she loved to loaf around, eat wet food, and doze off lazily. Kiki was a real sweetie when she wanted to be, like most cats, but she always kept us company through and through. We love her and will miss her dearly. Hopefully we can give her chin scratches and head bumps on the other side.”
