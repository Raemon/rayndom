# In Memory of Oakley

Oakley

This was the last picture I took of my Oakley. It was taken on Dec. 24, 2018. Little did I know how sick he really was. I knew he had aches and pains from his 11 years of life. He was recovering from an ACL tear and I suspected he may have cancer but I never thought that less than a month later, he would be gone forever. My dear Oakley was the greatest companion, uniquely special, so gentle, friendly and loving. He couldn’t go for a walk without someone voicing how beautiful he was and ask if they could pet him. But the thing I miss the absolute most is when he “talked” to me when I arrived home or he wanted something or when greeting visitors or just when he was excited about something. The house is now silent except for my tears and I will love and miss him forever.
