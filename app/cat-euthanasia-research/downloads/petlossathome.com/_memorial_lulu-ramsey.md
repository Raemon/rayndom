# In Memory of “Lulu Ramsey”

“Lulu Ramsey”

“Lulu girl, what can I say. You were my “sassy” light and my joy for 10 years. You left me and your brother too soon. I love you to the moon and back and will never forget you. I hope you get all the walks and all the treats and love in the place beyond the rainbow. A couple of weeks ago we saw that double rainbow, and I know that one just wasn’t enough for you… you wanted to be perched on the second higher one looking out and down on everyone. Miss you daily.”

-Love Mom and Jax
