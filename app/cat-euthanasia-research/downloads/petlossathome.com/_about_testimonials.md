> “Words cannot fully describe how grateful we are for the level of care Dr. Julianne provided to our family and our beloved Joey. During such an incredibly difficult and emotional time, everything can feel overwhelming and confusing, but Dr. Julianne guided us through the process with clarity, calmness, and compassion. She was deeply comforting to our entire family and treated Joey with the utmost respect and tenderness, carefully preserving his dignity until the very end. Her kindness and professionalism brought us peace during one of the hardest moments ever. We are eternally grateful for Dr. Julianne’s compassion and the beautiful care she gave to our sweet boy, Joey.”

> “I am so thankful for Dr. Caroline Garrett here in Utah. When it came time to make that difficult decision to end my 18 year old cat’s suffering before it got bad, my regular vet was booked out for home visits and referred me to this service. Dr. Garrett was able to come 2 days after I called, giving me time to spend with my boy and make sure he got all the love he deserved before his departure. On the day, she showed up at the exact time we’d set, and the experience was so gentle and seamless. My boy got to leave this world comfortable and surrounded by love just as I’d hoped. She put so much care into making sure the process wasn’t rushed, that we were all ready and comfortable and she gave my family the respect we needed during this time. While I hope to not see her again anytime soon, I will definitely be reaching out when the time comes for my other senior cat.

> I 100% recommend this service when it’s time to let your furry friend go. No cold clinical vet room or freezing metal table, just focusing on what matters most. Surprisingly affordable as well.”

> “Dr. Leverone was very kind and compassionate when we had to say goodbye to our Abby. He walked us through every step and gave us time while going through it. Having the opportunity to do this in the comfort of her own home was comforting for all of us. Thank you so much.”

> “Dr. Gail was so tender and thoughtful when she spent time with my daughter and I to say goodbye to our beloved family dog, Max. It was heart wrenching, but he needed to be relieved of his discomfort and his 16 years with us were always joyful. We are thankful for her knowing touch and her quiet presence.”

> “Dr. Caroline Garret helped me and my wife with our 5 year old black lab Annie who was diagnosed with cancer. She was very kind and professional, and I would highly recommend her to anybody, this was the best decision I could have made for my little girl.”

> “Our dog had cancer and had been doing well but then declined very quickly. We decided tht it was time and called Dr. Teague on a Sunday afternoon. He was able to come within a couple of hours and it was peaceful which was a comfort to us. We opted for a private cremation and the ashes were returned to us in a beautiful wooden urn with a nice card. We appreciate that we were able to provide this final care for our sweet dog in a timely and caring way.”

> “Dr. Caroline was so wonderful to work with! She was totally flexible about what time we needed her to come to our house and how long we needed her to stay. She was incredibly sensitive, patient, and understanding. She was very respectful of our wishes and of our dog both before and after his passing. We could not recommend her more for anyone who has to say goodbye to a beloved pet.”

> “Dr. Darden is like an angel on earth. She has a quiet supportive presence and heartfelt compassion. She has been here for my family with the loss of our precious Cavalier King Charles Spaniels … three in the past 4 years due to age and failing health. I am grateful the service can be provided at home. I know it made this difficult time a little less hard.”

> Dear Dr. Leverone,
> 
> I want to thank your for your kindness in putting our beloved Molly down. It was a perfect ending to the wonderful life we gave her. We received her ashes on Friday. She was a wonderful dog who deserved the best and you made that happen!
> 
> Thanks so much!

> “This is our sweet Chloe who was with us for 17 years. Unfortunately her quality of life was such that we had to send her over the rainbow yesterday, with the help of Dr Pietschmann. We will miss her a lot, we only had her for 17 years, which still is not enough, but fortunately she did have us for her whole life. I called her Glowworm!”

> “My Gemma was so important to me and Cassie Schneller was the best. I could not have predicted a better outcome she was kind and compassionate and professional and made the passing of my dog so smooth and loving I am so grateful for this service!”

> “I just want to say thank you to Dr. Inness for her care and compassion in helping our Fred “transition.” It was good for him to have his human family with him and he’s now under a rose bush where the birds gather and sing for him.”

> “Dr. Bender made the loss of our pet the easiest and most peaceful process possible. We did not feel rushed, everything was thoroughly explained, and it was worth every penny. Our cat was treated with ample respect.”

> “Dr. Monica Inniss helped us say goodbye to my beloved cat, Roxy. This was the best choice for us given that Roxy didn’t do well at the vet and she got to pass peacefully in my arms. I appreciated the vet’s kindness and also her sense of humor which I needed during that time. Roxy was delivered to us by Dr. Inniss as we choose cremation and I was even given her paw print and some of her fur which was something I regretted not doing when she was taken away for cremation. Although I am devastated by this loss, I really appreciated how smoothly and peacefully this was for Roxy.”

> “Dr. Decter was so helpful during the most difficult time for our family. She was very empathetic and so kind. She was able to perform the procedure very professionally and walked us through every step to make sure everything went smoothly. I know this line of work has to be one the most difficult professions and she took care of our family and minimized the pain as much as she could during this emotional and stressful event.”

> Having to make the decision to send our “Buddy” over the Rainbow Bridge after 14 years of him being a huge part of our family was not easy. Speaking with Donna on the phone calmed us. She came to our home and explained all that would happen and through tears and goodbyes Buddy was in his own surroundings and not scared when he peacefully went to sleep. Thank you Donna for your compassion and patience. We are at peace knowing our Buddy was ready to ……go home .

> “My family and I cannot be more grateful for Dr. Kinkade and Pet Loss At Home. I contacted the service in the wee hours of a terrible morning where it was clear our dear cat Thelma had plummeted into suffering. When no other vets were responding or available, she not only called me back within a half hour, but put her own life on hold to squeeze us in and start driving our direction nearly immediately. From the moment she arrived to the moment she left, we felt truly cared for with professionalism and deep compassion. But even more important to us was that Thelma was clearly her top priority and she saw to it that Thelma died with dignity and pain, poke and prod-free (something Thelma had adamantly requested for her own passing ;). We will forever be indebted to this service and to Dr. Kinkade for ensuring that Thelma (and our family) suffered as little as possible at the end.”

> For Dr. Holly
> 
> There is no decision more difficult for pet parents to make than to know it is time to say goodbye. After 14 years with our furry boy, Trouper (Yorkie-Poodle mix), it was obvious he was struggling to breathe through his collapsing trachea.
> 
> After we contacted Dr. Holly she texted us in the days before to get as much information as she could about our Trouper. She even checked in the evening before to make sure we still wanted to have her come! From the moment she arrived her gentleness and compassion were evident. She took the time to give Trouper some of his favorite treats and get to know him. She explained every single step that would happen, then explained each step again as we proceeded!
> 
> She listened to our stories and looked at the pictures my husband showed her, as Trouper laid on his pillow on my lap. We never felt rushed! After being constant companions for over 14 years it is impossible to describe the depth of despair we felt. With Dr. Holly’s help we made it through, knowing we had made the right decision at the right time!

> Dr. Forrest Franklin and his team are A+, top notch. They’re caring, professional, personable, and patient. Their kind, gentle manner made a challenging situation much easier. Would highly recommend.

> “We are so grateful for Dr. Kinkade and Pet Loss at Home for allowing us to give our Wolfie such a beautiful send off.
> 
> Dr. Kinkade was so kind, patient, and communicative. She went out of her way to help us with decision-making and crafted the most wonderful mementos to remember our beloved boy.
> 
> Though the grief is overwhelming, we feel lucky and grateful for the services and care provided by Pet Loss at Home.”
> 
> Thank you.

> “Dr. Scott is absolutely amazing. She is incredibly kind, deeply compassionate, and very professional. During one of the most difficult times in our lives, Dr. Scott helped us say goodbye to our beloved dog, Blake, with grace and dignity. She was so patient with us throughout the entire process, offering gentle support and understanding every step of the way. I am truly grateful to Dr. Scott for her warmth and care. I would wholeheartedly recommend her to anyone facing the heartbreaking decision to part with their beloved dog. Her presence made an unbearable moment easier.”

> Dr. Liz took care of our sweet Ophelia AND us in our little one’s final moments, and we couldn’t have asked for a better veterinarian to guide us through the difficult experience of saying goodbye. We felt her warm and kind energy the second we met her, and she immediately validated our feelings, continually acted with a tremendous amount of compassion, and reassured us we were giving Ophelia the gift of peace by sending her across the rainbow bridge. She took her time to explain the process, and went at our pace every step of the way, making sure we were comfortable the entire time. We thought we’d feel strange crying in front of her, but she made us feel safe and secure in doing so. We will always remember her for how supportive she was and how she treated Ophelia with such dignity and love.
> 
> We HIGHLY recommend Lap of Love. Everyone we communicated with made us feel like we weren’t alone, and like they’d be there for us, no matter what. In our first phone call alone – a difficult call to make – we spent forty-five minutes asking questions, and didn’t feel rushed for a single second. Most importantly, our pet was able to say goodbye in a comfortable environment, giving her a peaceful transition to the other side. For that, we are eternally grateful.

> “Ruby absolutely loved car rides- except when they ended at the Vet’s office. When we learned about in-home pet euthanasia a few years ago, we knew when the time came that it would be our preference- and hers.
> 
> We fully understood the grief we would undergo, yet what we weren’t prepared for, was the amazing experience we would have with Dr. Holly. She responsively texted with us after business hours the night before, carefully learning Ruby’s medical history and the reasoning behind our choice to proceed with this heartbreaking decision.
> 
> When she arrived the next day, she immediately befriended Ruby, taking the time to learn her full history and getting to know the dog that we loved so much. Dr. Holly was attentive, even noticing the markings on Ruby, like the white tip of her tail. In her last moments, Ruby was at peace in her own home and in her own bed, while her family and new friend showered her with love and pets.
> 
> Dr. Holly took control of the entire situation while simultaneously giving us as much time with Ruby as we needed, stepping outside periodically to give us privacy. She thoughtfully explained how the procedure would work, step by step- including what we would expect at each stage of the process. Her expertise, guidance, and comfort meant the world to us during such a difficult time.”
> 
> Thank you, Dr. Holly. We will forever be immensely grateful for the kind and compassionate service provided.
