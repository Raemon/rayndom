# In Memory of “Angel”

“Angel”

“The hardest part of having pets is when the time has come to let them go. It’s a huge responsibility, but one I have always taken seriously with my many pets through the years. However, losing my sweet Angel was the hardest decision I’ve ever had to make. She was my “heart” dog, my “soul” dog. I’ve always taken my pets to the vet when the time has come for them, but I just couldn’t do that with Angel. I didn’t want her last memory to be of walking into a vet’s office, so I was happy to find out about Pet Loss at Home through my vet’s office, and arrangements were made for Dr. Carol Ong to come to my house. When I called her that it was “time”, she was able to come to my house later that same morning. She took care of arranging transport as well.”
