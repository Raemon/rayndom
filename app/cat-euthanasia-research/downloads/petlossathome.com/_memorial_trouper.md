# In Memory of “TROUPER”

“TROUPER”

“Our Trouper boy, as we spoke of him, was very small when he first arrived into our homes and our hearts. Not even 4 pounds he nonetheless was a bundle of energy!

That changed in the last year or so of his life. But his love of a cuddle was there until the very end. He was a “Federally Recognized Support Animal” for Jean and never left her side! He was with her everywhere ~ from doctor’s appointments to emergency room visits.

He loved to sit on John’s lap as he worked on the computer, concentrating very seriously on the monitor. But his favorite times with John were just being “guys” together and sitting in the big recliner and watching TV.

He didn’t like thunderstorms, fireworks, loud garbage trucks or lawnmowers that whined like an over-sized mosquito. Along with a good scratch behind his ears and a tummy rub; he loved cheese, peanut butter, pizza crusts and chicken nuggets. Also mashed potatoes, rice mixed with turkey burger and basically any other “real people” food he was allowed to have!

We were so fortunate that in 14 years we were never ever apart from him aside from a few overnights at the vet’s. When Jean had to stay in the hospital he would visit faithfully with John every single day. As he grew older he was the one that needed more emotional support and we were glad to provide it!

We were devastated when he was diagnosed with a collapsing trachea and nursed him through his final few months. Thank you to Dr. Holly Pietschmann  
(1-847-683-9640)  
for her compassionate help with his passing. He was able to pass on peacefully with us right by his side. We miss you so much Trouper, but we know we will be reunited! 🌈
