# In Memory of “Bailey”

“Bailey”

My baby girl, my Bailey. You are loved by so many creatures, both two legged and four. It is because of your silly soul, nurturing heart, wiggly moves, amazing underbite, the adorable way you talk at us. You are beautiful, you are my best friend. The world took you too soon, but with you, no amount of time would be enough. Please wait for Mamma and Winnie.
