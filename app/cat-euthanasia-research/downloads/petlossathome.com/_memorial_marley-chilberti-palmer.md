# In Memory of “Marley” Chilberti Palmer

“Marley” Chilberti Palmer

This is Marley our handsome 8 year old Golden Retriever. Dr Don Shields and his lovely wife Donna came to our home to put him to rest. They made a difficult situation a lot easier. He will forever be in our family’s hearts and we’ll miss him greatly. Our family is so thankful for this service and the compassion and professionalism they have shown us. I highly recommend this to service to those in need.

The Chilberti Palmer family
