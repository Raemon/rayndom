# In Memory of Leilani

Leilani

Leilani came to us as a 3-week old “rescue”. We carried her with us everywhere we went for 2 months, feeding her on demand with puppy formula. She truly became our girl, even sleeping with us every night. A little over 4 years ago she was diagnosed with a heart condition, so we medicated her daily and worked closely with our vet to manage her condition. But it caught up with her and she crossed the rainbow bridge at the age of 13 years 4 months. We will cherish every day we had with her and she will be in our hearts forever.
