# In Memory of Jazz Lesnick

Jazz Lesnick

Jazz was our almost 16 year old Golden Doodle. Words can’t describe the unbelievably positive effect that he made on family, friends, neighbors and really anyone who met him. His intelligence, sensitivity, energy and empathy were one-of-a-kind. We loved him as much as any other member of our family. He gave back so much to all of us. He will truly be missed for a very long time.
