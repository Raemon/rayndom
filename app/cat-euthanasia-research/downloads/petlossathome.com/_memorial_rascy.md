# In Memory of Rascy

Rascy

We made the very difficult decision to say good-bye to our sweet Rascy yesterday. Dr. Monica was so compassionate, Rascy immediately liked her and stuck his nose in her bag as he found the treats! As hard as it was, Dr. Monica talked us through the procedure and told us what to expect each step of the way. Rascy passed peacefully in my daughter’s arms. We love him so much and miss him desperately.
