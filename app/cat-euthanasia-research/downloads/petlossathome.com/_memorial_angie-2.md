# In Memory of Angie

Angie

Angie:  
I walked into my local animal shelter many years ago and saw this pretty little kitty sitting in a cage abandoned, injured and just getting over a surgery. My heart melted the minute she licked my finger through the cage door and I took her home a day later. I think we rescued each other. She brought me many years of happiness and she will be sorely missed. Special thanks to Dr. Christina Kincaide for making this entire experience a very special and meaningful event. I could not have asked for anything better than Pet Loss At Home. I am so grateful to have found this wonderful group of people.
