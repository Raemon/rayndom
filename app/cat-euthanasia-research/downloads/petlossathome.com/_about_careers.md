# Career in End-of-life: Veterinarian

Gentle veterinarians needed Nationwide – Partner with us.

## Do you have a sensitivity for helping families navigate end-of-life care?

Pet Loss At Home works with compassionate veterinarians who provide private pet euthanasia in the comfort of home. We use 30 different marketing methods to bring the pet owner together with you, the vet in the field. By us spending money and knowing what advertising works, we alleviate that headache from you so you can focus your resources and money elsewhere.

We work with new grads, retired vets returning to work, and vets wanting more appreciative clients that give hugs and send ‘thank-you’ cards. The more pet families helped means more income to pay for taxes, vehicle maintenance, supplies, and that “time-off destination” to recharge your batteries.

We are building Teams by adding veterinarians to each metro area so that clients get the help they need in a timely fashion. We currently have over 100+ vets helping thousands of pets and their families across the country.
