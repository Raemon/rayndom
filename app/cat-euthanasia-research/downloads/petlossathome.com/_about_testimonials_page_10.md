> “We had to say goodbye to our dear lab, today. She was very reactive and fear aggressive to other animals anf noises which made vet trips so stressful for her and us so we decided an in home visit would be best. Our girl ran up to Dr Carrie with her sister next to her side to say hello. She played with her new stuffy until the sedation kicked in and then slowly drifted off to sleep in the grass with us petting her. It was so, so hard to lose her, but the calm and peaceful way about her during the experience made it a little less painful. Thank you, Dr Carrie.”

> “Thank you Dr. Gail Larson for helping us say good bye to our dear Daisy. She was our Crazy Daisy and we needed her to have a calm and peaceful setting at the end. So happy you are part of this , much appreciated, service!”

> Thank you Dr. M’Risa Mendelsohn for your tender and loving care in helping our beloved Hoss pass peacefully and for helping our family through a horrible day. It hurts so bad to lose a pet but it is a great consolation that caring and dedicated vets such as yourself make it so your pet can pass peacefully at home surrounded by family. Thank you so much.

> “Dr. Cassie Schneller was a caring and compassionate practitioner who helped our beloved Oliver pass beyond his physical discomforts surrounded by his family. I highly recommend Pet Loss at Home when it is time to say goodbye to your own beloved pet.”

> “Dr. Rachel was an angel. She made a difficult journey much more bearable. You could immediately tell that she GENUINELY cares for the families and fur babies that she is helping. She offered us and our baby peace. Thank you Dr. Rachel.”

> “We had a very difficult decision to make for our Sammy. Dr Rachel was incredible during a very difficult time for us. She was patient, kind and listened to us. Her genuine concern during this time was of great support to us. Then to receive a card from her a couple of days later was a wonderful gesture that we were not expecting. We hope that we never have to make this decision again (but with 3 dogs, there will come a time) but would not hesitate to call on Dr. Rachel again. She was an angel when we needed it most.”

> “We want to thank Dr. Bingham for her kind and compassionate assistance when our beautiful girl Rosemary needed her help at the end of her wonderful life with us. Dr. Bingham came out on a Sunday evening, across town, within 90 minutes of my call for help. She was both professional and gentle and helped everyone in our family to understand and get through this painful process with her kindness.”  
>  Thank You!

> I cannot thank Dr. Christina Kinkade enough. She was so compassionate and caring. She answered the call and was able to be there for our Harley so he did not have to suffer anymore. It was so peaceful and calming having her. As much as my heart is completely broken over Harley, I know he is at peace. Thank you again for being there for us and him in his time of need.

> > Just wanted to pass along how wonderful Dr. Oleary was this past Sunday at our home helping us at this difficult time. She made the whole process so dignified and respectful, we truly appreciate everything that was done for us that day. Keep up the great work and I will most definitely pass on to whoever may need you guys in the future. God bless

> “Dr. Shields came when needed, Maggie’s time was becoming a time of suffering even as she still made the effort to faithfully follow me about.  
>  He was caring and gentle. My heart is broken but I know Maggie’s is at peace.  
>  Maggie was my 11 or 12 yr old American cocker rescue friend for 5 years who had been fairly stable with Cushings symptoms until her pituitary tumor grew. She was always within a few feet of me but never underfoot.”
> 
> Thank you Dr. Shield.

> Dr. Brian Arnold was the best we could’ve asked for. Our almost 2 year old puppy needed to be put down after his CKD caused a rapid decline in his condition. Dr. Arnold was able to be at our home in Napa in less than 3 hours from the time we called on a Monday night. Our baby boy was able to find peace at home with the help of Dr. Arnold. We were pleasantly surprised that after his passing Dr. Arnold made paw prints in clay, paw and nose prints with ink and paper and gave us a glass jar of some of his hair clippings. The whole process was so peaceful and Dr. Arnold made us comfortable and offered a lot of support and kind words. I would 10/10 recommend using Dr. Arnold if you ever have to help your animal pass peacefully at home. Thank you Dr. Arnold. You hold a special place in our hearts.

> “Thank you. We had our beloved kitty Minou euthanized yesterday by Dr. Rachel Thauberger. She arrived EXACTLY on time which was _**very much**_ appreciated. I will spread the word for how wonderful the experience was.”

> Dr. Dustin Durfee was able to help our beloved Newman make his transition peacefully at our home in his favorite spot on the back porch. He was so kind and comforting during this difficult time. I would recommend this service, and Dr. Durfee to everyone.

> “Dr. Bender was so professional and compassionate. She explained everything to me in advance and made this very hard time a little easier. She was very kind gave me time alone with my dog to say goodbye. I would highly recommend her she’s a wonderful person.”

> When it came time to lay my very best friend, Tucker Bear, to rest, I struggled with knowing if I’d made the right decision. I ultimate knew that the pain was too much for my boy to suffer through any longer but the thought of “the next step” of truly letting go terrified me. When we reached out to Dr. Brian Arnold he could tell that the situation was urgent and that our hearts too broken to make us wait even 1 more day. He came to us that very night and helped us through the process. The moment I met him I knew that he came into my life to make this decision just a tiny bit easier for Me. He was kind, compassionate and truly cared. He was professional and in his own gentle, with a refreshing twist of humor way, he explained what the evening would entail. Dr Arnold was truly a gift to us. When we couldn’t find a tennis ball to send with him (his favorite toy), Dr Arnold gave him one of his own. When I apologized to him for getting in his way, laying nose to nose with my boy in his final moments, he told me “You need to be right where you are for him and for you”. When I struggled to let him drive away, he patiently waited and told me he would wait as long as he needed to, until I was ready. And when I repeatedly apologized for crying, he told me it just showed how loved Tucker is and what a great Mommy I was. That is how kind he was to me and my family! From his arrival to our home, through the process of ending Tucker’s suffering, to the moment he returned my boy to us, he handled every step with care! As I told him, he will never truly understand what role he played for us that day. We are forever grateful! I would recommend the care of Dr Arnold to anyone that has to go through this unfortunate heartbreak! Thank you Dr Arnold!

> “I want to thank Dr. Amanda for her kindness and the gentle way she helped my beloved 16 year old Vinny get his wings. She made a truly heartbreaking day a little easier.”

> Dr. Darden and Pet Loss at Home was the best experience for this very difficult time in my family’s life. She exhibited such care, concern and professionalism. Thank you so much for the dignity that you have given us with this situation. I definitely recommend Dr. Darden and Pet Loss at Home if you find yourself in need of this service.

> Dear Dr. Danton,
> 
> Thank you so much for the beautiful card and Marigold seeds in memory of Rosie. Thank you for being with us during her last moments. We appreciate your kind and gentle acts. Not a day goes by that we don’t think of Rosie. We miss her.

> Best wishes – The Yu Family

> Deacon, my 11 year old Rottweiler was a therapy dog. He delighted in competing in Agility, Rally, Obedience, Barn Hunt, Lure Coursing in addition to glueing himself to my side constantly. His loving gentleness impressed all he befriended. Dr. Bender treated Deacon, my best friend with kindness and care. God Bless these vets as they not only give the animal mercy but us pet parents as well. I thank God that Deacon chose to share his life with me.

> Dr Kinkade came to our home today to help our 11 year old Harley cross over. It was an extremely difficult decision as he has arthritis so he was still enjoying some good days. We had been keeping track of his behavior so we could tell when the bad days started to outweigh the good and that had begun to happen pretty rapidly in the last couple of weeks. Harley is a very special dog , he has been nothing short of perfect since the day we adopted him at four months. It was incredibly important to us that we find the right person to guide this experience for him as even until his last breathe Harley deserved nothing shy of the very best. From the first phone call Dr Kinkade had a “ way “ about her. A very confident , comforting way. We knew right away that she was our girl. When she got to the house we met her on the deck and I reluctantly let my younger dog out to see who was here. We felt it was important to have her there but also because of her strung nature we were open to keeping her inside if she caused Harley any stress. Dr KinKade knew that we wanted her there and handled Blue with such calm and grace that she was able to stay with Harley until his last breathe. She seemed to be present when she needed to be and then somehow when we needed our time she seems to slip off into the background so we could grieve and comfort in what felt like total privacy. It’s a vulnerable time when you are losing a member of your family and having a stranger there seems like it could be awkward and uncomfortable , however , Dr Kinkade was the steady presence that we needed to be able to give Harley all of the love he deserved in his final moments here. She was peaceful and calm and authentic and genuine and so incredibly comforting. She took everything at Harleys pace and all tho she helps a lot of people and pets with this transition she made it feel like this moment affected her. Like Harley was important to her and that she truly wanted what was best for him. I am eternally grateful to her for what she gave us , for allowing our final moments with Harley to be just as beautiful as every moment before that. ❤️

> During the days when our fur baby’s (Sophie) health was quickly declining, she provided us with signs that she was able to see the “Rainbow Bridge” in the distance, and that she was ready to return to nature and roam freely with her friends. So the search began, and we were fortunate enough to entrust our baby’s final journey with Dr. Craig Prior. Dr. Prior is an empathetic soul who carefully guided us throughout the entire process. With Dr. Prior’s tender heart, our baby was able to peacefully transition from this earthly realm surrounded by loved ones into the spirit dimension where she will live forever without fear or pain. We highly recommend “Pet Loss at Home” to help with your loved one’s final walk and if you live in the Nashville area, you can certainly count on Dr Prior to be accommodating and responsive to your needs.

> We’re so pleased we opted for help from www.PetLossAtHome.com
> 
> Dr. Darden was amazing.  
>  Our 15 year old lab-mix Trigger had been struggling for the last year with worsening arthritis, seizures, and intense noise fears.  
>  He was otherwise happy and enjoying life but all of this changed when he appeared to have had a stroke and could not move. We waited and comforted him but after 24 hours he was in distress. We called Dr Darden at 7am and she was here before 9am.  
>  Trigger made his journey gently and we had time to be with him and comfort him along the way. The last thing Trigger would have wanted was to be carried to a clinical environment. He passed where he slept every night for the last 15 years surrounded by family that loved him and I cannot think of a better outcome for this difficult situation.  
>  Thank you Dr. Darden for your compassion and skill. It’s an amazing thing to be able to help people and their loved pets through all of this. Thank you so much!  
>  Your personal visit to deliver Trigger’s ashes today made me want to share our experience and recommend petlossathome.com.  
>  We’re going to spread his ashes along the routes we walked, the backyard he loved, and probably keep some as a small reminder of the great times we had with him.
> 
> Thank you!
