# In Memory of “Murphy” Gillespie

“Murphy” Gillespie

At an emotional time, this service stepped up and a made very bad day a little more tolerable. Dr. Robin Teague DVM treated me with compassion & professionalism. I was allowed to be with my best friend at the end of her life. My 14 year old Rotty mix was a true friend & will be missed. I simply wanted to recommend this service; if it is time to say goodbye to your pet, it is the best way to go.
