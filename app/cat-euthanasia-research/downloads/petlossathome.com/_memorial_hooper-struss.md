# In Memory of “Hooper” Struss

“Hooper” Struss

In Memory of Hooper  
Hooper was my best friend, companion and protector. My heart has been torn with his loss.  
Pot Belly’s make wonderful pets, and I was told that they rarely get sick, well Hooper got sick.  
If you are thinking of getting a Pot Belly as a pet, make sure you are out in the country with plenty of land for your Pot Belly to run and root. Make sure that you have a local vet that also does house calls.  
Also, there is no such thing as a Micro Pot Belly. They breed the Pot Belly’s as baby’s (which is not healthy)  
It just takes longer for your Pot Belly to grow to it’s full size. (which is/around 150 pounds) If you are considering a Pot Belly as a pet (they do make wonderful pets), please contact Ross Mills Farm.  
[rossmillsfarm.com](http://rossmillsfarm.com/) You may also contact me, Becky: [612-443-0637](tel:612-443-0637).  
Hooper loved music and to dance. He is now in heaven dancing and running in a field with plenty of soil for rooting. (pot belly’s most favorite thing to do)

Good Bye my Hooper Scooper Woopers,  
Mommy
