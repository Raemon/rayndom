# In Memory of “Deacon”

“Deacon”

Deacon, my 11 year old Rottweiler was a therapy dog. He delighted in competing in Agility, Rally, Obedience, Barn Hunt, Lure Coursing in addition to glueing himself to my side constantly. His loving gentleness impressed all he befriended. Dr. Bender treated Deacon, my best friend with kindness and care. God Bless these vets as they not only give the animal mercy but us pet parents as well. I thank God that Deacon chose to share his life with me.
