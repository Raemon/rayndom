# In Memory of “Mia Wilderman”

“Mia Wilderman”

“One’s heart is never whole again when losing a pet. Mia was a blessing and a love like no other. Her energy and kind soul will never be forgotten but missed every day. We know she’s running circles with her fur-sister Bailey just like they used to do. Figuring out how to live without you will be hard but we know you will feel our love just as much as we will feel yours! Forever in our hearts Mia!” XOXO
