# In Memory of Rocky

Rocky

Rocky was a big happy yellow lab, with an even bigger heart. We were blessed to have him as our family member for 14 years. Even in his later years, when arthritis was evidently causing him to limp, he still would find a tennis ball or a stick to play fetch….he loved tennis balls. He also loved to go for boat rides and feel the cool air on his face. He was a GREAT dog and was loved by soo many. We have lots of happy memories with him and we miss him dearly!
