# In Memory of “Daisy”

“Daisy”

“I just want to let you know we recently used Pet Loss At Home for the first time and found it to be a most wonderful experience. Our Daisy was on her favorite couch with her head on her Dad’s lap as she crossed the bridge – no fear or trembling. We have had 14 dogs and cats during our life and for those that needed euthanasia, the trauma of taking them to a cold, sterile vet clinic for their last moments still breaks our hearts. We wish we had known of the at-home option before. Thank you so much for creating and providing this service.”
