# In Memory of Cocoa

Cocoa

Cocoa,  
We hope that you are walking more than 8 times a day now with all those you love and got to meet again over the rainbow. We are sorry you had to suffer and that we couldn’t help you sooner but we were with you every moment until your last growl to make sure you were safe and at peace. We had to let you go because we know you were better off that way. We hope you know we love you and miss you everyday and every time the mailman visits.

Love,  
Annmarie, Mom, & Dad
