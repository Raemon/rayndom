# In Memory of Kitty “Kit Kat”

Kitty “Kit Kat”

Kitty “Kit Kat”

“She will be missed greatly by her family. Steve her father, was intended to be only for a short while as a foster, but her little paw prints left their mark on his heart and he learned he needed her as much as she needed him. She was the Queen of the house, having overseen many furry friends over the years. Mugen was her closest sibling in age and joined her as a kitten when she was well into adulthood. He taught her to trust again, and brought her much joy as her cat companion, he morns her greatly. Her dog siblings Amory and Gryffin will also miss her and her mischievous ways. She’s loved few but did so greatly and will be missed by them all, her mother Rebecca, father Steve and Dog siblings Amory and Gryffin as well as Tim, and Alex were great roommates who Kitty had the pleasure of knowing. She will run free with Spaz on the other side of the rainbow bridge.”
