# In Memory of Bailey

Bailey

She was my first dog. My companion of ten years. She and I were inseparable in many ways. She was so sweet, loving, playful, smelled so good all the time. Beautiful and shiny coat. My heart has been torn apart for her loss. I miss her so much. It is has been 3 weeks since she passed. I can’t breathe sometimes. but, We gave her the most beautiful loving life to her. That was our promise to her. Our puppy child. Rest in peace, my sweet girl.
