# In Memory of “Rocky” Tarantino

“Rocky” Tarantino

This is my Rocky. He was 16 ½ years old when he passed away Saturday 2-13-16. I have had my Rocky since he was 1 week old when I found him. Rocky was my best friend. I can still hear him calling Mom. Rocky had a mass in his belly that burst Saturday. I am lost, I can’t sleep. My husband is the same. Not many seem to understand. I can’t tell you how many people ask, ” are getting another one?” We can’t , my husband and I are in our late 50’s. We still have our 14 year old dog. But nothing can replace these children of ours. When Rocky’s brother Chaz passed a few years ago, we never ever replaced him, Chaz was 19, he too passed at home, he had congestive heart failure.
