# In Memory of “PINTA”

“PINTA”

My Pinta, was a rescue dog. She walked into a school I was working in and my life was never the same. She enriched my life for over 12 years. She was a fierce dog, who protected her loved ones and home. Her loyalty to me was beyond measure – as if she was saying Thank You for rescuing her. I loved her and she loved me. There is an empty space in my heart now but I know with all certainty that she will be the first thing I will see when I go to Heaven.
