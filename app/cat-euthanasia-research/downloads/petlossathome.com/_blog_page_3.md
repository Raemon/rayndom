# Private Pet Euthanasia At Home Nationwide

### [Dementia-like decline isn’t uncommon in aging pets](https://petlossathome.com/dementia-like-decline-isnt-uncommon-in-aging-pets/)

RememberPetLossAtHome.com co-founder, Rob Twyning, acknowledges there isn’t a precisely defined condition like Alzheimer’s when it comes to aging pets. “But that doesn’t mean it isn’t common.
