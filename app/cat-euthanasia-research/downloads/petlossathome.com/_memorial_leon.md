# In Memory of Leon

Leon

Our good dog Leon was put down yesterday. He was 12 years old and his hips got the best of him. We ultimately decided that his quality of life was declining. I took him for a long walk yesterday and gave him his favorite treat, a vanilla ice cream cone. Our Pet Loss At Home mobile vet, Dr. Karen Twyning, DVM, came to our house to euthanize Leon so he could be in the comfort of our own home. Below is a poem that I think speaks volumes of how amazing a dog can really be.
