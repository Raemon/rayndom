# In Memory of Scooter

Scooter

Scooter,  
You made me laugh or smile daily. You were a rescue dachshund, coming into our family in 2001, but from the very first day you and I had a very special bond. In 2010, when you were diagnosed with congestive heart failure, we became even closer as I took care of you. Your heart physically got larger and so did mine these last 7 years just knowing you. You gave me unconditional love, loyalty, laughter and you would defend me with your life..Little dog, big bark, big heart…It’s been a pleasure and an honor that you shared the last 17 plus years of your life with me. What a joy it’s been, thank you, thank you, thank you.  
I will remember you, celebrate you, honor you and keep you in my heart forever.  
I love you Scoot…
