# In Memory of “Frank”

“Frank”

To our Frankie Boy,  
“We knew this day would come eventually, but we never thought it would be this hard to say goodbye. You were the best part of our days, and things just seem a lot less exciting now that you’re gone. You left the biggest pawprints on our hearts, and no one can ever replace the love that you brought into our home. We know you’re no longer in pain, and are chasing all the squirrels out of the yard now. We love and miss you bubba, and we hope to see you again someday <3”
