# In Memory of Smokey

Smokey

Thank you so much for helping us through the process of saying goodbye to Smokey. Although we are still grieving his loss, we are comforted by the fact his passing was so peaceful and that he is no longer suffering from the cancer he bravely fought. We are so appreciative of your service and feel fortunate to have found your website which enabled all of us to avoid the veterinary office environment.  
Smokey along with his sister Ruby, who you met, provided us with so many happy memories. He was a very loyal companion and always wanted to be at our side no matter where we were. He always had a smile on his face which we will remember fondly along with the songs he sang with his sister.
