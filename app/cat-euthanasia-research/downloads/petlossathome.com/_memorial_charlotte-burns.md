# In Memory of “Charlotte” Burns

“Charlotte” Burns

Our beautiful girl Charlotte was our blessing and the light of our lives for nearly 15 years. We never, ever wanted to say goodbye. When we had no choice, we were so grateful and relieved to have Dr. Christina Kinkade come to our home and help Charlotte pass while in her favorite and most secure place, our bed. She was the most important creature in our lives and despite our heartbreak, we would go through it again to have her back for even a minute. We miss her love of us, her home, and her way of making us smile no matter what we were going through.  
A delight from beginning in end. You will never die in our hearts Charlotte. Never. Remember that nothing can break the circle. Not ever.  
Love, Mommy and Daddy.
