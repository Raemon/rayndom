# In Memory of “Chloe”

“Chloe”

“This is our sweet Chloe who was with us for 17 years. Unfortunately her quality of life was such that we had to send her over the rainbow yesterday, with the help of Dr Pietschmann. We will miss her a lot, we only had her for 17 years, which still is not enough, but fortunately she did have us for her whole life. I called her Glowworm!”
