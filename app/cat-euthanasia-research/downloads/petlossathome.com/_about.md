# About

## Pet Loss At Home connects pet owners with mobile veterinarians who have a special sensitivity for house call euthanasia. Choose to say goodbye in the privacy and comfort of home.

Rob & Karen Twyning

Pet Loss At Home was founded in 2002 by veterinarian, Dr. Karen Twyning. She was profoundly impacted after honoring the wishes of a client to euthanize her elderly cat at home. The experience was so very peaceful and beautiful, it is fixed in her memory. She left that home wondering, “Why is any pet euthanasia ever performed in a cold, sterile clinic?!”

Since then, she’s been on a mission. With the help of her husband Rob, Pet Loss At Home is making home euthanasia service much more widely available nationwide.
