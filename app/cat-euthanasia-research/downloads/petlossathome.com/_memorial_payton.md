# In Memory of “Payton”

“Payton”

“Our beloved Payton is no longer by our side but forever in our hearts. We were blessed to have been rescued by him and have him for 12 and a half years. Our handsome boy was a frequent ambassador to the rescue that saved him as we continued to pay if forward and volunteer to help other dogs in need including adding two more to our pack. He loved everyone he met and always had something to say when he did. Though we miss him terribly, we know he will always be with us in spirit. May you rest easy buddy and wear your silver harness with pride. We love you!”
