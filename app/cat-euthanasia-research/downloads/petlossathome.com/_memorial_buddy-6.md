# In Memory of “Buddy”

“Buddy”

“Buddy entered our lives in August 2009 and we were lucky to have him until his transition on his 16th birthday April 15th 2025. He was a beautiful dog who loved catching frisbees in the yard and chasing tennis balls. The neighbors dubbed him “The Mayor” as he sat on the yard and watched the world go by. He always wanted to be right by us day and night. I will forever miss his smile and loving licks. Thank you to Dr. Pietschmann for her compassionate help with his passing. He was able to pass on with us right by his side. You were loved and we will miss you forever.”
