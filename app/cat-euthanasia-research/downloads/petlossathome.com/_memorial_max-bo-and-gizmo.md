# In Memory of “Max, Bo, and Gizmo”

“Max, Bo, and Gizmo”

“I rescued Max the cockapoo first from a family that kept him in basement. Bo the boxer pit was rescued from two people who couldn’t take care of him & Gizmo (my old man) a Jack Russell Chihuahua mix was rescued while walking with Max & Bo, forever to be known as “The Boys”.”
