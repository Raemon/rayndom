# In Memory of Henry

Henry

“There are no words that can possibly express how deeply Henry was loved and how much he will be missed. We are so very grateful that “Little Man” was in the comfort of his home and in the arms of his Daddy when his family had to say see you later.

Dr. Holly was very compassionate, caring and respectful of the time we needed. We are thankful that those last moments were in the place Henry loved best – home. Henry loved being home with his pack – his Daddy, his Joyce and his Annie. He never liked going anywhere in the car.

We know that Henry is on Rainbow Bridge, playing with his Frosty, Princess and Sadie, waiting for the day he’ll be joined by those he loved and who loved him.”
