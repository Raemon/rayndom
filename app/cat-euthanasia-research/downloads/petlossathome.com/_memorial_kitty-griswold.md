# In Memory of Kitty Griswold

Kitty Griswold

Our darling Kitty Little, who we rescued from the rafters of a horse barn when my husband Marcus and I were still sweethearts in college, has set sail to join her Grammy and Grandma Jackie and all our beloved pets who went before her. She has seen us through our engagement, marriage, grad school, the births of our boys, the passing of our moms and eight household moves (to three states). She’s shared love and wisdom beyond anything we could have hoped for. Sweet dreams, Kitty. We love you. –Love, Mama, Daddy, Kai, Leif, and Jake
