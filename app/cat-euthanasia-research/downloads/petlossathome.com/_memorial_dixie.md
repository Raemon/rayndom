# In Memory of Dixie

Dixie

I met Dixie while volunteering at the SPCA. She and I connected right away and I could just tell she was a special cat. Dixie was the sweetest and most gentle soul. She loved to snuggle more than food and would rather sleep in with us than meow for breakfast! She was apart of our family for 13 years and was the best “big sister” to our two human children. We will miss her forever!
