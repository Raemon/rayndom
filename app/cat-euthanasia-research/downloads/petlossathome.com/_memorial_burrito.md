# In Memory of “Burrito”

“Burrito”

Burrito, a beautiful cat, you will always be loved by me. I will miss your crazy personality and all of the love you gave me, and I will never forget you. I know you are happy in Heaven now, with a huge bowl of fish, made just for you.

Rest in Peace, my baby Burrito.
