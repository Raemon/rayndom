# In Memory of Penny

Penny

She was our Nanny Dog. Always a protector and lover to my kids and I. Penny was our sweet and spicy fur baby. She loved her people, her food, her toys. She did all kinds of tricks, held her paws out like a lady for her nail trims. She LOVED her water and sprinklers in the summer. Penny has left an immeasurable hole in our hearts moving on to the Rainbow Bridge.
