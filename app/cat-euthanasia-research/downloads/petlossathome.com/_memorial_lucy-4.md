# In Memory of “Lucy”

“Lucy”

**I found Lucy when she was just a few months old, but I have always believed that she found me. She taught me how to love unconditionally. She taught me how to be a truly kind and generous human being. She moved to many homes with me and made the process so enjoyable. She walked with me and cuddled me every day. She used me as a pillow for many of her naps. She was sweet and loving to everyone she met. She sat with my friends, family, and me while we laughed and while we cried. She indulged my early mornings and random dancing. She was my soul’s child in a dog’s body. I miss her, and I love her so much. When it came time to make the very difficult decision to say goodbye, Dr. Allegra was very compassionate, supportive, and kind. She spoke with me on the phone and gave me all the information I would need. I will forever be grateful for Dr. Allegra’s helpfulness, gentleness, and kindness during this time.**
