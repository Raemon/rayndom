# Should I Put My Dog Down If He Is Still Eating?

## 

## **Does eating mean my dog is not suffering?**

Not always. Many dogs will continue to eat even when they are experiencing pain or discomfort. Appetite can remain strong because eating is a natural survival instinct. A dog may still eat while struggling with mobility issues, chronic pain, or other serious health conditions. Appetite alone is not a reliable indicator of quality of life.

For many pet owners, the question of “Should I Put My Dog Down” arises when they notice their beloved companion’s changes in behavior.

## **What are other signs my dog may be suffering?**

Look for changes beyond eating habits:

  * Difficulty standing, walking, or climbing stairs

  * Incontinence or frequent accidents in the house

  * Restlessness or inability to get comfortable

  * Loss of interest in play, walks, or family interaction

  * Whimpering, panting, or other signs of pain  
These changes can signal that your dog’s daily life is no longer enjoyable.

## **How do veterinarians decide when it’s time?**

Veterinarians often use a quality-of-life scale, sometimes called the **HHHHHMM Scale** (Hurt, Hunger, Hydration, Hygiene, Happiness, Mobility, and More Good Days Than Bad). By scoring each area, you and your vet can make a more objective decision. Even if your dog is eating, low scores in other areas may indicate that euthanasia is the most compassionate choice.

## **What is a quality-of-life checklist for dogs?**

A quality-of-life checklist helps families evaluate their pet’s comfort:

  1. Is my pet in pain?

  2. Can my pet move without difficulty?

  3. Is my pet still interacting with family?

  4. Are there more good days than bad days?  
These questions help balance emotions with objective signs of wellbeing.

## **Can euthanasia at home be less stressful for my dog?**

Yes. In-home euthanasia allows pets to remain in their familiar surroundings, avoiding the stress of a clinic visit. They can be surrounded by their family, favorite blankets, and familiar scents, making the process gentler for both pet and family.

## **What if I’m not ready to make the decision?**

It’s normal to feel conflicted. Talking with your veterinarian can help clarify whether your dog’s condition is likely to improve or worsen. Many families also find comfort in speaking with grief support counselors or pet loss support groups before and after the decision.
