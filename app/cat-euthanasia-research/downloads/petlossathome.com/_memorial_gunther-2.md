# In Memory of “Gunther”

“Gunther”

My beloved Gunther was a very shy older cat and his health declined quickly. As she was explaining how she going to administer the first sedative and what that would do, he actually put his head down next to her, as if he was ready, she noted that and it did bring me some peace.

As hard as it is to lose a pet, it must be hard to be the person to travel to homes to assist in transitioning a loved one from life to death and comfort the owners. She did it with such empathy and grace and I will be forever grateful to her, her presence made the experience much lighter and special. He was able to transition in the peace of his own home where he felt safe and loved.

Dr. Carrie was so patient and kind and explained the process to me in a very understanding way that helped put me at ease in a difficult and heartbreaking situation.
