# In Memory of “Elvis” Gladman

“Elvis” Gladman

“Elvis (aka Babykins) was the sweetest, gentlest, most loving kitty we could have asked for. He was our best friend and such an important member of our family. He went through so much with us – two overseas moves, the births of our 2 daughters… even when he went deaf he took it all in stride. Not one hiss, growl, or scratch in 19 years even when his tail was tugged or he got an extra strong hug. Since this past Sunday when he passed away peacefully, our hearts have been heavy with sadness. We don’t know how to move on after this. We can’t thank Dr. Allegra enough – every step of the way she gave Elvis the treatment he deserved. She gave us paw prints in clay to remember him by and left room for our girls to put their fingerprints next to his.”

Thanks again Dr. Allegra…
