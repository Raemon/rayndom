# In Memory of “Scruff”

“Scruff”

“Scruff was a handsome long haired kitty from Yorktown area who once lived on his own and had no fear of challenges including raccoons and other kitties. In his day, he was a large, muscular kitty who came along one day, and he chose and then adopted his family. He had a very long and good life with a very loving family. Today surrounded by his 3 cat siblings (Grey Boy, Jonesy and Fat Head) and his mom, sweet Scruff, peacefully transitioned to his next great kitty adventure. Rest in peace, sweet Scruff. You are missed.”
