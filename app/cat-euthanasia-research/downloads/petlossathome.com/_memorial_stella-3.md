# In Memory of Stella

Stella

She had the sweetest disposition and was more loving and loyal than any dog I’ve ever known.  
“Not the least hard thing to bear when they go from us, these quiet friends, is that they carry away with them so many years of our own lives.” – John Galsworthy  
Stella 2003-2019
