# In Memory of “Charlie” 4/17/10 – 6/28/21

“Charlie” 4/17/10 – 6/28/21

Charlie, words cannot describe how great your absence is felt. You were such a small dog but with a big spirit, and huge presence. You were more than our pet. You were family. We are torn to pieces over your departure, however we are comforted by the fact that you are free from pain and suffering. No words can describe what you’ve meant to us and how much we loved you. You’ve been a good boy and have brought us nothing but joy and laughter for 11 years. Now go and rest In peace baby boy, and just know you will be missed dearly. You were truly a special dog Charlie… You will ALWAYS be loved from the depths of our souls.

—Mommy, Nanny, and Leshyia♥️
