# In Memory of “Carson Lucas”

“Carson Lucas”

“Carson Lucas…8-2007 ~ 12-2020

You are my heart  And I will miss you always.

I thank you for spending your last hour in my arms. Those were always my favorite moments and we had thousands over the 13 years.

Thank you to my family who stood in my place as you ran across the rainbow bridge. My heart was with you even if my body couldn’t be, but you know that.

Thank you Dr. Ong for making his last moments peaceful.”
