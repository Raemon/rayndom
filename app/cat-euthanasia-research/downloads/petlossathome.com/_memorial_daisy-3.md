# In Memory of Daisy

Daisy

Our Daisy passed away on October 10, 2018 after brightening our lives for just over 16 years. This photo captures her vibrant personality and her beautiful smile. Among other things, she loved posing for pictures, chasing squirrels, and reminding visitors that despite her small Chihuahua size, it was SHE who ruled our house!

With help from Dr. Holly, she left this world without fear or pain. Instead, she was able to enjoy her beloved peanut butter as she left us. 

We will miss her always.
