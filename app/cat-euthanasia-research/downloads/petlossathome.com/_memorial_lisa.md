# In Memory of Lisa

Lisa

To my little baby Lisa:

Words can’t describe how much I miss you, all your funny little quirks &  
sounds.

All your playful gestures, scaring me as you so silently came around the  
corner.

Your lazy days lying in the windowsill sucking up as much sunshine as  
you could.

Your obsession with plastic bags, belly scratches or just curling up on  
my lap for a nap.

These are the thing I love about you, there will never be another Lisa!

I miss you so much but I know you are in a peaceful place filled with  
birds, butterflies & sunshine!

Your Dad
