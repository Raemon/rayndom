Coco Rodriguez

Ohhhh My Coco!!

May 23, 2002 – March 20, 2015

We had to let you go the first day of spring, Beautiful as always!! Such a good dog!! You leave us with the heart broken into pieces. We can only thank God for having had the opportunity to share our live with you for 13 years. Thanks for those fantastic 13 years with us. Thank you for countless happy moments. Thank you for being such a good friend to our children. Thank you for growing with them and thank you for teaching all of us patience, love and loyalty. We will never forget you my pretty Coquita Rodriguez, our house will not be the same without you in it! I can imagine the joy of seeing your cute face when we meet again. We will always love you!
