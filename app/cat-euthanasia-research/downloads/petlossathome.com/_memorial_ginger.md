# In Memory of Ginger

Ginger

Ginger was a tough spunky cairn terrier that has touched so many peoples heart. She lived an amazing 12 1/2 years and has seen many, many places. I am thankful for all of the borrowed time that we got with her and how she held it together to meet the baby. I will forever be grateful for her unconditional love that she had for me and my husband. There will be a big hole in my heart that can be replaced by nothing but her memories. We miss you terrible Ging!
