# In Memory of “Little Mamas” Dawson

“Little Mamas” Dawson

“Little Mamas was the smallest of a litter of 9 Border Collie Puppies that we bred. She was a sweetheart and one tough pup always keeping up with her family and always enjoying each day. Thank you so much for the year and a half you gave us of happiness.

Joe, Lacey, Daisy, Briggs, Belle, Smokey, Partner, Sebastian, Jax, Bear, Millie, Trip, and Stratton love you and can’t wait to see you again.”
