# In Memory of “Tao”

“Tao”

We lost our sweet boy to cancer on 11/30/2019, he was just 6 1/2 yrs old. Tao was a pure flat coated retriever. He brought us a lot of joy and happiness. Dr. Lead Osowiecki was kind, thoughtful, infomative and professional. Even though we didn’t want to let him go it was a comfort to watch him pass peacefully.
