# In Memory of “Bella”

“Bella”

“Bella was the heart, soul and mascot of our family. She warmed her way into every heart she met. She had a place at our kitchen table, whatever bed she chose to sleep on with whoever was in it and whoever’s lap she crawled into.. because she didn’t give you a choice and you just couldn’t resist. She loved to surprise you in the morning with snuggles and kisses and steal a sock when you weren’t looking. The way her entire body wagged when she saw you coming and the smile on her face made everybody fall completely in love with her! She will be terribly missed but always remembered .. The Roediger family was so proud to be party of “ Mate, it’s the Bella Fan Club” !!”
