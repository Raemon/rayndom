# In-Home Pet Euthanasia Services

# Compassionate Mobile Veterinarians Near You

**Pet Loss At Home** is a group of trained compassionate mobile veterinarians providing end-of-life care in the comfort of home. We are here for you and are a simple phone call away.

By being in the home, you and your pet will be surrounded by familiar sights and smells. Private house call service is priceless. The peaceful comforts of home help make your goodbye experience a better memory vs. a cold, sterile “Exam Room #2”. Honor the bond you have with your beloved pet. Consider this service a final act of love towards your beloved pet.

A home visit gives you plenty of time to meet the compassionate vet and talk about special stories and memories about your pet. Surround yourself with pictures, other pets who are friends, flower petals sprinkled in a heart shape, soothing music, wine, tea and familiar sounds and smells the pet is accustomed to every day of their life. Home is where the heart is.

## Typical Costs

Services include:

  * Phone/email consults about the euthanasia decision, quality of life discussions, signs of suffering infomation
  * Drive time to and from the home location
  * Home visit with handouts about memorialization ideas and grief support, sedation and euthanasia clay paw prints and fur clipping keepsakes
  * Home euthanasia service



Expect to pay approximately:

  * **$300-$450** if you keep your pet’s body for home burial or provide your own transport to a pet cremation facility
  * **$400-$650** if your mobile vet handles gentle body transport for group mixed cremation, ashes not saved or returned.
  * **$600-$850** if your mobile vet handles gentle body transport for individual cremation, with ashes saved and returned to you.



**Pet Loss at Home’s** mobile vet service costs more because it takes a lot more time. Consider a doctor has a vehicle, drive time back-and-forth, fuel, traffic, extended availability, short notice, long hours, 7-days a week, and large service areas. A vet clinic does not provide this level of service.

## Preparing for Pet Euthanasia at Home Services

Set aside two large dry towels and a blanket or bed sheet that the veterinarian can keep.

If your pet is still eating, set aside some extra-tasty food like lunch meat (or even milk/tuna for cats) for hand-feeding during sedation. There are no food restrictions before or during the home visit.

Options available:

  * **Location:** In the home or yard, at a park or beach setting? Which room, by the fireplace, floor, couch, bed?
  * **Atmosphere:** Consider lighting candles, playing relaxing music, laying out blankets and pillows, reading a poem or prayer.
  * **Who will be there:** Family, friends, neighbors, co-workers? College student Skype in or FaceTime?
  * **Keepsakes:** Do you want fur clippings or a paw print impression?
  * **Body care:** Burial (home or pet cemetary) or cremation (ashes returned or not). Transportation of body (you or the mobile veterinarian). Is there a special toy, blanket, drawing, letter, photo, or flowers that can be sent with your pet to be included in the cremation?



## What Happens During a Home Euthanasia

Pet euthanasia is a large overdose of anesthesia that is specially made for euthanasia. Your pet experiences a tired, relaxing, falling-asleep feeling.

First, a calming sedative is given. Peaceful relaxation and full unconsciousness set in over 5-15 minutes. Then, a second injection is given. Breathing stops within 30 seconds, followed by the heart slowing and stopping over 1-3 minutes.

Home visits typically last 30-60 minutes, but each visit is unique and tailored to the pet owner’s wishes and levels of service ordered. Please plan on at least an hour.
