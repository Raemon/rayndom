# In Memory of “Gunner”

“Gunner”

“Gunner (9) crossed the rainbow bridge Thursday, March 27, 2025 in the arms of his loving family. Born February 21, 2016, Gunner is the beloved son of Aubrey and Anthony, and brother to Jaydin.

Gunner was never far from his parents and made it his mission to be everywhere they were. Gunner was such a good boy who listened like a person, loved his dad, enjoyed playtime with his brother and was a fierce protector of his mom. He loved treats and would often sucker anyone into giving him more than he should have with his baby face. Gunner enjoyed running around after the horses, sun bathing under his tree, lounging next to dad on the porch while he enjoyed a cigar, following mom as she did yard work, running after Jay while on his bike, “Dane sitting” on surfaces and people, sucking on his blanket, his tug of war snake, burping in your face, car rides, walking adventures, zoomies outside especially in the snow, playing any sport that allowed him to steal the ball, creep/ peek and run, and being the infamous “poolside pup.”

In addition to his parents and brother, Gunner is survived by his grandparents Lila, Kim, and Wes, great-grandparents Maureen, DeWayne, Patricia, and James, Uncle Tuck, Aunt Samada, cousins Sydney and Lola, and many other family and friends. Waiting to welcome Gunner are his brothers Kobi George (cat) and Finnigan (guinea pig) with whom he shared a special bond.

The emptiness that has been left in our family is overwhelming. Gunner is truly loved and will be eternally missed.

Thank you Dr. Erin Moore, DVM for your compassion and care during our difficult time.”
