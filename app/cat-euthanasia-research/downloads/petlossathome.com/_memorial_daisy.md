# In Memory of Daisy Gosalvez

Daisy Gosalvez

It has been difficult adjusting to life without Daisy, but we love to remember her and she is a topic of conversation everyday. It makes me smile to admit that Daisy visits me in my dreams now. It’s an amazing feeling when she does. She is always radiant and happy.
