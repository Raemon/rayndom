# How Do I Deal With Pet Death?

Pets are more than just animals — they’re family. And anyone who’s ever lost a pet knows it’s terribly heartbreaking. Whether it’s your first time to lose a pet or your third, it never really gets easier, only more familiar. Thankfully, there are many ways to ease the sorrow and help you recover from such a devastating loss. If you or someone you know is suffering from the loss of a pet, then take a minute to read these seven tips to help you cope and return to a more peaceful state of mind.

## [Allow yourself to grieve](http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2010/11/06/on-mourning-the-death-of-a-pet/):

One of the most important things you have to remind yourself of following the loss of a pet is that it’s important and perfectly OK to grieve. Everyone grieves in different ways and for different periods of time. It may last a few days or a few years. Either way, it’s a completely personal experience that may require taking off work or spending some time alone to bounce back.

## [Express your grief openly](http://www.humanesociety.org/animals/resources/tips/coping_with_pet_death.html):

A big part of the healing process is expressing your grief openly. Don’t be afraid to talk about your feelings and memories. Holding it in will only make the grieving process more difficult and painful. This is especially important to remember when talking to your children about the loss of a pet. When explaining the situation, be sure to express your own grief and reassure your kids that it’s OK to be sad and that you also feel the same way.

## [Spend time with your surviving pet](http://www.humanesociety.org/animals/resources/tips/coping_with_pet_death.html):

Spending time with your surviving pet can help you cope with grief and ease the pain of losing an animal. Surviving pets may need a lot of TLC at this time because they are also affected by the loss. Even if they weren’t close, your surviving pet may whimper and act lethargic because they are distressed by the sudden changes. Comfort your surviving pet and try to create a positive emotional state within the home.

## [Do something in your pet’s memory](http://www.oprah.com/relationships/Dealing-with-the-Death-of-a-Pet):

Whether it’s spending time at the park where you used to walk your dog, volunteering at an animal shelter, or making a donation in your pet’s memory, these special moments can help you turn a painful situation into a positive one. If you like to write, paint, or make music, you can dedicate it to your beloved pet.

## [Keep a journal](http://www.marthastewart.com/921705/saying-goodbye-your-pet):

Keeping a journal is one of the best things you can do to record your feelings, thoughts, and memories about your pet and keep track of your grieving process. Doing so will help you work through the grief and make sense of the things happening around you.

## [Memorialize your pet](http://www.petfinder.com/pet-care/honoring-your-pets-memory.html):

Memorializing your pet can help you overcome your loss and remember the good times you had together. You can have a memorial for your pet in private or with the company of friends and family. Some people write a letter to their pet or create a photo album and leave it by an urn or their pet’s burial spot. You can memorialize your pet on his or her birthday or anytime you feel like reminiscing.

## [Seek support](http://vet.osu.edu/assets/pdf/hospital/companionAnimals/HonoringtheBond/CopingWithLossFactSheet.pdf):
