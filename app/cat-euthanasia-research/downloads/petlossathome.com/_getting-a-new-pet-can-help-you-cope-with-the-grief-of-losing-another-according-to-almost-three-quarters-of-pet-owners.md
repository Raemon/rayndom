# Getting a new pet can help you cope with the grief of losing another, according to almost three quarters of pet owners

Navigating the loss of a beloved pet can be a profoundly challenging experience for any pet owner. The emotional bond shared with these furry companions often makes their passing particularly difficult, as many find themselves grappling with the reality that they may outlive their cherished animals.

In the wake of such a loss, individuals approach the idea of welcoming a new pet in various ways. Some prefer to take their time before bringing another animal into their lives, feeling that this pause allows them to honor the memory of their previous pet and avoid any feelings of replacement. Conversely, others find solace in adopting a new pet sooner, believing that doing so can provide comfort and aid in the healing process.

Recent research highlights that a significant number of pet owners—nearly 75%—believe that bringing home a new animal has helped them manage their grief. While some individuals may choose to adopt a new pet within just four weeks following the loss, many others opt to wait at least a year, reflecting the varied ways people cope with their sorrow.

Interestingly, over 40% of pet owners reported acquiring a new pet before the loss of their existing one. This proactive approach can help mitigate feelings of anticipatory grief. Among those who adopted a new pet in this manner, more than half felt that the transition was positive, although nearly 20% noted that their older pet struggled to adjust to the newcomer.

In some cases, the decision to adopt another animal arises from unforeseen circumstances rather than a deliberate choice. For many, the motivation stems from a desire to provide companionship for their aging pet, while others simply wish to ensure that their home remains filled with the joy of a pet.

It is essential to recognize that the impact of losing a pet can extend beyond humans. Many owners observe signs of grief in their surviving animals, with approximately 60% noting behavioral changes in their pets following the loss of a companion.

When considering a new pet, many individuals gravitate towards familiar breeds. Popular choices for dogs include mixed breeds, Labrador Retrievers, and German Shepherds, while cats often chosen are mixed breeds, domestic shorthairs, and domestic longhairs. Interestingly, some pet owners even explore the option of bringing home a different species altogether, demonstrating the diverse ways in which people seek to fill the void left by their departed companions.

Ultimately, the journey of grief is unique for each individual and their pets. Finding ways to cope, whether through the adoption of a new animal or other forms of support, is a personal decision that can lead to healing and renewed joy in the companionship of pets.
