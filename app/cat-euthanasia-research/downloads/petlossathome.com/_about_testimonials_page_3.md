> “Dr. Leverone was kind and gentle in the facilitation of a peaceful death for our beloved dog Rove at our home. Rove’s last experience was not the utter terror of going to the vet, and for that I am forever grateful.”

> “Pet Loss at Home is a wonderful service. I highly recommend it. It was lovely to be able to say goodbye to our best boy, our 22 year old orange tabby cat named Big Jim, in the comfort of our own home. Dr. Tammy from Pet Loss at Home was so kind and patient with us during this very difficult time. She explained the whole procedure and even shaved some hair off of him for us. She played with my other cat and kept her calm as well. It was the most beautiful thing to be able to have him spend his last hour of life in his favorite sunny spot on the porch.”
> 
> Thank you so much, Dr. Tamara Padgelek. ❤️

> “We used Pet Loss to put our beloved dog to rest. They were able to help us on the same day we called. Dr. Bender was extremely kind, compassionate and competent. She took her time to talk with us and walk us through the process. Our dog went peacefully in the comfort of our home. Highly recommended.”

> “On October 20, Dr. Shields assisted our sweet fur baby, Plato, to doggy heaven. He made us feel so comfortable. He let us know exactly what he was doing, he did not rush us and told us wonderful stories, which really helped to keep us calm. Dr. Shield’s bedside manner is awesome. We truly think he is the best vet ever!!! Thank you so much, Dr. Shields.”

> “Our family used your service in July 2024 to put our pet Sookie to sleep. What a wonderful service you offer. The entire process was so peaceful. The vet was Maryann Bender, and she was so thoughtful and explained the entire procedure. She let us take as much time as we wanted to say good-bye to Sookie. I know of three other people who used your service and Maryann, and they all had the same comment. Thank you again for making a very difficult time alittle easier.”

> “We had to say goodbye to a beautiful soul our cat squidly. As hard as it was and is,Dr scutt made us feel sure it was the right thing to do and she was so patient and compassion. I do recommend pet loss at home, no stressful drive just spending time with her in her comfort place.”

> “We were fortunate enough to have our cat for eighteen years. My kids have never known life without him. While it was not hard to make the decision to let him go at the very end, it didn’t make the loss any easier. Dr Ong was incredibly patient with us despite a lot of messy tears, and while she was efficient we didn’t feel rushed in any way. I felt so grateful to have her take us through this very painful moment. I also appreciated her very transparent fees and found her services to be extremely reasonably priced compared to some other options in the area. I would recommend Dr Ong without question to anyone facing this difficult moment.”
> 
> Thank you, Dr Ong.

> “This week I had to say goodbye to my companion of 22 years, my Nala kitten. She was a very particular cat, I was the only human she liked, we understood each other. I gave her as much love as she wanted and made sure she had her own space whenever she needed it. I am grateful to. Dr Leverone for helping me through this painful process. He was a very calming presence for me and Nala and was gracious enough to give me some time with my kitten after she was gone.”

> “We had to say goodbye one of our dogs this morning and we’re incredibly grateful for the compassionate care provided by Dr. Carrie from Pet Loss at Home. She was extremely gentle and her empathetic approach made an incredibly difficult situation more bearable. The option to put him down in the comfort of his own home was invaluable. Dr. Carrie allowed us to take all the time we needed to say our goodbyes in our own way, which meant so much during this emotional time. She made sure that he felt safe and comfortable in his final moments, giving him a peaceful and respectful end. Her kindness and professionalism truly made a difference, and I highly recommend her services to anyone facing the loss of a pet. She also provides an on the spot paw print and offered to contact our vet the next day to inform them of his passing for you. They also allow you to get their ashes back which is a very nice option as well. I’d never return to a clinic for this again as long as I have the option.”

> “Gail recently visited my home and assisted with my cats end of life. She was very kind and helpful. She even did ink paw prints on top of a clay impression and I personally loved how they turned out. I highly recommend this team.”

> “Words cannot even begin to express how thankful I am for Dr. Holly Pietschmann. When we head to say goodbye to our baby, Tux, she was the only one to answer our call. We wanted to say goodbye at home instead of the vet’s office and Holly made that happen. We were able to take our time and say goodbye instead of being rushed.”
> 
> Holly we can never say thank you enough, you’re a true angel.

> “We wanted to send a thank you to Dr. Phil Whisnand. We had to make the very difficult decision to let go of our beloved dog, Carmela. We didn’t think she would make it another day without great pain and Dr. Whisnand was able to fit us into his very busy schedule. Dr. Whisnand was so kind and compassionate. Carmela’s death was so peaceful, we could not have asked for a better experience. We were able to lay beside Carmela as her heart slowly stopped beating and she took her last breath. The home euthanasia was a much better experience than it would have been on a cold hospital table. Dr. Whisnand treated Carmeal and our family with great respect from the moment he walked in the front door of our home, until he placed Carmela’s body on the stretcher and transported her to the funeral home/crematory. We even received a condolence card from Dr. Whisnand a few days later. Dr. Whisnand is an angel here on earth and we will gladly recommend Dr. Whisnand’s services to anyone facing the same difficult decision. We miss our baby every day and don’t think our hearts will ever heal, but knowing Carmela’s last moments on earth were so peaceful is a great comfort. Thank you again, Dr. Whisnand and May God Bless You.”

> “It was time to face the heartbreaking moment of saying farewell to my beloved companions, Milo, 17, and Steve, 14, my precious dogs. My heart was heavy with the worry of navigating the costs of having this painful goodbye in the comfort of our home, and everywhere I searched seemed to point me towards the sterile confines of a clinic. But then, like a beacon of hope, I discovered “pet loss at home.” The price was only slightly more than what I had feared at the veterinary office, and in that moment, I felt a flicker of relief.
> 
> Then I found Dr. Robin Teague. In a time when I was bracing myself for what felt like an insurmountable loss, he arrived like a guardian angel. Dr. Teague turned what could have been an agonizing experience into something profoundly compassionate and serene. When he stepped into our home, it felt as if an old friend had walked in—someone we hadn’t seen in years. The dogs, in their own way, were still reserved, but Dr. Teague stood with a calm assurance, giving them the space they needed. Then he simply sat down, propping his feet up, and began to speak to us as if we were family.
> 
> In no time, the atmosphere lightened, and I watched as my boys began to relax, comforted by his presence. Dr. Teague understood instinctively how to approach each of them, tailoring his care with such grace that it was as if he had known them their whole lives. His ease made all the difference—a true testament to his dedication and love for animals.
> 
> Thanks to the gentle, respectful guidance of Dr. Robin Teague, my sweet boys were able to leave this world with the dignity they deserved. I am filled with gratitude, knowing they are now at peace. Thank you from the depths of my heart, Dr. Robin Teague! Your kindness in our darkest hour is a gift I will forever cherish.”

> Hello Mr Twyning,
> 
> “I located your email address on the Pat Loss at Home site and I am hoping this email is being sent to the correct contact.
> 
> I had an in-home euthanasia service performed yesterday for my cat Meesha by Dr Christine, and I have to express how absolutely amazing she was. She made a horrible event just a little bit easier and less painful to have to endure. She was very compassionate, was so sweet and loving towards Meesha, and was so patient with me as well. Before she did the paw prints, she clipped Meesha’s nails and cleaned the paws, and even wrapped her with such an obvious reverence after she was gone in the blanket that I buried her in.
> 
> She’s truly an angel and I just want to express my extreme gratitude of her and wanted you to know as well.”
> 
> Thank you for providing pet parents this at home option for such a tough decision,
> 
> Sarah Fields

> “Dr. Mary Ann Bender I cannot thank you enough for your kind and soothing soul in our time of need. Thank you for being so willing and doing your absolute best to help Reva and us on such short notice. Thank you so much for taking such gentle care of her and making the process as tender as possible. We are so grateful that you were a part of helping our sweet girl cross over. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.”

> “Thank you Dr Ong for answering our call. You made the process easier to make a hard decision. We did not want to take our Great Dane Blu to the vet on his last day. At his age, it was hard for him to get in the truck. It was a blessing for him to be at home in comfort with the people and animals he loved. Your kindness and sincerity will never be forgotten. Keep up the good work.”

> “As many people know, sometimes you just have that animal. That special one that you bond with. Mine was nova. He was my soul dog. And I was his human. My heart was broken and still is. We said good bye to our sweet boy Nova and we were so pleased with Dr.Christina Kinkade from the moment we were texting her heart was kind. She walked through our door with kindness and it was REAL! She treated my boy with compassion as if it was her dog. The experience was so sad but she made us so comfortable every step. She spoke with my kids about what to expect. We weren’t rushed at all. She didn’t say one word about ok it’s time. She let us just lay with him and cry. She made us also feel like she had compassion and this wasn’t about a cost. It was about kindness and she felt the sadness we felt. But kept it professional. She was honesty the blessing we needed when we were broken. She treated our boy with respect from the minute she came in our home until the minute she took him with her. Everything was honestly was the way we wanted it. If anyone has doubts about doing this at home , I promise you Dr. Christina will help guide you through it all. She honestly was such a kind hearted person my family and I are blessed we had her to lay our sweet boy to rest. 🩷thank you so much Christina. You are what angels are made of. This is our tribute to nova.”

> “Dr. Larson was so wonderful when it quickly came time for our Dog Penny to go. She called back right away and was at our house within a few hours. She was so kind and gentle and explained how the process works. I am so grateful that we were able to do this in the comfort of our home while our dog could lay on the couch and go to sleep. Thank you for your services! It means everything to us!”

> “A client in Pleasant Prairie said Mary Ann Beckman (Our Call Center) was ‘very professional, helpful, & compassionate … very pleased with the interaction.” – Dr. Monica Inniss
> 
> “Keep up the great work, Mary Ann.” – Rob

> Rob Twyning – Owner and the Team of Veterinarians

> “Dr. Abby Regner’s was very kind and compassionate. She came to the house, explained everything to us made sure we were comfortable and more importantly that our boy Cobe was comfortable the whole time as we said goodbye to him.”

> “We new it was time for our sweet Slater was ready to cross the rainbow bridge, but we were not. Rescuing a pet and doing everything you can to give quality of life is fullfilling and he certainly had his surgeries and medication regimens but there comes a time when their quality of life is absent. We could see Slater was miserable, sad, despondent and tired. After reviewing our options and talking with our local vet who had cared for him for years, we were given guidance to call Pet Loss at Home. I cannot tell you how hard it was to make that call, but Dr. Alicia was superb. She gave great, straightforward advice to help us make the right decision. We were able to be with Slater at home, in his comfort zone and Dr. Alicia was so patient with us. She was compassionate beyond expectations and helped us through the whole goodbye process. In the end, we know we did the right thing by Slater by giving him good legs and a strong body to cross over. We recommend this service to all.”

> Dr. Teague is a blessing.  
>  My 15 year old Beagle was unable to stand on his own, not eating or drinking water.  
>  We decided that it was time for Bob to not suffer any longer so we contacted Dr. Teague.  
>  Dr. Teague came to our home made friends with Bob explained the procedure to me and then let me and Bob have quality time together. The procedure evolves 2 shots. The first shot relaxes the pet, second shot puts the pet to rest. In between the shots is for the quality time. For me seeing how Bob was in his last few minutes very peaceful. I highly recommend Dr. Teague . Your last moments with your pet will be comfortable for both of you. Thank you Dr. Teague.

> “I had the sad choice of having to have my pets put down, they came to my home, and were wonderful and compassionate, they were wonderful, cannot say enough wonderful things about these veterinarians….”

> “I had scheduled time for my husky, Noah, as I saw his decline, but he turned quick and Dr. Donna O’Leary was able to come days ahead of schedule and allow him to find peace and avoid suffering. I will be forever grateful to her for her kindness and compassion. She led us through the process with great care and I highly recommend her to anyone who would like their pet to away at home.”
