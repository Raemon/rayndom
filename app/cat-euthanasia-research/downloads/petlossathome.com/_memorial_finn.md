# In Memory of “Finn”

“Finn”

All love and freedom to my dearest son, Finn macCumhaill, as we bow to him on the eve of his death. Finn fought a valiant and stoic battle against myeloma for more than a year, but in the end his body needed more rest than he could give it alone. Family ambassador, charmer of every visitor, and lover of all living things, especially flies, plants he shouldn’t eat, walks in the buggy, and me. You are fiercely missed and deeply cherished. We are forever changed having Finn as our guide for almost 13 years. May the wind be at your nose and the sun on your back forever now, my dearest boy. I will find you in your meadow some day, where we will nap together forever.
