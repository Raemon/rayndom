# In Memory of Jen & Mason

Jen & Mason

The best friend a man has in the world may turn against him and become his enemy. His son or daughter that he has reared with loving care may prove ungrateful. Those who are nearest and dearest to us, those whom we trust with our happiness and our good name may become traitors to their faith.

The one absolutely unselfish friend that man can have in this selfish world, the one that never deserts him, the one that never proves ungrateful or treacherous, is his dog. A man’s dog stands by him in prosperity and in poverty, in health and in sickness. He will sleep on the cold ground, where the wintry winds blow and the snow drives fiercely, if only he may be near his master’s side. He will kiss the hand that has no food to offer. He will lick the wounds and sores that come in encounter with the roughness of the world. He guards the sleep of his pauper master as if he were a prince. When all other friends desert, he remains. When riches take wings, and reputation falls to pieces, he is as constant in his love as the sun in its journey through the heavens.

If misfortune drives the master forth, an outcast in the world, friendless and homeless, the faithful dog asks no higher privilege than that of accompanying him, to guard him against danger, to fight against his enemies. And when the last scene of all comes, and death takes his master in its embrace, and his body is laid away in the cold ground, no matter if all other friends pursue their way, there by the graveside will the noble dog be found, his head between his paws, his eyes sad, but open in alert watchfulness, faithful and true even in death.

On Saturday, February 12th, 2011, Mason left us and moved on to a better place. For some, his size alone was cause for fear and apprehension. However, for many, he was seen as a gentle giant…a lover and a protector. But for one, he was her best friend and most important part of her life. As most of us witnessed, it seemed no dog had ever been loved more by their master, nor master loved by her dog, and that was Jen & Mason. As Jen continues the next chapter of her life without Mason in body, he will be forever loved and missed. Bless you both for showing the rest of the world how to love so compassionately.
