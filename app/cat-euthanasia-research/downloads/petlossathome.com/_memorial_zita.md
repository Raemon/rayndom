# In Memory of “Zita”

“Zita”

“Today we lost our sweet baby girl, Zita. We were blessed to be your parents for 13 1/2 years. You gave us unconditional love and joy every day. You left paw prints on our hearts and will forever be missed. In gratitude for everything you gave us. We love and miss you so much. Mom & Dad.” XOXO
