# In Memory of Madison Mikula

Madison Mikula

Madison’s Poem  
February 5, 2015 was one of my worst days.  
Madison and I went our separate ways.  
Unable to walk, unable to run.  
Unable to rest when she was done.  
My heart screamed, NO!  
I knew it was time to let her go.  
The call was placed to the vet.  
Who came to my house to release my pet.  
Tears my in eyes, a pain in my heart.  
Ending her suffering was part.  
No more pain, she is free.  
Waiting by the Rainbow Bridge for me.
