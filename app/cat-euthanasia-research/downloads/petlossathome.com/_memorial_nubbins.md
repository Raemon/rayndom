# In Memory of Nubbins

Nubbins

GRANTVILLE, GEORGIA. My husband and I are extremely grateful to Dr. Alicia Darden for her generosity and compassion. Since our dog, Nubbins was in too much pain for us to try to move him, we felt the right thing to do was to euthanize him at his home. Since his inability to walk by himself was so sudden, we had very little time to find somebody to help us manage this situation. We called several other services prior to getting in touch with Dr. Darden. Once we talked to her, she drove an hour and a half late on a Tuesday night to put our precious dog out of his pain. Dr. Darden went above and beyond to be helpful in every way and based on our experience with Dr. Darden, we will absolutely recommend her to anybody that has the difficult decision to make to say goodbye to a dearly loved pet. Thank you so much.  
Sincerely,

KAREN PAINTER
