# In Memory of “Midnight” Hewitt

“Midnight” Hewitt

“A pet is never truly forgotten until it is no longer remembered”.  
Rest in Peace Midnight – 5/15/94 – 1/30/16.  
We would personally like to thank Dr. Rachel Thauberger ([Petlossathome.com](http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2FPetlossathome.com%2F&h=yAQGfCqJRAQFY_uQKHvq82N1egyuZDmDxH2mS646qAKJPxA&enc=AZNEmd3DF6k6Rf3HedMl8EF_5FNyGjgnHty4Gkew2jYs5soZcUKyw_rHDWME8YHzqvRtgadcUOcBz1Lu0YTuwDnUMiZt8OzcLhIPC2FInVot_gW-xNqc8WcvaLwnBq_hX-Dg-Or8RkZywouuFGr2zgZMrfTpNjibq4RK1dRhl4NvWNHEaP7yh9hANnckO0os1mY&s=1)) who came to our home to assist Midnight in passing from this life to the Rainbow Bridge. Dr. Rachel was compassionate and comforting, and her skills were excellent. She allowed Midnight to pass with the people he loved. Dr. Rachel treated us and Midnight with respect and support, Midnight was treated with dignity even after his passing which meant so much to us.  
Jane and Carl
