> I want to thank Christine for responding so quickly to my email when I asked for help. I spoke with her on the phone and she was so kind and explained everything in a way I could understand. It’s Sunday and they were able to come within a few hours to help end the suffering of my 11 1/2 year old boxer. He was my baby. He took a turn for the worse over night and this morning we knew he couldn’t suffer anymore. Dr. Dan Clayton came to my home and he was so kind and gentle. He explained what he was doing and let me hold my baby while he was going to sleep. It was very peaceful and I’m sad but relieved. I appreciate them and this organization. It was a great experience with them for such a terrible time.

> Thank you for the message, and thank you again for fitting us in last minute. We love dogs and plan to have many more; though with this joy comes tough decisions like we had to make today. If we find ourselves with a similar need many years down the road, your business card will be our first call. Thank you again.

> Thank you so much Sandra for your compassionate kindness and thoughtful words. You made a huge difference in a difficult time and I can’t thank you enough. It will be difficult, it always is. Just takes some time to heal. There will be another wonderful pet needing a good home tho and I will happily give them my love. They all deserve love and a good home. Thank you again for being so amazing and caring in what you do. Always, Judy ❤️ 🐶

> Sandra, we would like to thank you for what you did for us yesterday. I now cannot imagine having Koda’s passing happen any other way. He left without stress and had his people with him in one of his favorite spots at home. For us, it was so very sad yes but, at the same time beautiful. I know you probably understand. Again, thank you for your caring heart, gentle nature for Koda and us and your true professionalism. You are truly a good person. Be well Sandra and blessings to you. Jeff & Kim.

> Thank you, Sandra. I’m so thankful for you. I wouldn’t have thought to give him ice cream but I can’t explain the comfort it gives me knowing in his final moments the pain subsided and he felt very rewarded for a life well lived. 💞

> Thank you for your kind words. You made something so incredibly hard, beautiful.

> Dr. Holly made our difficult day as calm and peaceful as possible. She was professional, kind and very patient as we said goodbye to our sweet girl. Thank you Dr. Holly 💗

> We would like to thank Dr Ken Simpson for being so kind and understanding when came to our home to put our beautiful Zoey to sleep and took away her pain. We cannot thank him enough. He is truly an extremely kind and compassionate person.

> I do appreciate your deeply compassionate care for my girl And for your kind words for me as I was worried about how I’d handled it- like I’m sure many others feel, I wish I had one more day with her Warm regards – Cynthia

> ‘Thank you so much Dr Coon, Joan and I really appreciate how thoughtful and professional you have been while helping us through all this “

> Jamie came to us from a kill shelter, starved, shutting down, unresponsive to the people there, and full of scars, so a call out on Facebook was sent to see if anyone was willing to take him home and see if he would come around. From the first moment I saw his picture I was in love, there was just something about him. When he finally came out of his shell, Jamie was the most goofy, loving, and brilliant soul I have ever had the honor to know. He loved life, from hiking and playing at the barn, to snuggling on the couch with us and his favorite teddy bear. He was also an expert bed hog! A piece of my heart flew away when he left us. Hail our little traveler until we meet again. I will be forever grateful to Dr. Pietchmann for the gentleness and support she showed when we had to put Jamie down.

> My friend recommended Dr. Durfee to help us cross our beautiful Bailey girl over to the rainbow bridge. I sent him a text on a Thursday afternoon and he came that evening. He showed sympathy, listened to what we wanted/needed, was extremely respectful and patient, gave us as much time as we needed alone with her, explained the process, allowed us to ask questions, answered all of our questions, and demonstrated so much care for her and us. He made the most heartbreaking experience peaceful. He has text back and forth with us since that day to answer questions and help us grieve. No words can express our gratitude. Thank you, Dr. Durfee!

> Thank you Dr. Coon. You made his passing peaceful for both he and I. I miss Tux’s presence and caring for him terribly. He was my strength and partner for a over a decade. I am so grateful to have had his devotion. We had a great run together and used our time together to the fullest. He will be in my heart forever, never replaced. Maureen

> Thank you so much Sandra. She’s been buried at her home under a beautiful cherry blossom tree. We rescue and love a lot of kitties in need now and I’ll definitely keep you as my number one contact for these hard times, as well as refer all my friends. I really appreciate how quickly you were able to come out. I was so afraid I’d have to take her out of her comfortable place so she didn’t keep suffering. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

> On August 17, 2019, we had to say our final goodbyes to our forever faithful Cocker Spaniel, Rocco. At 16 1/2 years of age, he lived each day as best he could. Rocco suffered from kidney disease, high blood pressure and overall old age. Rocco gave us many years of unconditional love….It wasn’t easy to let him go, but we knew it was time. Many thanks to Dr. Shields for helping us make that final difficult decision. God Bless <3

> I can’t thank Dr. Durfee enough. I called Monday morning as my cat was rapidly declining and suffering. Durfee was busy all day but he came by after he was done even though it was later. Even though I’m sure it was a long day for him he still cared to help us and do everything he could. When he arrived he was very peaceful and calm. He explained to me what to expect and everything he did was with so much care. My kitty peacefully passed away in my arms and I know with 100% certainty that this was the way to do it. Afterwards, Durfee said if I needed to talk to someone he was available. Thank you so much for your compassion and help through this difficult process.

> Dr Kincaide:  
>  Today was a very hard day for us, but we will always be so appreciative of you moving your schedule and coming to our home on a Sunday so our dog wouldn’t suffer.  
>  With all the bad news in our world thank goodness for people like you who care for our pets and us as well.  
>  Thank you so very much,  
>  Bonnie and Pete Lutze

> On Friday, September 27, our 15 year old Bogey was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer and he was in pain. The cancer diagnosis was heartbreaking. There was one recommended last effort which was an aggressive round of steroids. By the middle of the night we knew that was not going to work and we were going to have to say goodbye to ensure he did not suffer. Dr. Christine Scott came to the house Saturday afternoon. She was so caring and professional and talked us through the entire procedure. Bogey peacefully left this life surrounded by his family (both human and animal), which was amazing. I can’t say enough about Dr. Christine and her compassion. It was such a caring experience from start to finish and if you have to lose a pet, this is the way to do it — in a quiet environment they are loved in and not in a cold office surrounded by loud noises and fear.

> It’s taken me a very long time to get to writing this testimonial. I have held the most gratitude in my heart to Dr. Phil Whisnand since he came to our home. I can’t imagine any better of a situation for such a difficult time. If you have a pet that is suffering, this is 100% the way to go. So peaceful and seamless. These people really do wonderful work. Thank you a million times over and I will be using these folks in the future as our four legged friends just don’t stick around as long as we would love them to.

> I made the difficult decision to end my fur baby’s suffering after she was diagnosed with kidney failure on Tuesday. Alexa rapidly declined from my energetic, bubbly baby to a lethargic shell of herself. She had lost weight and stopped eating and drinking. She seemed to look into my eyes asking for help! She sensed something was wrong. I called Dr. Darden on Saturday and scheduled an appointment on Sunday. She patiently answered all my questions and explained the process. She compassionately interacted with my pet to put us all at ease. Alexa even wagged her tail at her as if she sensed she was a friend. After allowing me and my family time to spend loving on Alexa for the last time, she assisted my pet to a painfree and peaceful passage over the rainbow bridge. Though my heart is broken to end the12 years spent with my baby, I cannot say enough positive things to express my gratitude to Dr. Darden making this process more bearable. Thank you again.

> Having Dr Rachel here to help my little (fur) brother Buddy be comfortable and at peace in his final time was very comforting to me and my family. We choose to have the Dr come here so Buddy was in a familiar place with his loved ones. I didn’t want my little brother to be in a hospital or with strangers when it was time, he meant more to me than that, he meant more to me and my family than I can even convey, we got him at a time of tragedy and he brought us almost 11yrs of peace and love and happiness, the joy Buddy brought my family was beyond words. I thank you Dr Rachel for helping keep Buddy comfortable, your communication was fantastic, and we thank you again from the bottom of our hearts.

> We want to express our gratitude to Pet Loss at Home and to Dr. Michael Leverone for being there for us when the time came for us to say goodbye to our beloved Malamute, Seneca. He was exactly the type of person we needed on Oct. 20, as he was very caring, compassionate and sympathetic to our feelings. After giving her the best life we could for almost 12 years, we were able to give her a stress free, painless release to the rainbow bridge. Although we are heartbroken at our loss, she is no longer in pain and that is our comfort. Bob& Joan from New Hampshire

> Unfortunately, I have seen Dr. Tamara Smith too many times in the last several years, and I truly thank God that she has the compassion to do what she does. When I have needed her, she is there for me and my pet. She is kind, compassionate, tender hearted and sadly its never been a 9-5 timing in my pet losses. What a gift she provides. She provides us the peace we search for when we lose a family member. She sat outside on the porch at sunrise to help me save goodbye to Simon my cat, she set on the couch with me when it was time to say goodbye to my cat Thomas and tonight she sat on the floor to help me say goodbye to my big ole’ Jesse Girl. Thank you so much Dr. Smith and to the service of Pet Loss at Home.

> I cannot say enough about Dr. Clayton. We had to make the worst decision of our lives the weekend of Thanksgiving and we were so blessed to have Dr. Clayton come to our home. He was the most caring ,most kind doctor you can imagine. I hope that no one ever has to face this time in their life but if you do these people are truly angels. They went above and beyond to help us and they came very promptly and with such compassion and caring we could never asked for more.  
>  The care and respect they showed my Dozer is truely something that will help me get through is awful time.  
>  God Bless Dr. Clayton and this organization!
