# In Memory of “Bella”

“Bella”

In memory of Bella – In a short 10 years, Bella was not only deeply loved by her family, but she touched the lives of everyone who met her. She was happiest when she could help around the house and brought so much joy to our lives. She loved camping trips, chasing bunnies and squirrels, and stealing tomatoes from our garden. Rest in Peace our dear Bella Bean.
