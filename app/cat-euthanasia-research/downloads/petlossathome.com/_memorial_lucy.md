# In Memory of Lucy

Lucy

I had to say good bye to my sweet sweet Lucy today. She was my special  
baby girl who was so feisty but full of love. She loved taking walks,  
laying in the sun and taking naps with her mom. She was at home in my  
arms when she passed, her favorite place to be. She will be greatly  
missed by Ruby and Henry but most of all by me, her mom.
