# In Memory of “Stevie”

“Stevie”

“After a very short 11 years, I had to say the hardest goodbye to my best friend. Stevie came into my life when I was going through some tough times and she became my light. She was by my side through so many changes in my life and before marriage and kids. She was the best big sister to Teeny, Quintin and Cash. She touched so many hearts with her loving personality and lots of doggie kisses. My heart is broken but I’m thankful you aren’t in pain anymore and went peacefully at home with those you loved around you. You were an amazing dog and I’ll never forget you. Rest in peace my beautiful baby girl, I’ll miss you always”
