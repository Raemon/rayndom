# In Memory of Ophelia

Ophelia

“So very grateful to Dr. O’Leary for helping us end the suffering of our darling Ophelia with such compassion and warmth. Our lovely girl was being taken by cancer at far too young of age. It came on so quickly and so relentlessly. It was absolutely horrible. Dr. O’Leary came in to our home with the sweetest, gentlest touch and brought peace to us all at such a difficult time. We are eternally grateful. We will miss little Ophelia forever.”
