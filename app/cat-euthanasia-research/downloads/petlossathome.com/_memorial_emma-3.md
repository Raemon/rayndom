# In Memory of Emma

Emma

Emma was more than a best friend or pet, she was a bright spot in our lives and we will miss her beautiful face every day. Although he passing was absolutely heartbreaking, we were comforted by Dr. Allegra and her thoughtful and caring approach to this procedure. Dr. Allegra came to our home after a last minute request, after hours, on a Friday evening. She did not need to do this, but she could tell we were in need of help, and Emma was ready. We cannot thank Pet Loss at Home and Dr. Allegra for a sad, but amazingly heartwarming experience. Thank you.
