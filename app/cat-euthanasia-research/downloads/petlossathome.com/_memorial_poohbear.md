# In Memory of Poohbear

Poohbear

My Beautiful Poohbear. She was my loyal protector and companion for 15 years. Her big furry body was ready to go. When she was younger she would jump on my bed when I got home waiting for her welcome home hug. Up on her hind legs with her front paws on my shoulder and her head to my chest. She has not been able to do that for many years now. She followed me everywhere before her arthritis took over. I am sad to let her go but will cherish her time in my life. Dr. Phil was so sweet and Pooh was peaceful in her final time with her mommy.  
Thank you for your service. I made a difficult time so much more peaceful.  
Suzanne
