# In Memory of Sophie Ann

Sophie Ann

Madison, WI: Sophie Ann, my beautiful baby died yesterday. Born 2006 – Died February 17, 2015. She had the sweetest disposition and was the most loving little creature. Animals add so much joy to your life and I will miss her so very much. Thank you to PetLossAtHome.com. Dr. Karen made this experience one of peace and love and I would never ever ever take an animal I love out of the home environment if/when this becomes necessary again. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
