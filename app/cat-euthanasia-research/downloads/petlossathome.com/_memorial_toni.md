# In Memory of “Toni”

“Toni”

We were fortunate to have Toni with us for almost 19 years. She was a wonderful friend to the family and our other animals. Toni was brought into our home with our wonderful golden retriever, Buddy. When he passed, she welcomed in Molly, our yorkie-poo and more recently 2 other kitties; Frankie and Toni.
