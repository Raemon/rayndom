# In Memory of Buck

Buck

“Buck wasn’t a hunter, he wasn’t the best behaved and he didn’t listen  
very well. But he did love his family as much or more than any dog ever  
has and you know what? That was more than enough. We were very fortunate  
to have that big goofy guy in our lives.

Buck was a sweet, sensitive soul and didn’t have an aggressive bone in  
his body. In all the time he was with us I never even heard him growl.  
He just wanted to give and get love. And that’s exactly what happened  
for 13 years. We love you and miss you and you will always be in our  
hearts. Rest in peace Buck”
