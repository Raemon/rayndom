# In Memory of “Kovu”

“Kovu”

“Kovu was a dog lots thought was scary but deep down he was the biggest baby you could imagine – he loved to sun bathe on nice days and even the cold he would love to just sit outside. He was such an important member of our family and we already miss him and his tall ears and snoring like crazy! Thank you for the wonderful memories sweet baby.”
