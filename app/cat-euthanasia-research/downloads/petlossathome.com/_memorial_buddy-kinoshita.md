# In Memory of “Buddy” Kinoshita

“Buddy” Kinoshita

“Buddy, part of our family for 17 years, died peacefully at the age of 18 on my lap, exactly as he sat on my lap when I first met him as a 1 year old at the SPCA. He lived a wonderful life as a big happy fat orange cat, and he is sorely missed, but I feel good knowing that we were a part of each others lives. Keep zooming around being silly, keep chasing those invisible creatures at the bottoms of grocery bags, and blobbing like only you can, wherever you are.”
