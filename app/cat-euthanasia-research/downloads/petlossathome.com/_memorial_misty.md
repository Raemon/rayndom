# In Memory of Misty

Misty

This is Misty, my precious blue 80 lb. Weimaraner that lived to the ripe old age of 15.75 human years. How old she must have been in dog years! She passed on 10/17/18, but will forever be in our hearts. She was the sweetest, most loyal dog anyone could ask for. She always had one eye open. Even in the deepest sleep, if we walked by, an eye peeped open to keep watch over us. Thanks to Dr. Christina Kinkade of Pet Loss at Home for making the process of sending Misty to her final rest just a little bit easier. RIP Misty Blue…
