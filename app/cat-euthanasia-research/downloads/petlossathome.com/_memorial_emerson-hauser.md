# In Memory of Emerson Hauser

Emerson Hauser

We said good-bye to Emerson on Friday evening. His beagle spirit was sent back into the universe, including the energy that wagged his white-tipped tail for 12 years. Unfortunately, his body wore out before his spirit. He was truly one of a kind and will be missed by everyone who whose lives he touched.
