# In Memory of Sugar

Sugar

To my loving baby Sugar,

(White German Shepard)

Sugar was diagnosed with Bone cancer. Even with her illness she has such a wonderful, happy and loving spirit. I wanted to have her put down in the comfort of our home. The process was very peaceful and stress free for my baby. Thank you for your kind gentle hands when taking care of my princess. She will be missed dearly.
