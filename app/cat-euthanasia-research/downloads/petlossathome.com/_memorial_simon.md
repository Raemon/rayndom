# In Memory of Simon

Simon

“Simon” Our silly, sweet boy.  
You were the king in our house. You welcomed any animal or person that came to our home. Your daily stomp-like run to the door to greet us is sorely missed. And more than anything I miss your hugs. You came to us as a crumpled, broken kitten and grew into a stunning, strong, loving, humorous soul. You made us laugh with your twittering noises and goofy mischief. You brought us so much joy with your love and your stretches on our legs to be picked up for hugs. 15 years does not feel like enough time with you. You will always be in our hearts.
