> Dr Allegra Liu has helped us say tearful goodbyes to two of our beloved pets. One was a 16 year old Golden Retriever who just wore out. The other was a mutt who was 17 and appeared to have dementia and anxiety. My vet was on vacation so I was not able to discuss what was going on with him yet Dr. Allegra Liu called me back and spent 20 minutes on the phone with me sharing her knowledge. She also fit me in on a day I had scheduled for her to come yet had cancelled. She is so compassionate and such a soft voice and touch with the animals.Since these animals had given us joy for so many years I did not want to stress them out with a trip to the vet and have chosen to have them put down in our home. She is the best and I would highly recommend her and these services.

> Anyone that loves animals knows that one of the hardest things you ever have to do is to end your pet’s suffering. I just had to do that for my cat Bandit who I only had for 10 years. I adopted him and his brother Smokey when they were kittens from a rescue site and Smokey got cancer last year and I had to end his suffering in August 2017. Now, not even a year later Bandit got sick with some “idiopathic” illness that was causing his lungs to fill up with fluid. 4 different vets could not figure out how to fix it so after several procedures of draining his lungs I decided to end his suffering. Being a single person and living alone, it was one of the hardest things to decide because he was my buddy and always knew when I needed comforting but I know he is not suffering anymore and is at peace now. Dr. Liu was excellent. She came to the house and was very compassionate and calm and let me spend as much time as I needed with Bandit before she took him. We all know that we will probably outlive our pets and when they pass it is always heart breaking but I also can’t imagine life without them. I look forward to seeing all my pets someday at the Rainbow Bridge!

> Good morning. Thank you so much, I am so glad we made the right decision it is still hard and will be for some time, when you open the door we expect him to be there to greet us, but time will heal, you were so sweet and understanding and it made it so much easier. Sharon

> Dr. Liu was so kind and compassionate. It was so comforting to know we could say goodbye to our darling kitty in the privacy of own home. And such prompt, comprehensive and kind services. Thank you for what you do! – Michelle

> Dr. Liu came to our rescue when we realized that our large 14 year old shepherd mix , Buck, was just too anxious a dog to be put to sleep away from home at the vet.. We had made the careful plans with our vet (who we have known and loved for over a decade) and knew the time had come for our dear dog to be put to sleep. It was so stressful because when the dayvcame, he was just too anxious and uncomfortable to put in the car. Pet Loss cane through right away with Dr. Liu. She came out to our home later that day. She was gentle and patient and skillful. Buck was at ease and comfortable, and did not feel afraid or suffer at all. We are so grateful!

> Dr. Allegra Liu was calm, gentle, compassionate and excellent with this very difficult experience. She gave us the time we needed in saying goodbye and was a comforting presence. She also communicated in scheduling by text with quick responses which I found very helpful.

> Dr. Christina Kinkade just helped me through one of the most difficult days of my life, putting down my best friend of 14 years, Booker. Except that the name is already taken, I think the business should be renamed to be “Visiting Angels”.
> 
> Last Thursday Dr. Christina visited our home and with much kindness helped put our 14 year old Morgan to rest suffering from cancer. Morgan always cried and whimpered on the way to the vet and when I located this service and spoke with Dr. Christina I knew it was right for Morgan. She went quietly, quickly and peacefully in her usual seat on the couch. We could not be more grateful. Thank you Dr. Christina and to all who provide this service.

> We are writing you to express our sincere gratitude for the caring work that Dr. Phil Whisnand performed for us in laying our 15 yr old dog Chance to sleep on Monday. Dr. Whisnand’s gentle nature and patience where perfect for us as we struggled through saying goodbye to our sweet boy. Rest assured that he is represemting your firm with the utmost professionalism and integrity. We would highly recommend him to others who wish to say their final goodbyes in the comfort of their dog’s home.

> Dr. Greg, I want to thank you again for helping us through this terrible time. Words can’t express how much we appreciate your compassion and patience with us. I know you provide a much needed service but you go that extra mile to make it as comfortable as possible. Your a good person and the world is better for it.

> So glad that we used your service. Our dog was suffering with pain, especially in his shoulder. He couldn’t stand to be touched without crying. I knew he needed to be put down, but I didn’t want to hurt him taking him to the vet, and I didn’t want him frightened. Dr. Darden came to our home and we sat on our lawn with our dog’s head in lap and we got to talk to him, kiss him, etc. until he was gone. It was a serene setting and our guy just went to sleep. Thank you so much for having this service!

> My sister and her family are truly grateful to Dr. Alicia Darden for her kindness and professionalism. She came out on a Sunday afternoon to ease my sister’s dog out of his pain. Because poor Champ was in too much pain for us to try to move him, she performed all of her tasks in the pouring rain, in the driveway where he had collapsed that morning. Dr. Darden went above and beyond to be helpful in every way, even producing a stretcher to carry my sister’s dog to his grave near their fish pond, and helping to carry the stretcher, loaded with Champ’s 70-pound body, up concrete steps through the mud. No one in my family has ever used this sort of service before; when the time has come to euthanize a pet, we have always made a sad, and for the pet, frightening, trip to a vet’s office. My sister and I have both decided that based on our experience with Dr. Darden, we will not hesitate to recommend her, and this service, to other pet lovers who are faced with this difficult situation.

> Thanks to Dr. Alicia Darden for the nice card and Holly’s paw print and some of her hair. We will cherish this forever. Thanks for coming so quick and being so encouraging to me, and crying with me. I will never forget you. God Bless you for your love for animals and care for their owners.

> My husband and I are extremely grateful to Dr. Alicia Darden for her generosity and compassion. Since our dog, Nubbins was in too much pain for us to try to move him, we felt the right thing to do was to euthanize him at his home. Since his inability to walk by himself was so sudden, we had very little time to find somebody to help us manage this situation. We called several other services prior to getting in touch with Dr. Darden. Once we talked to her, she drove an hour and a half late on a Tuesday night to put our precious dog out of his pain. Dr. Darden went above and beyond to be helpful in every way and based on our experience with Dr. Darden, we will absolutely recommend her to anybody that has the difficult decision to make to say goodbye to a dearly loved pet. Thank you so much.

> What was a very emotionally painful decision resulted in a peaceful, tranquil ,spiritual ,farewell for my pet and myself. Dr. Moore was caring,gentle,patient,soft spoken and skillful. My pet passed at home surrounded by those who loved him and without fear or stress. This is how I had hoped it would be. We are both at peace.

> I enthusiastically recommend Dr. Moore to provide the best care for one’s pet when it is time to say good bye to one’s beloved pet at home. It was worth every cent.

> We just met Dr. Sarah Hadzic and she was incredible with our dog Bear. Bear was a rescue dog that we adopted in 2005 and has been an important part of our family ever since. EVERYONE LOVED Bear even other pets! We were heartbroken when we found out he had a malignant mass in his sinus. We just received the results and began treatment on Thursday. Saturday early morning he took a quick but drastic turn for the worse. We knew he wasn’t feeling well and were going to the vet on Monday. Sunday morning we saw him decline rapidly and that is when we contacted Dr. Hadzic. She got here very quickly and was able to end Bear’s suffering. We really do appreciate your service.

> I wanted to thank you for providing your wonderfully humane Pet Euthansia at home service. My dear cat who gave us nothing but joy for over 15 years was struggling with congestive heart failure for the last four months. We knew his time was near but it was a Sunday and we did not want to take him to an emergency veterinary hospital where he would spend his last moments on a stainless steel table. We heard about Pet Loss at Home and called them and they agreed to come out right away. Dr. Sarah Hadzic was wonderful when she came to our home and treated us with great kindness and compassion. Our cat passed away very peacefully in his favorite chair in my husband’s arms. I am so happy we were able to provide him with that relief in his final moments in such a comforting manner. Thank you so much for providing this very important service for us at this very sad time.

> Waylon, our Australian Shepherd, had been given another year to live through treatments for cancer found July 2013. He made great strides in living a healthy life, but the first week of September his health took a turn for the worse. We contacted Dr. Monique Lewison, and her comforting words were helpful as she discussed the decisions we faced. Waylon passed away Friday September 5th at the moment a rain shower blew through the Wheaton area and before Dr. Lewison came. We were grateful for our conversations with Dr. Lewison on that day. We love you “Buddy”! Joan and Jeff

> I am so thankful I stumbled across Pet Loss At Home in my “what do I do now?” searches. My cat Furball has been the one constant over the last 17 years, keeping me amused and grounded as I’ve lived in countless places and cities. I was dreading her last experience with me being a visit to sterile office surrounded with strange smells and noisy animals (worse yet, in a cat carrier she’s always despised). When I finally had the courage to reach out, Dr. Monique Lewison responded to my message right away and was flexible to accommodate my schedule and brave the Chicago construction and traffic to come to us. She was wonderful with Furball, very empathetic and didn’t rush us through any part of the process. I couldn’t have imagined a better result for a decision I’ve been avoiding for many weeks and am enormously grateful to Dr. Monique for making my last memories of Furball as nice as they could be. Thank you- H.W.

> On June 21, 2018 we had our beloved Lily B put to sleep, in the same house she had lived for nearly 16 years. Lily B was a lab/pit rescue – loud, bossy, smart and loved every human she encountered. The mere thought of not having that vivid presence in our lives was crushing. I will be forever grateful for Pet Loss at Home and Dr. Holly Pietschmann. Dr. Holly was remarkably professional. Our phone call to set up the visit allowed me to ask questions. In person her demeanor was knowledgable and compassionate. My husband, a surgeon, could not bear to be present, but my two dog loving best friends were with me. Dr. Holly didn’t hurry the process and let us give Lily B lots of hugs and kisses. She gently asked me if I was ready and then administered a sedative first, so Lily B was sleepy and calm. I laid on the couch next to her and cuddled like we always did. Her death was very peaceful, and again Dr. Holly did not hurry our goodbyes. My friends helped put her nearly fifty pound body on the stretcher and with the blanket tucked up under her chin, Lily B looked like she was simply dreaming. When my husband came home to the empty house I could tell him that it was ok, and that I will always look back on that day as happy/sad and filled with love. Dr. Holly sent me a lovely note afterwards, which I saved, along with all the cards from Lily B’s fans and friends. The mere fact that I am writing this testimonial seven months after her death is affirmation of how poignant the memory is, and how supported I felt.

> When my husband and I finally had to make that ultimate decision yesterday to spare our precious Oreo any more pain, God sent us to your site. Oreo never liked leaving home and traveling to the vet was very traumatic for him. Dr. Dave Sherer was so compassionate and made Oreo’s journey stress free for him. Being able to hold him in a place that he is so familiar and hear our comforting words beside his ear made his journey stress free and comforting for us at the same time. We did not feel rushed at any time and Dr. Sherer explained the process and what to expect throughout his passing. We feel so blessed that we could do this for our Oreo. I can only say that for any individuals having to make this decision; never hesitate to use the in-home transition provided by this group.

> I’m sure you’ve read hundreds of notes just like this, but I must send my heartfelt thanks to Pet Loss At Home, and most especially Dr. Dave Sherer. Last Sunday it was time to say goodbye to my sweet baby, and old “junkyard dog”, Gemma. I called your number and Dr. Dave called me right back. He patiently listened to my story of Gemma’s slow decline and quietly agreed with me that it was time to end her struggles… The quiet humility and peace that she was allowed to leave this world in was so beautiful. Dr. Dave was wonderful, explaining every step, and letting us go through the process at our own pace. Gemma passed with so much love, many kisses, and all the sweetness we could offer her… It was a huge blessing not to have to move her to the car, and then a sterile table where she would have been extremely stressed. I am forever grateful to Pet Loss At Home and Dr. Dave Sherer for providing such a peaceful alternative. And while I write this with fresh tears, and will miss my puppy always, I know that we gave her a beautiful transition. I will see her again, with all of our other loyal companions, at the Rainbow Bridge… Namaste’ my sweet Gem

> Thank you for helping us with our Otis, our Beagle, this past Sunday. He was with us a long time, coming into our home from a shelter 11 years ago at about 4 years of age. He joined new brothers Remus and Voldie. He wanted our love and attention and quickly adapted into our home. We think he had good times with us, he was a good boy, friendly to all, playful, even when he was sick. We only found out about his cancer about month ago, it was throughout his body. Our vet treated him to make him comfortable, but the disease finally became too much for him. We knew we would have to make a decision that was best for him. Sunday we realized he couldn’t take anymore. Pet Loss At Home and Dr. Barb came to our rescue. Barb talked to us and to Otis, she petted him and let our family all sit around him holding him on the floor while she gave him an injection to relax him. Barb explained and instructed us on what would happen and what we needed to do. Otis didn’t even feel the end, he just passed peacefully with his chin on my knee while he slept. At last he looked relaxed, his expression no longer held pain, it was our old, happy Otis. We hope he is remembering all his happy moments with us and his brothers.. Thank you, Dr. Barb and Pet Loss At Home , for being there for us.

> “Dr. Karner came to our home on short notice to help us send our beautiful 15 year old boy Buddy to the rainbow bridge. Her compassion for our situation was wonderful. With such a hard decision to make, we were so glad that someone like Dr. Karner was here with us. The mementos she left us with in giving us his lock of fur and his beautiful paw print will always be cherished! The card she send a few days later touched our hearts. Thank you so much Dr.Karner for your compassion during the toughest decision we had to make. I will recommend to anyone who has to make this dreadful decision.

> I can not thank you enough for the valuable service you provide. Dr. Karner came to my home to do a deed that I was dreading, yet knew was inevitable. She was there within an hour. She euthanized my 17 year old chihuahua in my dog’s own home surrounded by all her favorite sounds and smells. I have recommended your services to several people that are facing the same situation. Dr. Karner deserves a raise! This has to be a terrible job and she was wonderful!
