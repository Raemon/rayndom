# In Memory of “Maxwell” Pentecost

“Maxwell” Pentecost

My warrior and very best friend Maxwell passed away earlier this week. He was my Jack Russell terrier. He lived 17 1/4 years and beat the odds so many times. No fear anywhere in his body, yet the most loving animal to ever live. Smarter than any animal I have ever known. He gave me his life, his loyalty, his trust and most of all his unconditional love. He went peacefully to sleep at the vet’s office about 5 o’clock this afternoon. He was my hero and always will be. I love him dearly.
