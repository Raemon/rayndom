# In Memory of Luna

Luna

“Our wonderful beautiful Luna loved us to pieces as we did her. 10 1/2 years went by way too fast and now our hearts ache missing our girl. She talked to us every day with her amazing woo woo wooing and understood our thoughts. Luna is inseparable from us for eternity. We can’t wait to see you again sweetheart Luna.”
