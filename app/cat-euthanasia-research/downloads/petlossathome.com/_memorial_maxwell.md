# In Memory of Maxwell

Maxwell

We adopted Maxwell from a senior dog rescue two years ago. He was a perfect dog. We will miss his mostly toothless smile, his kisses, lip smacking, full body shakes, intense morning stretches, cuddles, and large appetite. Our house feels empty now that he isn’t excitedly greeting us as we walk in the door. He was so innocently naughty and stubborn, but most importantly, he was a harmless, barkless, ice cream-loving sweetheart. We feel so lucky to have spent the last two years of his life with him.
