# In Memory of “Toby”

“Toby”

“Toby was the best boy a girl in her early 20s could ever ask for. He was there for me through college, roommate’s, an across country move, marriage, and kids. He was there through all of my milestones in life, and was the most supportive soul. Toby went across the rainbow bridge on 09/08/24 and I think I will miss him for the rest of my life. Thank you Dr. Holly for making the saddest moment of my life, a beautiful one.”
