# What I Learned From a Pet Loss Grief Counselor about Love, Death and (Never) Letting Go

The conversation surrounding death and dying is increasingly gaining traction, whether through popular literature or the growing presence of death doulas. However, one significant aspect often overlooked is the profound grief associated with losing a pet. The emotional pain experienced when a beloved animal companion passes can be just as intense as that felt for human losses. Unfortunately, societal customs surrounding mourning often neglect the need for acknowledgment and support during this time.

As pet ownership surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, many individuals found themselves forming deep bonds with their animals. This has prompted a need for guidance on how to navigate the inevitable loss of these cherished companions. Preparing for the loss of a pet, while also honoring their memory, is essential for emotional well-being.

Beth Bigler, a renowned grief counselor specializing in pet loss, emphasizes the importance of recognizing the depth of the bond shared with animals. In her book, “Honoring Our Animals: 365 Meditations for Healing After Pet Loss,” she provides insights into the grieving process. Bigler highlights that pets often represent some of life’s most authentic relationships, offering unconditional love and companionship. The absence of these relationships can leave a lasting void, making the grief associated with their passing both profound and enduring.

Unfortunately, the grief experienced from losing a pet is frequently marginalized. Society often fails to validate this type of loss, leading to feelings of isolation and shame among mourners. Comments such as “it was just a dog” can diminish the significance of this grief, leaving individuals without the support they need. Unlike human losses, which are often recognized with sympathy gestures, pet loss is typically met with silence.

Furthermore, many individuals do not receive adequate emotional education regarding death during their formative years. This lack of understanding can hinder their ability to process loss when it occurs. It is crucial for parents to model emotional honesty when dealing with the death of a pet, as this can provide children with valuable lessons about grief and healing.

Bigler encourages individuals to keep the memory of their pets alive even after they have passed. She suggests various practices that can help maintain the connection, such as writing letters to and from the pet, creating memorial jewelry, or establishing altars to honor their memory. Engaging in familiar routines, like evening walks or preparing meals that were once shared, can also serve as a comforting reminder of the bond that remains.

In reflecting on the lives of beloved pets, individuals may find that their memories evoke more joy than sorrow. The goal of grieving is not to simply move on but to cherish the connection that continues to exist. By allowing oneself to feel the full spectrum of emotions associated with pet loss, healing can begin.

Ultimately, recognizing the significance of pet loss and creating space for grief can lead to a healthier emotional journey. It is vital to honor the love shared with these companions, ensuring that their memory continues to enrich lives long after they have left this world.
