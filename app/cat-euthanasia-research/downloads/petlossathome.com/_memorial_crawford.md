# In Memory of Crawford

Crawford

To our sweet Crawford, thank you for being such a warm and loving companion to us for ten years. We’ll never forget all those long walks we’d take to Tom’s bench in Montara. We will greatly miss our walks to the park and your puppy dog face. Our home is so sad right now but we find peace knowing you are in heaven chasing Augie around.
