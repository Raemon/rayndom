> “Today, Dr. Abby Regner came today to help our almost 15 year old chocolate lab, Aggie, over the rainbow bridge. She was kind, loving, and extremely respectful with both myself and sweet Aggie. I highly recommend doing this at home and for the pup’s sake and highly recommend Dr. Abby Regner.”

> “So very kind, stepped us through a tough process.”

> “Our family is devastated after saying goodbye to Bowser, our 12 year old yellow lab. When I called and spoke with Dr. Holly, she was so kind and agreed to come over within 2 hours. She was the perfect person to come. She made the most awful time for us more bearable. Her compassion, patience, knowledge and heart were exactly what we needed at the worst time we have ever gone through. We knew the day would come and you can never be prepared but having Dr. Holly there taking such great care of our pup (and us) was something we will never forget and can never thank her enough. Having the ability to keep Bowser at home, in his favorite spot, in the sunshine was the best possible goodbye we could have given him. We thank your service for sending her to us. Her heart and soul were the greatest gift to us and we know our precious Bowser went in peace.”

> “Dr. Tamara was caring and compassionate. She allowed us to move at a comfortable pace. She was very respectful to my good boy Pete.”

> “My family and I would really like to thank Dr Christine Scott for her compassionate beautiful for helping us say our final goodbyes to our precious black panther Tub Tub. He was the most amazing cat ever and Dr.Christine treated him as such and so more and we thank you.”

> “Our dog Belle was with us for 8 great years after rescuing her in January 2016 (she really rescued us). When her health suddenly turned for the worse two weeks ago we were so thankful Dr. Cassie answered our call for help and was available on a Sunday afternoon. She was very kind and compassionate, and Belle’s crossing over was peaceful and dignified and couldn’t have gone any better. This past weekend Dr. Cassie personally delivered Belle’s cremains and paw print cast. We are forever grateful for the support Dr. Cassie provided during such a difficult time.”

> “Dr. Donna O’Leary was so understanding, knowledgeable, caring, during such a difficult time. My sweet dog was at my side for 15 years and his loss was so very hard. Dr. O’Leary is wonderful and I would recommend her to anyone who needs to say good-bye to a special pet.”

> “Our precious little Maltichon, Angel bravely battled Diabetes and being blind for 4 years. We were so blessed when she turned 15 1/2 years old recently. Last Friday night she wasn’t quite herself. I stayed up with her all night to watch over her. I stayed awake with her Saturday night as well because she wasn’t eating and drinking regularly. Around 3:30 a.m. on Sunday she started going downhill enough that we started looking online for help. We called Dr. Dawn from the internet, but she couldn’t help and graciously gave us Dr. Lou Huzella’s information. By then it was around 10:30 a.m. It was so hard to reach out again to let go of Angel go but we looked at his website and felt calm, so we texted him. Dr. Lou had no idea how his day would really go because he ended up coming to our house to help say goodbye to Angel a few hours later. When he walked in he immediately greeted our 2 other dogs, and they were totally at ease with him. They were concerned at that point, and it was really good for them to be with us. Having her put to sleep at home was so much easier than driving her to a sterile room somewhere, crying in front of strangers and driving home without her. We were so grateful for the calm he brought into our situation. I have no idea how he can be so dedicated to so many sad moments but I’m so grateful that he is. I know he’s helping families in crisis, but it has to be difficult sometimes. He walked us through everything before and during then gave us a few minutes alone with her to say goodbye afterwards. Our two other dogs seemed to know she was gone. They’ve been a little sad at times but part of the reason we had this done at home was to do it as a family and give them a chance to understand she was really gone and not coming home. Dr. Lou helped us schedule her cremation and choose an urn and keepsakes. He took care of it all with a separate company. Having your pets put to sleep is going to cost about the same at a vet’s office so you should really consider his services. Saying goodbye to part of my heart was easier at home.”

> “We so appreciate Dr. Ong helping our sweet Roxie across the rainbow bridge.
> 
> She was so calm, considerate, and thoughtful during a terrible time.
> 
> Thank you so much.

> “Dr. Christine was very compassionate, empathetic, and caring. I hated having this done to our beautiful dog, but it was either this, or letting our dog suffer. We couldn’t be happier with her service. She is a very kind , and she takes her time with you, nothing was rushed, what so ever. I miss my baby so much! I’m so happy he’s not suffering anymore though. Thank you Dr.Christine, and God bless you for your service.”

> “We recently had to put down our beloved senior dog after a long battle with cancer. Although it was the most heartbreaking experience we have ever gone through as a family we were grateful to have Dr. Ong with us to help ensure a peaceful transition for our pup. She ensured our dog was nice and comfortable and gave us the time and space to say our goodbyes. Thank you Dr. Ong for making a painful experience as smooth and peaceful it could be, we will be forever thankful.”

> “The vet that came to our house was the sweetest woman ever and truly made this icky situation a lot easier. She was so respectful and made us, and our cat, feel as comfortable as possible during this whole process. She talked us through everything she was doing and allowed us space and time to grieve. I’m not sure how she manages to do this job every day, but we are so appreciative and everyone in this company deserves a lot of respect. Thank you so much for not only performing the service, but for doing it with so much love and compassion.”

> “Dr. Christine came when the love of my life my kitty Mickey Bear was ready to go. She was so compassionate and caring. It was very peaceful and loving.  
>  Dr. Christine is wonderful.
> 
> Thank you so very much for taking care of my wonderful Mickey Bear.”

> “We were so blessed to have found Pet Loss at Home and Dr. Christine Scott. During such a difficult time for our family she was so kind and patient and attentive to our whole family to include our other pets in the home. The calmness she brought into our home was exactly what we needed for this process. I would highly encourage anyone who is having to make this difficult decision for their furbaby to really consider doing it in the comfort of their home. Thank you again Dr. Christine you are truly an angel on earth.”

> “My partner and I are grateful for Dr. Bender services. She was able to accommodate us on short notice when no one else could. She did a wonderful job explaining the process before we said goodbye to our boy. With her help, he was able to die peacefully at home in the warmth of the morning sun.”

> “I can’t express enough how incredible Dr. Mary Ann Bender is! We had already had arrangements with a different group but my sweet girl just wasn’t going to make it and they had no other open appointments. I called Dr. Mary Ann and she said in her voicemail to leave a text. She responded almost instantly and was so accommodating! Not only did she make time to come to my home within hours that I first called her but she took her time in explaining everything and chatting a bit while waiting for our daughter to arrive. Her experience and knowledge was superior and outstanding!
> 
> I have had three pet losses over the years, first one in the vet’s office, the last two done at home. Having the opportunity to have your sweet pet cross the rainbow bridge in the privacy of your home is by far the best experience you could give your pet. It is a heartbreaking decision to make and Pet Loss at Home and Dr. Mary Ann Bender was the best choice I made for my girl.
> 
> If you are faced with this unbearable decision rest assure they will help you and make every last minute with your pet count. They explain everything from cost to how the procedure is done and how your pet will react to the meds that are given as well as aftercare. They give you a paw print and lock of hair.”

> “When we concluded that our beloved Luna’s time had come, we knew we couldn’t take her to the vet’s office. Through some karmic Google searching, we found Dr. Lou Huzella in Frederick, MD. From our first contact through helping carry her body to his car, we knew we had found the right person to help us with this difficult, but necessary, task.
> 
> I have always felt it is my sacred duty as a pet owner to make the difficult decision my pet can’t. While I’ve done this before, it was always in a vet’s office. We made a special request of Dr. Lou with respect to time and location, and he didn’t hesitate to accommodate us. Luna made her transition on her terms, and ours.
> 
> No fuss, no struggle for Luna. No stress, anxiety or regret for us.
> 
> It was as joyous and beautiful as something so sad could possibly be.
> 
> There is nothing we would change about our experience.
> 
> Dr. Lou (and others like him) is doing sacred work by bringing his very special and unique gift directly to the pet owner and the pet. His generosity, compassion, and care for both pet and owners are evident.
> 
> If you find yourself struggling with this decision, struggle no more.”

> “On 1/30 I contacted Laps of love regarding my 12 year old black lab JACK – unfortunately they didn’t have any openings until the end of the week and referred me to pets loss at home – I contacted them immediately and left a message for Dr Donna Oleary . She called me back immediately and asked what was going on . I explained Jack was peeing / pooping / throwing up blood on the floor was not walking and fell that morning . She was at my house within an hour and was so compassionate to our family and Jack as well . DR OLEARY came into my house after speaking to me outside explained everything to myself and my family what was going to take place , sat on the floor with Jack and talked to him and pet him – she made his crossing over the rainbow bridge so easy for him and us . She stayed on the floor with him the whole time and kept telling him it was ok . She was so compassionate in our difficult time . Dr Oleary said we should have jacks ashes back on Saturday 2/3 with a possibility of the following Saturday 2 /10. Saturday 2/3 I recieved a text stating Jack will be back home with us between 12-4- I explained I would be out for a few hours and if we could do it closer to 4:00. Dr Oleary brother in law was gracious enough to push off dropping off Jack until about 6:00pm . I can’t say enough nice things about Dr Donna Oleary from the minute I spoke to her that morning until she left she was very nice and comforting . Before she left she kept giving me hugs . A few days after my family recieved a sympathy card from Dr Oleary in the mail . Thank you Dr Oleary for everything on 1/30 .”

> “Dr. Arnold was the answer to my prayers- literally. Having to put down my childhood best friend 4 1/2 months shy of her 21st birthday was one of the most difficult things I have ever had to do. I knew that I wanted someone to come to the house so that Pokey would have a dignified, peaceful passing. Dr. Arnold not only got back to me right away after my initial inquiry, he followed up with me a few times afterward- truly unheard of in the veterinary industry. This experience broke my heart but it was also very beautiful and perfect. Thank you Dr. Arnold, I am forever in your debt.”

> “Our sweet baby girl, Gladys, was diagnosed with bladder cancer. It escalated so quickly we had so little time to setup the appointment that no one ever wants to have to schedule. We had to call around to find someone that could do it same day. Dr Teague reached out immediately and was available later that day. He was very professional and personable. He let us take our time saying goodbye and explained the process start to finish. Saying goodbye was the hard part. Dr Teague made everything else so easy. I highly recommend Pet Loss at Home for at-home euthanasia. And honestly, this experience made me realize I will never do it at a vets office. Our baby was happy and comfy for all of it and was not scared like she would have been at a vets office. She fell asleep at peace and passed peacefully.”
> 
> Thank you Dr Teague!

> “The hardest part of having pets is when the time has come to let them go. It’s a huge responsibility, but one I have always taken seriously with my many pets through the years. However, losing my sweet Angel was the hardest decision I’ve ever had to make. She was my “heart” dog, my “soul” dog. I’ve always taken my pets to the vet when the time has come for them, but I just couldn’t do that with Angel. I didn’t want her last memory to be of walking into a vet’s office, so I was happy to find out about Pet Loss at Home through my vet’s office, and arrangements were made for Dr. Carol Ong to come to my house. When I called her that it was “time”, she was able to come to my house later that same morning. She took care of arranging transport as well.
> 
> She was prompt, and very respectful of the whole situation. She treated Angel with gentleness and kindness, and helped her with that final “sleep’. I was so glad I could do that one last indulgence for the dog who had been such an important part of my life for 10 years. She was a Diva, a Princess, and she deserved to be at home, in her safe place, and with the people she loved at her side.
> 
> Dr. Ong has a tough job, but she handled it with kindness and dignity. I appreciate that.”

> “Absolutely blown away by our experience! Dr. Tammy was AMAZING.. She was phenomenal with our tiny Yorkie and reassured us we were making the right decision. So glad we did this at home. My 14 year old daughter stayed through the process and Dr Tammy explained everything in detail. Outstanding! Don’t hesitate to use them if you find your pet needing their services.”

> “We unfortunately had to put our furbaby Sugar down . Dr.Darden was so sweet and understanding and made it possible for us to do this in Sugars home where she could be comfortable and surrounded by family. Thank Dr Darden for such a quick response to our call.”

> “I cannot thank Dr. Coon enough for the compassion she showed our family today. This was literally the hardest call I’ve ever made and it took a couple weeks of me calling and hanging up before I was able to find the courage to make the call. Our poor Bella suffered way longer than she should’ve because I just couldn’t do it and Dr. Coon was amazing and compassionate every step of the way! She immediately put all the guilt i was feeling aside and she was knowledgeable and comforting every step of the way. This is never going to be an easy decision but she made me feel like my feelings were important and my daughter had a chance to love and say goodbye on her own terms. I can’t thank Dr. Coon enough for the compassion she showed our family today! This is a service that you hope you never need but know you’re in great hands when you do.”
