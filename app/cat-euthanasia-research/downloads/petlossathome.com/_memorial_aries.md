# In Memory of “Aries”

“Aries”

Aries you were the definition of the “bestest dog ever”!  
I lost so much of my heart on June 13, 2021 when the time came to let you go, you were such a big part of our big family, if love could heal you would have lived forever. I know your spirt is with us and probably saying it with your chest every time someone doesn’t listen to leave your monkey alone. My comfort is in knowing you aren’t in pain but resting in peace.  
We all love & miss you pretty girl!
