# Senior shelter pets are worthy pets

Senior pets are often left in shelters longer than the more youthful playmates, no matter the size, breed or species, according to [PetLossatHome.com](http://www.petlossathome.com) co-founder, Rob Twyning. “This leaves many likely to be euthanized without a family or a home. These animals are scared and alone when their time comes.”

#### **They are not on their way out**

An older pet is still a pet. Every animal deserves a loving, safe place to live, and senior pets are not always what people think.

With senior animals, what you see is what you get. These pets are already established in their personalities. They know who they are, what they like, what they don’t like. This takes the guesswork out of finding your new best friend. If the puppy is playing at your shoe laces, chances are he or she won’t always be the same playful furball as they grow up. If the older dog is tugging at the string on your sweater, chances are, he still has a lot of life left in him, despite his older age. 

#### **They are still trainable**

Often, the senior pets are thought to be ‘untrainable,’ says Twyning. “But this is not the case. Every animal is willing to learn, especially if you pull out their favorite treats. Blueberries, carrots, even the favorite fetch toy.” Finding the right incentive is all it takes to train. Just like with the puppies. 

#### **No. Potty. Training.**

Most senior animals at animal shelters were surrendered by their previous owner. This means, someone else did all the hard work for you. No worrying about potty training. As your senior friend gets older, there is always the chance their ability to run to the door when it is time to go out will fade, as we covered in a previous article.

#### **What of the health issues?**

Adopting a senior buddy creates an instant best friend for both parties involved. There is no love like a pet’s love. Senior pets usually have had families before, so they miss what they used to know. Adopting an older animal is a great way to create an instant bond, and a life-long love. 

Senior pets don’t always have all the health issues one may think. When adopting an older dog or cat, heath issues are always addressed at the clinic or shelter. The animal has already matured, and health issues have, or should have, already been present. 

When it is time to say goodbye to your elderly pet, they don’t have to go back to a scary, sterile space, or a little kennel with others nearby. They can say goodbye to their superhero at home. With the love and compassion they were missing before.
