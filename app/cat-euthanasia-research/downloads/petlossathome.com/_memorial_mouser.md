# In Memory of Mouser

Mouser

Mouser picked me out at the animal shelter, not the other way around. As I walked past his cage, he reached out and just snagged my pants with a claw as if to say “Hey, get back here! You’re supposed to be paying attention to ME!” I couldn’t resist his handsome little face. And for 18 years he never hesitated to remind me that he ought to be my #1 priority. He could be quite the pest but such a sweet, cuddly little pest! I miss him so very much.
