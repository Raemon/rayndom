# In Memory of Tiger

Tiger

17 years… That’s how long I’ve loved you. You were my baby, my first love, and my best friend. You came into my life at a time when I really needed to grow up… and to believe in something… and you gave that to me. I had to “be an adult” for you. I had to “make sure you were taken care of” no matter what was going on in my life. You changed me for the better, and as much as I called you so many names for all the crap you pulled, you were the best thing that ever happened to me. My heart hurts right now, and my heart aches because of the choice I had to make, but you had an amazing life, and I can’t wait to see you “on the other side”… Until then, you can eat all the mice, and lick all the plastic bags you find until I can love you again.
