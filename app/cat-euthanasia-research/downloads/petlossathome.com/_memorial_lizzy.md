# In Memory of “Lizzy”

“Lizzy”

My Sweet Angel Baby❤

“Lizzy”  
2007-2020 

The moment that you left me, my heart split in two.

One side filled with memories, the other side died with you.

I often lie awake at night when the world is fast asleep,

and take a walk down memory lane with tears upon my cheek.

Remembering you is easy, I do it everyday;

but missing you is a heartache that never goes away.

I hold you tightly within my heart and there you will remain.

You see life has gone on without you, but will never

be the same.❤

I love you my sweet pea!

xoxo – mommy
