> Our wonderful labrador retriever, Beau, was 11 1/2 when he was diagnosed with blood clots at the specialty vets in June, 2014. He refused to eat. We called Pet Loss at Home and spoke with Dr. Dale Paley. She was very compassionate, came quickly and Beau was able to die at home, peacefully. He was a wonderful dog, and certainly deserved to be at home, with those he loved and who loved him. I highly recommend this service. Your best friend deserves no less.

> A special Thank You to Dr. Paley for her kindness and compassion in the process of making the hardest decision to put our girls to sleep. If there can possible be a good way to spend your last hours with your dogs, this was definitely the right way. Our Shepherds were siblings so they came into the world together and left the same way just shy of 13 yrs. Our family was able to all be there together and we held them and loved them until the last heartbeat. I wouldn’t have done wanted it any other way!!

> I just wanted to thank you for your compassion and understanding yesterday. Even though it was the hardest thing I have ever done, you helped make the transition easier. It is so nice to know there is someone like you who understands what an pet owner is going through. I can’t thank you enough. I cried most of Sunday and started out Monday pretty good, till I looked out in my back yard and my dog was not there. I miss him dearly but I know it was the right thing to do. Thanks again for your compassion towards me and him.

> On March 12 my daughter had to make the hard decision to euthanize her elderly cat. The cat was immobile and in pain. We wanted to end our cat’s suffering so we found Dr. Foy’s mobile veterinary service. Although he had a very busy schedule he made the time to fit us in. He was pleasant, polite, and professional. He answered all our questions and explained the procedure. Despite his other appointments he gave us his undivided attention and the time we needed. He was instrumental in helping us start our mourning and healing. Dr.Foy is a compassionate and skilled vet, with a wonderful bedside manner. We highly recommend his services.

> Good evening, Dr. Foy,

> I just wanted to send you my sincerest thank you for coming out to provided euthanasia services on Miles this morning. It was very early and short notice, I know. But I can’t tell you how thankful we are that you helped us carry out the plan we wanted for Miles at this time. Miles was a wonderful dog. Beautiful, smart, sweet, gentle. Loved to be outdoors watching the birds and sniffing the air (which is why we were outside). I know we did the best thing for him, but it is still so hard to believe at this point. Allison Zegadlo

> Doctor Foy,

> This is Imelda Samaniego whose feline son Rudy was assisted across the rainbow bridge by you last Friday evening May 13, 2016 around six thirty pm. When euthanasia service had concluded you requested that I notify you when Rudy’s ashes were delivered. I did receive my geriatric sweetheart’s remains this afternoon. The lovely wood box with brass name plate tucked inside a beautiful green velvet bag was perfect for keeping Rudy’s ashes. Thank you very much in aiding my baby boy out of his mortal coil so he could grow irridesnt wings and fly upwards into that great white light. You gave Rudy a perfect extension of mercy on his last night with me in the comfort of home. I truly appreciate your compassionate service.

> Hi Dr. Foy,
> 
> I received your kind card in the mail today. Thank you so much for helping me to ease Emma’s passing. It meant a lot to me to be able to have her die at home, and with as little suffering as possible. She gave me a very happy eight years, and made everyone she met smile.

> Thank you for such great work last night with Lily. I don’t think that could possibly have gone any smoother or more peacefully. I greatly appreciate your kind manner and care through such a tough situation.

> We really appreciated you coming on Friday and taking care of our LEO. I could tell instantly (when I met you) that you are such a kind and caring person. I imagine its so hard at times with what you do. But you do bring peace to those who need your help. Leo didn’t have to suffer at all. It startled us when we finally heard him make the noises he was making that evening. What a blessing that you were coming to Alexandria that night anyways.

> Thank you for reaching out! We have been singing your praises to everyone. You did such a nice job with Molly and we really appreciate your services. We miss Molly terribly but also realize that her time had come. Her passing was handled gently with love and care, in her own bed surrounded by people who loved her. We could not have asked for more.

> Our beloved Willow Jane Beeman left us on 5/22/16. After 13 years of being our Pretty Girl and also our Thud Muffin (she tended to hit the floor loudly when she landed), much beloved and adoring of us in return, we like to think of her journeying to a place beyond that is as peaceful and loving as the home she left behind. We miss her every day and in every way – she’ll be in our hearts always.
> 
> We’d like to thank PetLossAtHome.com for providing us with such a wonderful, caring, and comforting vet, Dr. Tamara Smith. She came quickly to our home and made the process so much better than it would have otherwise been in a clinic where Willow would have been anxious and scared.

> I would like to thank Dr. Tamara Smith for everything she did for me and my dog Teshub late Thursday evening. I think she was a bit surprised by how many people were here to give my 14 year old boy a fond farewell. She was very sweet, professional, and respectful of the situation. In my opinion, she went above and beyond the duties of a regular vet. Teshub’s favorite toy was a frisbee. She took the time to feed him treats out of a frisbee, and encouraged all of us to pet him and love on him until he quietly fell asleep. She made an amazing clay paw print memorial for me to keep, and even gave me a long, heartfelt hug when it was all over. I highly recommend her, and am eternally thankful for her service.

> I wanted to say thank you for your website. When I was stressed and worried, your website was so helpful. I left an email message and was contacted within an hour by Dr. Tamara Smith. Still not 100% convinced I needed her services, I put her off.
> 
> The next day I read the articles on your website and really already knew what had to be done.
> 
> Long story short, Dr. Smith is one of the most compassionate women I’ve ever met. She was friendly, professional, kind and patient. She didn’t rush anything and gave me a hug like she was my family member.  
>  Thank you for making this horrible day, a day I could make it through.
> 
> I want sure where to turn and my very was closed. Stumbling across your site really helped me.

> Dr. Greg, I want to thank you again for helping us through this terrible time. Words can’t express how much we appreciate your compassion and patience with us. I know you provide a much needed service but you go that extra mile to make it as comfortable as possible. Your a good person and the world is better for it.

> No words can explain the loss we feel without you around. You were a huge part of our daily lives. You wake us up in the morning especially if we sleep in. You greet us happily each and every time no matter how we look, smell or feel. You know when we’re sad and you lick away our tears. You’ve seen the bad times and you were a part of all the good times. You will always be our 80-pound lap dog and king of the couch cuddles! Our hearts are broken and what keeps us going is the thought that you are no longer in pain. WE LOVE YOUR FOREVER, MOMO! We will never forget you. Thank you for coming into our lives.

> We said goodbye to our best buddy Merphi last week. We are very grateful Merphi was a part of our family for 15 years, he brought us so much joy and support through many life phases. We are thankful to Dr. Liu to allow us to say goodbye to Merphi in the comfort of our home. Her calm compassionate nature helped us through this sad time and Merphi went peacefully. We love you Merphi.

> This morning we came to the realization that our boy was in distress and needed assistance quickly. I found Pet Loss At Home and within two hours Dr. Liu was at our home. She is the most caring and compassionate person I could’ve wanted to help us. Dr. Liu explained everything she would be doing and was wonderful with our children going out of her way to get them fur clippings and a clay paw print. When you go through something like this, it makes all the difference in the world to have someone there who has a heart. Thank you so much Dr. Liu.

> We are so thankful to have had Dr. Liu’s help in saying goodbye to our beloved little dog. With her very kind, very calm and patient, and very competent assistance, his passing was incredibly gentle and peaceful. It was the absolute best we could have hoped for in such difficult circumstances and for that we are so grateful.
