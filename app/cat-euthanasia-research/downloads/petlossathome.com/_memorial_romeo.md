# In Memory of Romeo

Romeo

After a short and illustrious racing career, at the tender age of three, Romeo chose to share his retirement with me. I was the lucky one to spend nine years with this beautiful, sweet soul. We shared a wonderful life together full of fun vacations and adventures. He was my constant companion, my confidant and my rock. 

Sadly at the age of 12 1/2, Romeo developed bone cancer which progressed rather quickly. The last best gift I gave Romeo was the hardest gift ever. I let him go before his pain got any worse. Seeing him struggle to move around in pain broke my heart. In-home euthanasia was the best way to say goodbye to my beloved Romeo, and Dr. Holly was so compassionate, caring and respectful of my sweet boy that it made it easier to say goodbye. I miss my Romeo but am grateful that he is at peace and was able to go in his home surrounded by family and love. Until we meet at the Rainbow Bridge, I will keep him alive in my heart and through all the wonderful memories we created together.
