# In Memory of “Red”

“Red”

June 13, 2022

Hi Dr. Danton,

Thank you for your patience in waiting for us to complete our payment. We miss our sweet boy, Red, every day but when you said he has crossed the rainbow bridge, we knew his difficult struggle was over. Thank you for what you do being there for families when we have to say good-bye.

Sincerely, Mary Ann and Steve
