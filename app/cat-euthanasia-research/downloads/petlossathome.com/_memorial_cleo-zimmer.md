# In Memory of Cleo Zimmer

Cleo Zimmer

Cleo was a furry human for us – she took care of us all. She sang happy birthday, barked “I Love you”, protected the kids at night by watching over their rooms and during storms, even when she was scared she would look to make sure our daughter wasn’t alone and would go to her first. Cleo smiled, loved to swim, run, play fetch, and loved to be loved…so we gave her all the love we could muster. She will be missed – forever. I will look for Cleo in the sunshine…it was her favorite to lie in sunny spots.
