# In Memory of Speedy

Speedy

RIP Speedy. He gave us 17.5 years of love and companionship and will forever be remembered by all of us who loved him. His attempts to bust in on our conversations, asserting his presence to make sure he was heard and paid attention to, his pitter patter of his feet as he heads down the stairs to my bedroom to hang out, and so many other things, will be missed for the rest of my life. He was not only a great friend to us all, but a great brother to his sister, Flame, who passed away a couple years before.
