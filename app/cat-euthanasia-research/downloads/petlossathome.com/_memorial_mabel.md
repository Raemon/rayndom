# In Memory of “Mabel”

“Mabel”

Mabel:

“Memories of you, gentle and sweet,

Always my friend, who would chase my feet.

Brave and curious, with caution still there,

Every person you knew, gained affection you would share.

Laughing and learning, we did that together,

Your wisdom and love, I will cherish forever.”
