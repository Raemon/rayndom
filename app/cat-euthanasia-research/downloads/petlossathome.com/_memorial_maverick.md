# In Memory of Maverick

Maverick

We have our many fond memories of our boy. The time flew it seemed like yesterday that we adopted him from the SPCA. Many thank you to you Dr Allegra for coming to Mavericks’s home. He was at complete peace in his home by the fire surrounded by his family. Many thank you for your compassion.  
Very great full  
Maverick’s family David, Lorelei, Tabitha and Russell Harmon
