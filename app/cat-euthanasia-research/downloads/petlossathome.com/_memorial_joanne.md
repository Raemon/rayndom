# In Memory of “Joanne”

“Joanne”

_We found Joanne at a shelter and adopted her when she was two years old. We were lucky to have her with us for 17 years. Over the many years, she saw us through a lot of living with her unconditional love and loud, almost always-on, purr. She was an integral and enduring part of our family – much loved by our children and then our grandchildren. Strangers from vets to groomers to sitters always commented on her sweet and gentle nature. She will always be fondly remembered and dearly missed by her family._
