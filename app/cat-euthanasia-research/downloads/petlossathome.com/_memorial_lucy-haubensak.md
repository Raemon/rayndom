# In Memory of Lucy Haubensak

Lucy Haubensak

Today I lost my companion for the past 15 years. Here’s to Lucy, she gave me everything she possibly could, and then a little bit more. When I first took her home, I promised her I would take care of her for the rest of her days, and I held up my end of the bargain. In return, I received 10 fold.  
I’ll miss you my sweet pup, now go run and play…
