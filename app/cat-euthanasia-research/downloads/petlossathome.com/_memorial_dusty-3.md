# In Memory of “Dusty”

“Dusty”

February 2006 – May 2023  
No longer by my side but forever in my heart. ❤️  
Dusty was peacefully laid to rest at home after suffering from oral squamous cell carcinoma.  
My sweet baby boy was the best birthday gift I will ever receive. He helped me get through dark times and was the only man in my life that I could count on. He was always friendly to people and never bit or hissed at anyone, even if they were testing his patience. He loved cuddling and being warm; whether it was outside in the sun or burrowed under the blankets. His favorite snack ever was bacon; the more fat, the better. He is survived by his mom, grandma, auntie, baby cousin Lilah, and kitty sister Pepper. Rest in paradise, Dusty. I’ll miss you forever.
