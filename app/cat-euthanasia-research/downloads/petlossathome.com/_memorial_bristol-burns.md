# In Memory of “Bristol” Burns

“Bristol” Burns

Bristol – My little black shadow, who was always such a sweetheart and ready to greet everyone you met (especially if they had a treat for you)! Please enjoy playing with your friends, especially Casey who always looked out for you. We love you and miss you so much. xo
