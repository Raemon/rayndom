> Our deepest gratitude to Dr. Mary Ann Bender for her kindness and compassion no only for our beloved for our pet, Molly, but for our family as well. There are no words we can offer to describe how,even though a painful loss for us, it was peaceful passing for our dog.

> I just wanted to let you know through your website / service we just put our dog to rest. Dr. Whisnand came to our house this afternoon and was just a wonderful person. He talked us through what was going to happen and very much put us at ease. He discussed what then would happen to our dog once he left us and where he would take him for the cremation. He addressed our concern without us even asking as far as the respect of his body and that we would receive his ashes. That was HUGE for us. We knew immediately he was a good man and truly cared about the service he was performing. He made a very difficult time much easier. We greatly appreciate his kindness and thoughtfulness and the service he provided at our home.

> Letting you go is the hardest decision I’ve ever had to make. This morning, as your favorite meal is slowly cooking, I have to accept this is the last time I’ll feel your little, warm, furry body, laying beside me. I’m sorry, I couldn’t bare to see you suffer any longer. You’ve been more than a friend, you’ve been my constant for almost half the years I’ve walked this earth. You were there to comfort me in the toughest years of my life and were witness to the brightest. You saw the beginnings of a relationship slowly turn into marriage and you became the eldest brother to my children. Thank you Travis for teaching me that unconditional love can come in all shapes and forms. Go in peace, go with dignity; I will always love you my Travee poo, my chiclé, my good little doggie, my good boy.

> What was a very emotionally painful decision resulted in a peaceful, tranquil ,spiritual ,farewell for my pet and myself. Dr. Moore was caring,gentle,patient,soft spoken and skillful. My pet passed at home surrounded by those who loved him and without fear or stress. This is how I had hoped it would be. We are both at peace.

> I enthusiastically recommend Dr. Moore to provide the best care for one’s pet when it is time to say good bye to one’s beloved pet at home. It was worth every cent.

> My best friend, my funniest little girl and my sweetest little lover was this Millie girl. She will always be my “Mill-Bill.” After her third seizure, she couldn’t walk or shake off the pain anymore. Dr. Ong helped make this a comfortable time to say good bye and let me hold my little girl until all of the suffering and complications of old age freed my old friend’s body forever. Thank you Dr. Ong for helping my Millie leave this earth in peace, and for helping me through a very difficult time. With your help, I was able to say goodbye and know that I had made the right decision for my Mill-Bill.

> Our pet had been ill and we were trying to give her every chance to get better. Suddenly this Monday we could tell it was time. We contacted two of the major vets here in Houston that do home euthanasia , but they were busy. We got a referral to Dr. Ong. On a moment’s notice Dr. Ong made an appointment to see us. Unbelievably, while talking to Dr. Ong our pet passed away. Dr. Ong’s availability and compassion were a great comfort. Thanks again for being there Dr. Ong.
