# In Memory of Xain

Xain

Our dear dog, Xain, left us peacefully in his own environment, surrounded by the people who loved him for over 14 years. If you are ever faced with having to make the decision to put your pet to sleep, I would highly recommend Pet Loss at Home. Dr. Teague was able to come to our home on a Sunday with very little notice. We will always have such gratitude in our hearts for the amount of care and genuine compassion Dr. Teague showed towards us and to our dog, Xain. It was such a peaceful, loving, and pain free experience for our dog. Of course it was a very emotional experience for us to lose our pet, but I can honestly say, Xain did not experience any discomfort whatsoever. Dr. Teague gave us as much time as we needed throughout the entire process and was so kind and understanding. Thank you again, Dr. Teague, for everything. You will always be considered an angel in our lives.
