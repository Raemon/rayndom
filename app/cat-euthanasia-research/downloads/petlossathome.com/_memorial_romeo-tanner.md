# In Memory of “Romeo” Tanner

“Romeo” Tanner

Rest In Peace, Romeo.  
Feeling sad…yet grateful to be given bonus time with him.  
Romeo’s heart was failing in October 2014. His Cardiologist said to expect him to fall over sideways any day now. I was fortunate to know a brilliant Vet/Comparative Pathologist/Physician who is famous for reversing conditions in people and animals.

He gave Romeo a protocol to strengthen his heart, even though there was an inoperable mass on the base of his heart. It worked! He outlived the normal lifespan of a HEALTHY American Bull DOG by a 14 months!

If you would like to see his full story, friend me on Facebook.
