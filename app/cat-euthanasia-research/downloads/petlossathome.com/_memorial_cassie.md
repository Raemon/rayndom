# In Memory of Cassie

Cassie

Hi Gail, Sorry for taking so long to write you back. I was having trouble coming to terms saying good-bye to Cassie. You did an awesome job and I wanted to thank you for you care and compassion. I attached a pic of Cassie on her new dog bed that I got her when she was in Maastricht, Holland with me from 2013-1014. Kind regards, Adam
