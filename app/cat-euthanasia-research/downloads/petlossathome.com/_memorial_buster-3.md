# In Memory of “Buster”

“Buster”

“My Buster crossed over the rainbow bridge with the help from Dr. Christine Scott yesterday. She was so loving and calming to my boy, she explained everything she was going to do and what would happen all the while getting kisses from Buster. He passed in my arms peacefully and pain free. I cannot express how Dr. Scott made a painful fact of life better for Buster and myself.”

Thank you Dr. Scott.
