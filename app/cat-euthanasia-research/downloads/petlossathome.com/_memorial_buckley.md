# In Memory of Buckley

Buckley

Earlier this week Dr. Moore helped us say goodbye to Buckley our constant companion of over 15 years. We adopted him at the Wisconsin Humane Society in December 2002. His unique energetic personality and infectious enthusiasm for life was the focal point of our home; he was loved by everyone. The pain felt in his absence is as enormous as the amount of love he effortlessly inspired within us over the many deeply joyful years we had together. Dr. Moore was extraordinary! Her patience, compassion and expertise ensured the experience of his passing was comforting and peaceful.
