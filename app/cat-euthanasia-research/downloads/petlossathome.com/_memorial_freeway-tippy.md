# In Memory of Freeway & Tippy

Freeway & Tippy

Our boys Freeway and Tippy. We spent 17 wonderful years with them and are heartbroken now that they are gone. We are comforted by the fact that their time to cross to the Rainbow Bridge was the same, no one had to miss the other. Maybe it was something they thought was best. A big thanks to Dr. Carrie Moore for her thoughtfulness and compassion and helping us through this.
