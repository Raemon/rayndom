# In Memory of “Bob”

“Bob”

It is with deep sadness that we inform you our beloved Bob, world’s oldest and largest puppy, passed away peacefully this past Friday morning. It was extremely hard to say “goodbye” but we’re strengthened knowing he has no more pain or maladies, and most importantly, he’s back with his forever puppy brother Sammy. Bob never knew he wasn’t a puppy. He was the best ripe tomato-eating, french fry-eating, and ball-fetcher ever! Bob was a Momma’s boy but he protected our family fiercely. He made a huge paw print on our hearts but we’re grateful to have had almost 14 1/2 years to share with him. See ya Bobber.
