# In Memory of “Daisy”

“Daisy”

“My sweet girl Miss Daisy we miss you so much! For 13 years I loved waking up to your beautiful face every mourning. You had a personality that was so sweet and loving but only on your terms. You had that beagle howl that we loved to listen to but yet you were so gentle. You would get so excited to go for walks, look out the window and lay around with your dog mates. You are now with your best bud Toby and playing together once again. I will always have you in my heart and will remember you everyday. I am so glad that you were apart of our family and we got to spend an amazing 13 years with you! I love you sunshine girl and saying goodbye is never easy but knowing you are no longer suffering gives me peace.”
