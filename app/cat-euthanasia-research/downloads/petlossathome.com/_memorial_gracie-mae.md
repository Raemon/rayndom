# In Memory of “Gracie Mae”

“Gracie Mae”

Gracie Mae Mullins was a loving wonderful 13 year old pit bull/lab mix. Gracie loved treats, snuggling and ripping up furry toys and anything with a zipper!!!!

She was our baby and will be incredibly missed but her spirit will live on always, and she made us laugh right up until the day she left us….

Till we meet again little girl we love you!!!!!
