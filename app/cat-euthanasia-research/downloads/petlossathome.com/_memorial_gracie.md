# In Memory of Gracie

Gracie

Today we said goodbye to our dear sweet Gracie. She was our best friend and companion for over 14 ½ years. She was by our side each and every day and celebrated all of our joys and sorrows as part of our family. She loved every person she ever met and just wanted you to throw her the ball so she could bring it back to you to throw it again and again. Our hearts are so heavy and it hurts so much to let you go, but we know your journey is finished and you are ready to rest in peace. You showed us what unconditional love is and our days will be empty without you but we will never forget and will always keep you in our hearts until we meet again. We Love you.

Thank you Dr. Megan Carolan for your compassion and gentleness in helping Gracie rest in peace.
