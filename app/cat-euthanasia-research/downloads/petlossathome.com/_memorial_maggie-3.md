# In Memory of “Maggie”

“Maggie”

“Maggie was our beloved family dog for almost 16 years. She was so full of personality and filled our days with love. Our sons grew up with her and she played an integral role in the growth of our family, bringing us together with her unconditional love and cuddles. We miss her dearly but are so grateful for all she gave to us. We love you sweet Maggie May and we will see you at the Rainbow Bridge all in due time.”

Thank you for everything!!!! Paw Hugs and kisses to you. XXOO
