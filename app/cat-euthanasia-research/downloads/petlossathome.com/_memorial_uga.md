# In Memory of “Uga”

“Uga”

Uga. 2006-2023  
My darling Uga, Letting you go was the hardest thing I have ever done. And I know you didn’t want to leave me either. But it was time. I love so so much and miss you every second of the day and night. You brought us so much joy and love and ALWAYS made it better. Now and Forever, mine.
