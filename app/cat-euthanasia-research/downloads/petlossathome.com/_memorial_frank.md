# In Memory of Frank

Frank

I lost my friend today. I found Frank as a badly neglected, sickly stray in a shelter. The day I adopted him he was scheduled to be put down. The staff at the shelter estimated he had less than one month to live due to his numerous health problems. Frank the wonder Beagle surprised everyone! He was my loyal and devoted companion for the next 8 years. RIP Frank, and thank you for rescuing me…I’ll meet you at the Rainbow Bridge.
