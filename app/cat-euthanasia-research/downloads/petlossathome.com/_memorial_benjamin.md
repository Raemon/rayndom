# In Memory of Benjamin

Benjamin

It was a very difficult choice we had to make by letting Benjamin go. I did not want him to suffer any longer. We knew it was coming to the end. With the help of Dr. Kinkade we made the choice. She explained everything to us . It was peaceful for all of us. Dr. Kinkade was comforting and understanding. Benjamin’s brother Nico was also here. She handled Benjamin with care and that made us all feel better. My heart is broken but knowing how Benjamin crossed The Rainbow Bridge made us all feel better.  
Thank you Dr. Kinkade
