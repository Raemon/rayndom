# In Memory of “Darby”

“Darby”

Darby

He was named for Darby O’Gil since he was so small as are leprechauns. He was a stray whose family could not be found. We were overjoyed to have him join our family when we already had 2 yellow labs. He had no problem ruling the pack. He brought so much love and joy to our lives; we will never forget him and he’ll always be in our hearts. Love you lil’ buddy.
