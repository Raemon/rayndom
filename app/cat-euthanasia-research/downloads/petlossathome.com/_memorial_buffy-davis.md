# In Memory of “Buffy” Davis

“Buffy” Davis

Buffy, true to her namesake, was a real slayer. She was sickly as a pup. The vet told me later that she never thought Buffy would make it. But she did. When she was about 10 years old, she got anal gland cancer. Like a true slayer, she conquered that, too. She was 13 when she went to the Rainbow Bridge. (Kidney failure.) She was and is loved. She is missed by her whole family. She will always be in our hearts forever and ever. You couldn’t find a sweeter dog. I swear, her tail ran on a motor because it was always wagging. Even when she was sick.

Buffy – wherever you are – I hope you have lots and lots of treats and large fields in which to run. We will never, ever forget you.
