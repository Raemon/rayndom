# In Memory of “Maisy” Peterson

“Maisy” Peterson

“We were so grateful that Maisy was able to spend her last day in her home surrounded by everyone that loved her. We called her “Chooch” because she reminds us of the Little Engine That Could and never gave up trying to enjoy life. She was happiest chasing her ball in the backyard, swimming in the pond, and being with her mom & dad taking naps. Maisy truly is the heart of our home and is missed every day. We love you Chooch!”
