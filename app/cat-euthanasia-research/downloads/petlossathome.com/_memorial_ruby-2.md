# In Memory of “Ruby”

“Ruby”

“During her 10 years in our family, we watched Ruby transform from a scared rescue puppy to an adventurous, loving, trusting dog.

She loved laying in the sunshine, frozen broccoli, giving hugs (never kisses), butt scratches, hiking, windshield wipers, and feeding the birds.

Ruby was intelligent, memorizing the names of all of her toys and learning countless tricks.  
Ruby was adventurous, always ensuring she walked in front of us on hikes, and learning to swim after years of fearing the water.  
Ruby was hilarious. We’d often find her lying in contorted positions, staring at us out of the corner of her eye, making silly vocalizations, and initiating play-fights. Not a day went by that she didn’t make us laugh.  
Most of all, Ruby was loving. Every day, she would lay in bed and snuggle up to us, nuzzling her snout into our faces. When her kitty sister was sick and laid down in her bed, Ruby, without missing a beat, laid down in the cat’s tiny bed, tucking herself into a ball to fit. If one of us were out of town, she would leap into our arms whining, the moment we walked through the door. She allowed me to cry into her fur during my hardest days, and was her mom’s shadow. Ruby loved unconditionally and made friends with all who knew her.

In one of her more memorable moments, Ruby got loose in the backyard and “ran away.” After frantically looking for her, we found her wagging her tail on the front porch, trying to get back into the house. From her first to her last day in our home, Ruby was my soulmate, sister, kindred spirit, adventure buddy, and best friend.

Seeing the world through Ruby’s eyes has been the privilege of a lifetime.  
We love you forever and ever Ruby Roo.”
