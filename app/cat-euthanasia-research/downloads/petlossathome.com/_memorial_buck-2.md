# In Memory of “Buck”

“Buck”

“Buck was an integral part of our family. He survived everything life gave him with grace and dignity. He was dedicated to protecting his veteran Dad. He loved of his Mom’s hugs and kisses and sitting in the yard with her just watching cars go by. Buck’s yard was filled with “his birds” and “his squirrels” who ran around while he would lay in the yard, knowing he was the gentlest of giants and let them enjoy his yard with him. He loved his grandkids and showered them with lots of love and kisses. He hated his picture taken but not when his grandkids were in them. And boy did he smile! We will miss or Bucky Boy, ole Buckaroo, our big boy, our best boy, for the rest of our lives.”
