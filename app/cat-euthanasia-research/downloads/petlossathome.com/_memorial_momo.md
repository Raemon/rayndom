# In Memory of Momo

Momo

Last night we said goodbye to our fiercely loyal, stranger danger prone and mostly goofy Momo. We loved him and he loved his (self-identified) human family including Memaw, Papa, Grandma, Molly, Max, Carl and his newer friend Danielle. He knew his pack and never barked at us when we came through the door. A part of our hearts left with Momo last night as Rachel and I held him until the end. The other part of his pack (Trinity and Katie-Dog) seem to understand what has happened too. It was time for him to go and meet some new friends Snoopy, Copper, Jack, Tonka and Monroe. We give thanks for his life with us and we trust that we will be reunited one day.
