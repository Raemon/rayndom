# In Memory of Stella

Stella

Hello Rob and Karen…….I just wanted to send you a note about my dog Stella. Dr. Mary Ann Bender so graciously and compassionately came to my house Sunday to let my Stella end her pain and move on to a better place. 

Mary Ann was wonderful with Stella, my other dog Harley and my friends who chose to be with me during this very emotional time. I couldn’t have chosen a more perfect person to help me let her go.

I am heartbroken and miss Stella so much but am comforted by so many wonderful friends and family and of course Harley. I know Stella is in a better place, free of pain and happy again.

Thank you for providing this service. I will recommend this to everyone I know. Not that it makes it easier, but it did make it more comfortable and I am sure was less stress on everyone and Stella in the end.

Chris Walton
