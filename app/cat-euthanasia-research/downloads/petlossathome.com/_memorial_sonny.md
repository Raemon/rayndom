# In Memory of Sonny

Sonny

Our almost 14 year old yellow lab Sonny passed yesterday over the rainbow bridge. He was the most gentle, sweet, loving and loyal companion anyone could ever ask for. We want to thank Dr. Donna O’Leary’s for her compassion and kindness in making Sonny’s passing a quick and painless one. Sonny was surrounded by his loved ones in his own home. We will always be grateful for the serene and quiet setting during this difficult time. RIP my angel boy
