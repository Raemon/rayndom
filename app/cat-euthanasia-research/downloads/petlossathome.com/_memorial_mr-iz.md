# In Memory of Mr. Iz

Mr. Iz

My Dear Forever Best Friend, Mr.Iz,

I hope you made it home to your new surroundings on rainbow bridge and are forever playing with Molly. I’m sorry you had to struggle with cancer but I hope you are not uncomfortable anymore and are happy. You truly were my world and I will forever love and miss you. You are my forever Best Friend and will always be in my heart.

Until we meet again Mr.Iz

Love; Mum

~Amy~
