# In Memory of “Buster” Moran

“Buster” Moran

I wanted to thank Dr Bender for easing our beloved Buster over the Rainbow Bridge. Diagnosed with cancer, he hung on for another 3 months to give us more love. Dr Bender addressed our concerns and assured us that Buster’s quality of life was not what it should be and that we were absolutely making the right decision. A beautiful paw print keepsake and a lock of his fur were the most precious gifts to remember our beloved member of the family. Thank you for your insight and compassion. We will recommend this service to anyone needing it.

Cindy and Paul Moran
