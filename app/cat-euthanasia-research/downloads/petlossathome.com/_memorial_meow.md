# In Memory of Meow

Meow

Meow was an angel on earth before she was an angel in heaven. She was a one in a million dog who always gave so much love and joy to everyone who met her. Like any other dog, Meow loved walks. As she got older, Meow especially enjoyed taking breaks during her walks to rest. She’d find a nice spot, sit down, let the breeze sweep her face and watch the world turn. It was wonderful to sit with her and enjoy the moment together. Meow was the greatest gift ever given to my family and we hope that all families can be as lucky as us to have a pet as special as her.
