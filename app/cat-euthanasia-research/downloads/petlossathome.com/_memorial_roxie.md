# In Memory of Roxie

Roxie

You had just turned 13 two days before you had to leave, and 10 1/2 years of those were with me. Lucky me! That may seem like a long time, little girl, but in the end, it wasn’t. I would have loved many more years with you. You were the best little dog your daddy ever could have hoped for. I talk about you every day since you went to the Bridge, and I tell everyone what a good girl you were. Everybody who knew you already knew that! In the end, I’m glad I made the right choice for you, and quickly, so that you didn’t have to suffer as the cancer would have made you do. Dr. Monica was your new best friend when she came to take care of you, sending you to the Bridge peacefully on my lap. Daddy misses you and loves you, now and forever!
