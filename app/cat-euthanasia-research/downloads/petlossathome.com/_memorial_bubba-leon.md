# In Memory of “Bubba” Leon

“Bubba” Leon

“Bubba was a very sweet and gentle dog that brought so much love into our lives for 9 1/2 wonderful years. Then he lost his battle with brain cancer after a courageous 6 month fight. I would like to thank Dr. Rachel Thauberger for helping him pass away peacefully at home surrounded by his family and animal friends. It meant a lot to us that he could spend his last moments on earth in familiar surroundings and surrounded by everyone and everything he loved.”
