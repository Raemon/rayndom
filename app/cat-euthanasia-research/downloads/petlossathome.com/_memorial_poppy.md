# In Memory of Poppy

Poppy

“Oh Poppy, We miss you so much! You were such a sweet girl who got along with everyone and everything! You were truly an angel to be around! We are so grateful to have known you and to be able to be in your presence! You were always such a happy smiling girl! We will miss you greeting us at the door and doing your spin right before you were ready to lead the way on our walks! You and those pretty blue eyes will never be forgotten! May you find endless treats and walks over the rainbow.”
