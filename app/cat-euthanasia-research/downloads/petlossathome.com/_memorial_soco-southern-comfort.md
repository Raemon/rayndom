# In Memory of “Soco” (Southern Comfort)

“Soco” (Southern Comfort)

“Soco was a sassy lady with a lot of love to give. She blessed me with 16 years of memories and watched me grow from a young 7 year old into a young man of 22. For me, I watched her grow from a young kitten to a 17 lbs. chubster and then a snuggly elder. We loved each other unconditionally. Even when we would annoy each other, we would quickly be snuggled up and showing affection right after. Growing up with all older brothers, she was my only sister. And when my brothers moved, Soco and I were there for each other. With her love I never felt lonely. She is my world and will always be my baby.”  
With love,  
Soco’s favorite person
