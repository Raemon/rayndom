> I want to thank Dr. Carrie Moore for her kindness and compassion during the whole process of putting our family dog, Gunner, to sleep. We didn’t know what to expect. Carrie explained everything ever step of the way. She made the unbearable bearable. I will recommend Carrie and Pet Loss at Home to anyone in need of this service.

> Greetings, my name is Howard Rogers. Recently I met Dr. Holly. She is just wonderful. She took care of my dog with such compassion and commitment. What a great person to have on board. Thank you to all involved.

> We were so grateful to Dr. Durfee and the way he helped us say goodbye to our beloved boy Jake in the comfort of our home. He was very helpful and respectful. He made a difficult thing easier to do.

> We had to make the very difficult and absolutely heartbreaking decision to end our sweet 14 1/2 yr old Missy’s recent suffering. I dreaded it since the day we got her and didn’t know how we would cope. Due to COVID and her fear of going to the Vet, we decided having this happen at home would be best for us. I am so glad we did. Dr. Gayle Larson came to our home and was so kind. I would highly recommend this service, although it was absolutely devastating, our whole family was able to be there and spend time with our pups and it couldn’t have been more peaceful. It hasn’t even been a week yet and I still cry daily but if I am ever able to get another pet, I would not hesitate when the time came to use this service again. Thank you Dr. Gayle so much for giving us that comfort and compassion.

> Our family encountered the tough, tough, tough decision to ease the bone cancer pain our beloved TJ was suffering through. Dr. Phil arrived at our residence with compassion, care and patience. Thank you Dr. Phil for your heartwarming professionalism as we said our goodbyes to our most loved TJ. Highly recommend Dr. Phil and his services.

> Tomorrow marks 1 year since I had to say goodbye to the furry love of my life. Dr. Holly came to our home and I cannot even begin to say how much I appreciate her and how thoughtful, patient and kind she was. It has taken this long for me to be able to really talk about things but it has always remained in my mind just how grateful I was and still am for her.  
>  After 18 years together, I miss my sweet boy with every ounce of me and I still struggle every single day. I am forever thankful though that he passed away in his home and in his mommy’s loving arms.

> “We had to put our beagle down today. Dr. Gail was such a sweetheart and I couldn’t have asked for anyone else. I highly recommend her! If my other pets pass I will be using her! Thank you Gail for being compassionate and super friendly.”

> I am so grateful this service is here for those who truly want it. Dr. Holly was a god send through this difficult time. I truly believe this is how our loved one should be able to cross that bridge, in their home where all the great memories are for them and their family. It was breaking my heart to have to say goodbye as it was, to take him to the place that he had so many visits over the last month shaking every time I took him, it was too much for me to bare. Saying our final goodbye there, and him feeling afraid and confused was not what I wanted for him. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for this service. We miss you terribly Buster but you will always be in our hearts.

> Thank you to Dr Gail Larson for coming to our home last night to help us say goodbye to our kitty, Salem. He was about 18 years old and I had him since he was a kitten. He was and will always be my little baby. Even during this time of Covid, Dr Gail came to our house and made our saying good bye peaceful. He suffered from heart and recently kidney disease. He was ready to go to be with his brother Oreo. Many tears fell and will continue to fall but I know he rests peacefully.

> Thank you again for your kindness.

> Pet Loss at Home helped us go through this very painful farewell step. Dr. Amores was very kind and compassionate. They helped us our very “last minute” request. It makes a huge difference to say good by to your beloved companions from home instead of a cold metal table at a Vet hospital…

> “Thank-you to you and Dr. Bingham for letting Olives cross the rainbow bridge.”

> We were so grateful to say good bye to our belongings bed friend in the comfort of his home Figaro had been recently diagnosed with cancer and we were worried that we were saying good bye too soon. Not only did Sandra Coon, DVM, gave us reassurance from a medical perspective but she made us feel reassured that it was time. She gave dignity, compassion and kindness in our time if need.

> “Dr. Fouts is a Rockstar in her field. She was amazingly responsive when we contacted her on a Sunday morning for our kitty. She showed genuine concern and was a wonderful resource to assist in the grief process. Our kitty’s comfort was top of her mind only rivaled by her compassion for the humans. Losing a pet is awful, but allowing the pet to pass in the comfort of its own home surrounded by the people that cared for it is without a doubt the preferred way when the time comes. Thank you!”  
>  Matt Bilbrey

> I contacted Dr Ashley Emanuele on a Sunday after seeing that my beloved rescue dog Raegan who was diagnosed with kidney failure, took a turn for the worse. She answered her phone right away (On.A.Sunday). I had Dr Emanuele on speaker so that the rest of my family could hear her explain the process of euthanasia, and after having spoken to other vets, we knew Dr Emanuele was “the one”. She seemed so warm & so compassionate. She offered her condolences & explained in detail all the aftercare services she provided.  
>  When Dr Emanuele arrived the following morning, she arrived on schedule & with such care & compassion, she again described the peaceful process of euthanasia. It was so hard to say goodbye to a member of our family. She saw how sad & upset we were, & made us feel confident that the decision our family has made was in the best interest & love for our dog. There was no hope for recovery & choosing to euthanize was the greatest gift we could give our baby so she did not have to suffer. Dr Emanuele understood our sadness & respected our need for time with Raegan before she passed on. She gave us all the time we needed to love on Raegan & say goodbye.  
>  Dr Emanuele took great care of Raegan in her final moments & for this we are forever grateful. Dr Emanuele, 5 stars to you for being a 5 star Vet. I highly recommend in-home euthanasia. Thank you again.

> We wanted to thank Dr. Tami for getting us a quick appointment and Dr. Bender for her compassion when we made the decision to euthanize our beloved pet Memphis. Even though our hearts are heavy with sadness , we feel the right decision was made at the right time. I would highly recommend these vets to anyone who needs to make the decision as we did.
> 
> Thank you! Rest in peace, Memphis!

> I cannot begin to say how wonderful Dr. Phil Whisnand was, from his Professional and caring manner from the first phone call, to after receiving our pets ashes. He made us feel like our pet loss was his loss too. Thank you Dr. Phil, You made the terrible loss of our pet, tolerable. Gods blessings.

> > Our sweet dog Daisy was with us for 14 years. She was a part of our family, a sweet little girl who was always looking for treats and snuggles.
>> 
>> When we noticed her health was in decline and her quality of life was negatively impacted, we made the difficult decision to put her down. After our last experience putting down our senior dog at a vet’s office, we hoped there was a different option for us this time around. After doing some research, we were so thankful to find Dr. Mendelsohn. We contacted her, she returned a call promptly, she educated us about her services, and we made the appointment. While this decision was a difficult one, Dr. Mendelsohn made the process easier because she was such a compassionate vet. She was a consummate professional throughout the entire process. What ended up being just as important to us is that she helped us to feel seen, heard and valued through the process. We could not have asked for anyone to be more respectful and kind to our dog Daisy. We were thankful for a different experience this time around, one that was very honoring to our beloved pet. If you are struggling with the decision but know that it is the most humane thing to do for your pet, we highly recommend Dr. Mendelsohn.

> Our beloved 15 1/2 year old kitty had lymphoma. We knew it was her time and had actually scheduled with another in-home service for later in the week, but when things started to go downhill quickly, we needed to put her to sleep sooner. The service we’d planned to use didn’t have same-day availability, nor did several other services. We contacted Dr. Larson and she was able to come out to our house within a couple hours. She was so kind and compassionate, and the process was peaceful for our kitty. We couldn’t have asked for anything more and are so thankful Dr. Larson was able to help us on such short notice. It would have been devastating to watch our kitty suffer any longer or to have to bring her to an emergency vet.

> Wonderful. Absolutely the best people in the world during this most heart wrenching time.  
>  I just want to Thank Drs Allison and McInerney for their response to my voicemail with the upmost delicacy and heartfelt words.  
>  Dr. Ayala was the kindest soul to help us walk our 14 year old baby Rylee over the rainbow bridge.  
>  Thankyou to you all for doing this beautiful service.  
>  Everything was perfect – and the beautiful wooden box his cremations came back in is also perfect.  
>  Everything felt like it was done with LOVE.  
>  I can’t recommend this enough to anyone considering this service.

> I want to thank Christine so so much for everything today. Our baby girl Aries was recently diagnosed with cancer. Within a few months we had to make the decision to have our sweet girl laid to rest. Christine was so sweet and kind. Very compassionate and explained everything to us very kindly. She was amazing with giving us time to process everything as it was happening. We appreciate you Christine, you were an angel.

> Thank you Sandra. As much pain as we are in we know we made the right decision. You were FANTASTIC and made a incredibly sad situation feel less sad. I will highly recommend you. You made everything bearable for us. Thank you for everything. You are truly an angel. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
> 
> I can’t thank you enough for helping us say goodbye to Moxie. You made a day that I have been dreading very special. I feel complete peace in her passing, mostly because of your reassurance that it was time. Please keep up the great work!!!❤️❤️

> Saying goodbye to my 13-year-old boy Stripes was not easy, but I’m glad he got the peaceful send off that he deserved. Dr. Johnny was incredibly patient and compassionate, and he made sure that Stripes was not afraid or in pain when it was time. Thanks for everything.

> We are so grateful for the care and kindness Dr. Durfee showed us and our sweet “oldest son” Bentley. We have three young boys and Dr Durfee took time to explain to them what he was going to do and what to expect. He also gave us better understanding of heart failure. This gave us a lot of peace in our decision to not make Bentley suffer any longer. I would recommend Dr Durfee to anyone looking to say goodbye to their loved pet in the peace of their own home. Although we are mourning and miss our guy, we couldn’t have asked for a better experience letting him move on. Thanks again Dr Durfee for your kindness.  
>  The Nielsen Family

> Pet Loss at Home was extremely helpful in this devastating time. It was our sweet little angel’s time to go and while we are in a Pandemic, the wonderful vets at Gardens Animal Hospital were only allowing 1 person to go back with her. We just couldn’t accept that and decided to reach out to Pet loss at home. They were able to help us right away. Dr. Tracey was very kind, compassionate, and communicated everything clearly to us. It was the peaceful goodbye we needed. Thank you Dr. Tracey and Pet Loss at home for this service that you provide.
