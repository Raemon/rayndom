> “We are so grateful for your in-home service. The vet was very caring and informed us all of what to expect. Your service allowed our kitty to be in the comfort of his own home and to make his passing as least stressful as possible, surrounded by those who loved him most. Thank you again, and I would very much recommend to you to others.”

> “I wanted to reach out and say thank you to Dr Lou for being so kind, supportive and flexible while we had to say goodbye to our cat Carmel. It was over the Thanksgiving weekend and a hard time to let go of our 20 year old cat. Dr Lou helped us in such a calm and reassuring way and I will forever be grateful he was there during a difficult time.  
>  Pet Loss at Home, but mostly, Dr Lou truly helped make the transition a little easier.”

> “I couldn’t have asked for a kinder more compassionate vet to help my boy cross the rainbow bridge on 12/20/23. Dr. Darden is amazing. When I got him back I was amazed at all she brought back with him and I’m very appreciative for all she did.”

> “You owe it to your pet to get this service❤️ they are truly amazing people who want nothing more than to help you and your pet”

> “It has only been a little over a week since our Zoey left us, but I felt it necessary to write this testimonial. Dr. Shields provided a caring, empathetic and safe space for her to pass. The devastation is real and he understands that. Initially, she lost the use of her back legs, but the next day she was walking normal. When I called Dr. Shields, he said “I think she has more time.” He was right and we got more than an additional week with her. Once she couldn’t walk for two days, he agreed it was time. He came right away, no waiting, no anxiety he got to our house two hours later. He tolerated her growling, scratches and attempting to bite, she was scared and that killed me but I’ve had to say goodbye to previous pets in an office, this was much more personal and better for her. I cry every day because I miss her so, Dr. Shields made this awful event that much easier and left us with a paw print and her ashes were returned in a timely manner in a beautiful urn. Thank you Dr. Shields!”

> “We love our pets so deeply that making the decision to say goodbye is one of the hardest we ever make. Dr. Christina Kincade from Pet Loss at Home truly helped us get through the experience with compassion, kindness and knowledge. Being able to gently send our 10- year old Berner on his way from his favorite spot at home was an extraordinary gift. I would strongly recommend Pet Loss at Home to any pet parent at the end of their pet’s life.”

> “The Vet was so kind and gentle with my Maggie! I love that I was not rushed to say goodbye and the vet was so compassionate. I definitely recommend that people turn to your business when having to put their pets down at home.”

> “Dr. Ong, thank you for your compassion and professionalism. Saying good bye to our family dog was incredibly difficult for everyone, but you walked us through the process and gave us time to grieve and celebrate.”

> “ _Dr. Teague came to our home to help us say goodbye to our beloved Trigger. He was personable, patient & caring, instantly putting us at ease. He explained the process & allowed us all the time we needed to say our goodbyes. Trigger just fell asleep & went peacefully, which was my biggest worry. Triggers ashes were returned a week later in the most beautiful sealed wooden box engraved with his name. I couldn’t recommend a better doctor than Dr. Teague & couldn’t be happier with the service he provided during such a heart-wrenching and difficult time. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.”_

> “It has been over a year since we bid a sweet farewell to our dear cat, Ollie. To say that Dr. Innis made the sad task easier is an understatement. She checked Ollie gently and thoroughly. She gave us our options and explained all the steps of each. Her patience waiting for us to decide was such a kindness. We could not have made our decision to let him go on his way without Dr. Innis’ gentleness and of course medical expertise. He was a companion for decades and will always be remembered as the gentle, quirky foundling kitty who was our dear little pal. We will always miss and love him – Lynn”

> “We adopted Porter when she was 3 years old from Maxfund in Denver. She enjoyed 15 wonderful years with our family. She started having issues walking when she turned 18. 7 months later our family woke up and found Porter unable to get up or stand by herself. We contacted Pet Loss at Home that morning and were able to get an appointment the next morning. Porter was spoiled rotten the entire day (bacon, stake and lots of love). The doctor was very compassionate and understanding. He made Porter comfortable and we all held her as she passed on to her next life. When the doctor brought her ashes back they were in a beautiful wooden box with her name engraved on the side. I can’t thank you enough for your compassion and caring in helping our Porter girl find her peace.”  
>  Thank you and God bless.

> “Dr. Kinkade was amazing. She was perfectly caring and professional. We were able to make arrangements quickly and easily – she called in response to my email within minutes and we subsequently texted to confirm final plans. Our yellow lab, Baxter, was even excited to see her when he sensed her presence in the house a couple hours later. She immediately gave him a big hug and we knew he was in good hands. So grateful for this service, to have those final precious moments in the comfort of home, spoiling our pup with his favorite foods and watching him fall asleep in peace. I can’t thank Dr. Kinkade enough and I highly recommend utilizing this service whenever possible.”

> “I had to euthanize my cat who was only about to turn five years old due to acute renal failure. It was absolutely devastating. Dr. Carrie Moore was amazing, though, and I’m very happy I wound up using this service. My cat was able to pass away peacefully on my lap, and that meant the world to me rather than having it done in a vet clinic. The empathy and sensitivity of Dr. Moore made the horrifying experience a little more bearable. The next time I have to make the dreadful decision, I would not hesitate to use this service again.

> “I just wanted to let you know that Maryanne did an AMAZING job for me. She went over & beyond when I didn’t hear back quick enough from the vet (I was just being impatient under the circumstances). I know how businesses work but if she’s up for a review/raise, I truly hope you consider giving her a little extra because she has earned it.
> 
> Genuinely hard working people are hard to find these days and she’s a keeper! 🙂
> 
> I also posted a review on Yelp because I will definitely be referring Pet Loss at Home to my fellow animal owners.”

> “After a few weeks of health trouble for our baby boy, we reached out to Dr. Bingham in Albuquerque through Pet Loss at Home. She was very gentle, soothing, and loving towards our boy right to the end. She even joined us in giving him a final kiss to say goodbye, then very carefully got him ready to take to her car. My young cat could not have been in better hands. It’s tough to make the call, but Dr. Bingham was here for us and him every step of the way.”

> “We were so upset to have to call for this service. But Dr. O’Leary made it so much easier to put our Bailey at peace. She comforted us as well as Bailey. He was a very family oriented dog and always by our sides. Our Family was present and we were glad he went into the light with us and being in his beloved home. Thank you so much Dr. O’Leary.”

> We sadly had to lay our old girl to rest yesterday, August 14, 2023. She’s been a part of our family for 14 years. We felt it was her time due to old age health issues, as well as fighting arthritis the last few years. Dr. Rachel was available to come within a few hours notice; she was very professional and compassionate. She helped our baby transition into the life of no more pain and suffering. Thank you so much for your services and easing our transition.

> Hello,  
>  Dr. Gail came to our home today to help us say goodbye to our precious Lucky. She was very kind and compassionate. We were so grateful to have the opportunity to be with him at home at the end. We sat in the sun on the deck and it was very peaceful. We appreciate the service that you offer. Dr. Gail was very wonderful and I will pass your info on to any family & friends looking for your services.  
>  Thanks, Jennie Zafft

> “Sadly we had to put our girl Mia down yesterday. She had been declining drastically and yesterday morning we knew it was time. We looked into a number of places that would come to our home. Around 9am I requested an apt online and also called the number that directed me to someone available in our area. We got a call around 11am and Dr. Tammy was at our house by 3pm. She was absolutely amazing and truly helped guide us and give us comfort through the whole process. Of course everyone dreads this and in our situation we’ve kind of been mentally prepared since April but no one’s ever truly prepared for losing their fur baby. Dr. Tammy is very patient and passionate and we really couldn’t of asked for a better experience with such a sad and vulnerable time. Thank you so much!”

> Dr. Christine Scott is a true angel placed on this world to help our beloved pets to cross over the rainbow bridge and at the same time providing comfort to pet owners who have broken hearts because we ultimately don’t know how to say goodbye. I had my precious Chrissy since she was 6 weeks old and we made the decision to help her cross over she was 18 years old. My precious girl helped me to go through the tragic unexpected death of my 40 year daughter 2 years ago. She just allowed me to cuddle with her and hold her tight while my tears were running like a river. I could see however that my Chrissy was having several health issues none of which were curable. Dr. Christine Scott came to our home, assessed my Chrissy and explained that my baby needed to go over the rainbow bridge. I’m certain that my daughter in heaven is taking care of my Chrissy and they both are waiting for my home coming. I truly would not have been able to give my precious Chrissy the truly loving goodbye without Dr. Christine Scott. I highly recommend Dr. Christine Scott to anyone that needs to give your dear beloved fur baby a dignified and respectful way to cross over the rainbow bridge. Thank you Dr. Christine Scott for everything that you have done to help take the sting out of the final goodbye.”

> Hello,
> 
> Dr. Sandra Coon came to our home today in Washington state for home euthanasia services. Our pet’s name is Clyde.
> 
> She was amazing and helped put our English Mastiff Clyde to his final long sleep today. I was wondering if your company supplied receipts, as I forgot to ask Dr. Coon at the time of her visit. Clyde has pet insurance and I would like to submit a receipt for today (euthanasia and cremation) for documentation.
> 
> Also, I was wondering if you knew what mortuary/crematory Clyde is being prepped at in Washington state. This may sound silly but he has never gone an evening away from home in his 8 years of life. Just knowing where he is would help us emotionally – he was our main mastiff.
> 
> Thanks so much,  
>  Jamie Olaf

> My sweet Capone was fine one week, rolling around on his back and being his crazy, spontaneous self and the next week he was having trouble breathing and taking seizures. I heard of a place that did at home services but it did not provide to my location. They directed me here,Pet Loss at Home. I believe everything happens for a reason.  
>  Dr. Levy got back to me very quickly and came to our house the next day to help use understand what we were dealing with.  
>  Capone is a bulldog so he is always running up to people, jumping, smelling, nudging lol. But not with Dr. Levy. Capone greated her right away with tons of kisses and was very comfortable with her. He was loving her up and so calm. This brought so much comfort to my husband and I as we felt like Capone knew she was there to help him.  
>  I also have 3 young boys who were very upset with having to put their pup down. Dr. Levy was so understanding, played with my kids, answered all our questions and made us comfortable with our decision because Capone was not living a good quality of life. He could not get excited without his breathing being an issue. She was so patient with us as we took a while to make that decision no one ever wants to make.  
>  I can not thank Dr.Levy enough for her kind soul.  
>  The Eckman Family

> “Thank you Dr Scott and pet loss at home. We are so glad that we found out about pet loss at home. When we found out that our cat, Peaches, had cancer and not treatable we immediately said that we would not make you get into her carrier and go to the vet when the time came because she did not like going out. It stressed her out so much and I did not want that to be her last moments! Then I came across your web page. Dr Scott was absolutely wonderful! She got to know about Peaches as well as us. She was there to care for our cat as well as support and comfort us through this difficult time. No doubt that this is her passion and what she should be doing. She helped to make this as peaceful as possible. As I held my sweet kitty cat with my husband beside us, Peaches was able to cross the rainbow bridge in the comfort of her home in one of her favorite spots to cuddle. I cannot say enough how much we appreciate the care and compassion.
> 
> Thank you Dr Scott!”

> “We had to say goodbye to a beloved little friend yesterday, Buster was in stage three kidney disease when we adopted him a little over a year ago. Over that year he became such a big part of our family and our hearts.
> 
> As he entered kidney failure we made the always heartbreaking decision to let him go, and wanted to do so at home and give him the gentlest goodbye we could. We live in a pretty rural community, not many vets were willing to come to us, but that’s what we really wanted to do for him.
> 
> We had Dr Sandra Coon come out, and she was wonderful. My five year old son was able to be included, we talked about it a lot in advance as to what would happen to Buster and what to expect, and while we were both upset and crying the experience was the best we could ask for. She gave us tips on how to keep him distracted for the initial sedative, we got to hold him the whole time and say goodbye privately. When he had passed she gave us a blanket to wrap him in, then we placed him in a basket and my son and I were able to walk him to the car and wave him goodbye. Our other two dogs were also able to say goodbye and I genuinely think that helped provide closure for my son and them.
> 
> Dr Coon was compassionate and professional the whole time, she gave us space to grieve and made his transition as seamless and gentle as possible. She made sure we knew what to expect and what she was doing the whole time she was in our home. It’s always the hardest thing to do to say goodbye, but using Pet Loss at Home made it as peaceful as it could possibly be.”
