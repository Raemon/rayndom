# In Memory of “Snoopy”

“Snoopy”

“Snoopy was a wonderful family member and we were lucky he picked us at the shelter. It was difficult for us to realize it was Snoop’s time to run free. Dr. Holly was very supportive when we made the decision. She explained how she handled the process and allowed us to take our time with our beloved pup.

We will miss Snoop forever to include the walks he loved and snuggling with us on the couch. I would highly recommend Dr. Holly-she is kind and was wonderful with our pup!”
