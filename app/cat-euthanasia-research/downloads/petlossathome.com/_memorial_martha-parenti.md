# In Memory of “Martha” Parenti

“Martha” Parenti

Last week Monday, I had to put the joy of my life, my cat Martha, down. It was an excrutiatingly difficult thing to do, to let go of someone who had been a daily part of your life for 16 years, but honestly it probably should have been done several weeks earlier. Martha had been failing for some time, but I couldn’t bring myself to make the call. Ultimately, I’m glad I did. I could not be more pleased with the job done by Dr. Megan Carolan who came to my house that Monday evening. She was patient, kind, extremely gentle and understanding. She made the whole process much more bearable. I highly recommend her to anyone here in the Chicago area who is faced with making a similar difficult decision.
