# In Memory of “Callie (Cat)”

“Callie (Cat)”

Hi I’m Callie Cat,  
I was pampered for 17 years, I got to play with so many toys, I even had my own luggage for when mom n dad traveled, I never went with but I claimed a suitcase and never gave it back and my favorite thing to do was snuggle and eat my wet food..

Callie will be deeply missed we Love her so much and she brought us so many memories.. She will always be in our hearts, We Miss and Love you honey..  
Rick/Jen
