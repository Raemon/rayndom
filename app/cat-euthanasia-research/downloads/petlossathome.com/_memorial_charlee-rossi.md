# In Memory of “Charlee” Rossi

“Charlee” Rossi

We will definitely miss “Charlee” the loveable teddy bear all the kids and everyone was always glad to see coming. He was one in a million, truly a member of the family and will be missed dearly.

Taken to early he can now play in the water and run all day long without ever tiring. We will never forget you.

We would like to especially Thank Dr. Mary Ann Bender for her commitment to make Charlee’s passing the easiest it could be. In our opinion she went above and beyond to make sure everyone as well as Charlee was comfortable in the graceful passing that took place.
