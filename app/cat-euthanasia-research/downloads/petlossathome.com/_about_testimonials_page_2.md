> “Christine made a heartbreaking situation as beautiful and peaceful as possible. She’s so kind and amazing. I’m forever grateful.”

> “You are truly a blessing. You are so kind, compassionate and loving with my family. Thank you so much, for taking your time to be sure we all are very comfortable. Our girl crossed the rainbow with 15 year old. Thank you for everything. God bless you.”

> “Dr. Bender came to my home today to put down my sweet 13 yr old dalmatian Chloe. Dr. Bender made the time in her super busy schedule to come out immediately. She first explained in great detail what she needed to do and took her time (allowing us to take our time as well).  
>  She was extremely professional, empathetic, and I very highly recommend her to anyone in need!  
>  My dog would get super stressed out going to the vets office and knew as soon as we pulled into the lot. So, I can’t thank Dr Bender enough, for allowing my sweet girl to pass so peacefully in her own home and not in a vet’s office!”

> “Dr. Holly was wonderful. My dog Mickey came to us 2 years ago as a terrified, shaking, senior dog. He hated the car. He had been rescued with 3 other dogs from a farm where animals were being shot. It took months for him to accept us, but when he did, his personality shined on all of us. He was a big wonderful fluffy boy! The last thing I wanted to do was traumatize him again with another car ride. Dr. Holly helped us ease his pain and he was able to die in his favorite cozy place while being petted and loved. Dr. Holly was so professional and helpful. She was also very prepared. Thank you so very much!”

> “Dr. Decter was compassionate and professional. She walked us through everything and answered all our questions. We didn’t feel rushed and were fortunate to spend our dog’s last moment together. She passed eating peanut butter, her favorite food.”
> 
> Thank you Dr. Decter. 🙏

> > “We recently had to say goodbye to our 18+ y/o Rat Terrier, Chewy. We were assisted by Dr. Bingham, who did more for us that day than I’ll ever to be able to adequately explain. She was simply amazing.
> 
> My husband had been dreading this for years, and had long ago asked me to make any necessary arrangements. I knew how anxious a once-loved car ride made Chewy in his final months and couldn’t do anything in his final hours that would add to it- that would’ve been just heartbreaking.
> 
> Instead, we spent Chewys’ last 90 minutes loving on him like crazy, talking to him and pouring out our love. He passed peacefully and calmly, in the home he loved, surrounded by us and his two ‘sisters’ . It was truly a beautiful and poignant event, one we’ll never forget.
> 
> My husband and I can not thank Pet Loss at Home and Dr Bingham ENOUGH for their compassionate, kind service. I had never thought it possible to be so touched and feel so blessed when losing our boy, but Pet Loss at Home and Dr Bingham, especially, made this into something so heartfelt and moving.”
> 
> From the bottom of our hearts, thank you.

> “We recently had our dog Maya put down at home through your company. Having many dogs throughout our lives, this was the first time we chose to do it at home. The experience was amazing.
> 
> Dr Michael Leverone came to our home within a day. He was very compassionate and professional. He even personally delivered Mayas remains within a few days. Thank you so much for the great experience.”
> 
>   
> Sincerely, Randy and Maureen Townsend

> “I’ll be forever grateful to Dr. Alicia Darden for the kindness and compassion she showed me on one of the worst days of my life. Having to say goodbye to your best friend is not something anyone wants to face. Having Dr. Darden come to help me transition Dublin at home, in his own backyard, made the process a little less painful.”

> “Dr Mary Ann made a tough time easier. Very accommodating and compassionate.”

> “My Zoaye was treated with tender loving kindness as I hoped this experience would be both for her and I. Dr.Darden was very patient and compassionate . She truly made our experience one we can look back on and smile even in such a hard time. Thank you for being a friend 🧡”

> “Dr Leverone was the best.”  
>  “He was kind, compassionate and professional. He nicely explained process as he went along and my cat Dewey was comfortable throughout procedure. It could not have gone any easier. I will recommend this service to others. Again, the Dr was exceptional.”

> “Thank you Dr. Decter for making such a painful process so easy. Our Cooper got to cross the rainbow bridge at home while laying on his favorite blanket. There aren’t enough words to describe how grateful I am to have this as my first pet loss experience. Thank you so so much.”

> > “Dr Leverone, I do not want to bother you, but wanted to thank you and let you know how wonderful we all thought you were with us and especially Tedy. You made a very difficult situation better. This was even better than our last experience with home euthanasia. You will be recommended by us anytime your services are needed. I will look on your website to see if there is something I can put on there. I just wanted to say thank you so much from all of us, and especially our Tedy.”

> “Dr. Holly made a difficult situation less difficult. We loved our Snoopy, but it was time for him to run free. Dr. Holly was patient, kind, and explained what was going to happen. We had time with our pup which was important. I cannot recommend Dr. Holly enough! She is truly the best!”

> “Realizing we would have to say goodbye to our beloved and last golden retriever Violet was unexpected and even more devastating being it was Christmas Eve.  
>  Dr. Holly Pietschmann responded via text immediately and stayed in contact throughout the morning as she communicated her anticipated arrival.  
>  Our daughter and grand kids arrived at the same time as Dr. Holly to say their goodbyes. She removed herself and allowed the kids to give Violet some treats and say goodbye.  
>  Once, they left she gave us our time and told us to let her know when we were ready. We had Christmas music playing and tears flowing as we told our Violet how much she was loved and would be missed.  
>  When we gave the word, Dr. Holly explained what she would be doing and what would happen. Violet, would be relaxed and then would be snoring. From there she would cross over peacefully as we continued to rub her and speak to her. It was a comforting, relaxing and peaceful experience for us and for Violet in the familar surroundings of our home.  
>  We are forever appreciative of Dr. Holly’s care, compassion, respect and the dignity she gave to us and to our girl Violet.  
>  Being it was Christmas Eve, we expected that things would move quickly so that the Dr. could enjoy her holiday plans. To our great surprise, Dr. Holly was extremely generous with her time and not once did we feel rushed. Again, Dr. Holly thank you, thank you from the bottom of our hearts.”

> “It’s only been 3 weeks. Something small or random still brings me to tears every day.  
>  Today, it was the most beautiful handwritten card from Dr. Jennifer.  
>  I honestly don’t know how she does. What she does. Not only is she so caring and gentle with our babies but that compassion flows in abundance to us ‘humans’ too.  
>  I was not in top condition the day Edie left and Dr. Jennifer navigated through everything with the most amazing presence and calm that I felt at ease in my grief knowing she had everything under control.  
>  It’s an incredible thing you do Dr. Jennifer! Thank You feels weird to say under the circumstances, but I am so grateful that you allowed the authentic emotion of that day be paramount and not for one second was it overshadowed by any ‘procedure’.  
>  Eden will never leave us and having the ability to be at home where she was comfortable is something I cherish.”  
>  Tríona

> “Dr. Gail Larson was so great to have in this time for us. She was able to come out very quickly and was very compassionate. I would recommend her to anyone that has a pet suffering.”

> “This is a year later but wanted to provide a review. The dreaded day had come one Sunday morning and we knew our old boy was ready to go. When I called Pet Loss at Home they were able to come out right away and let us do what we needed as a family to say goodbye. We all laid in the grass and loved on our boy, took our time saying our goodbyes and gave him as many treats as he wanted. The Vet did a great job explaining the process and what was happening at each step to assure us he wasn’t in pain or what was happening was normal. When he was gone she didn’t rush us or make us feel like we had a time limit. She truly showed compassion and empathy. She even lined up the cremation person to be there at the same time to take him away. During a horrible situation she made it a lot less stressful and I appreciated that we didn’t need to stress our old boy out or cause additional pain by having to drive him to the clinic for an emergency visit. I know the cost to euthanize at home is more expensive than doing it in the clinic but the overall experience was so much better and you can grieve in the comfort of your own home (or yard in our case). Highly recommend Pet Loss at Home if you ever are in the situation we found ourselves in. Thank you, I can’t express how thankful we are that there is a service like you.”

> “Dr. Decter is amazing. So caring and empathetic. With her help our beautiful boy crossed over the rainbow bridge. It was calm, done with kindness and care. Dr. Decter walked us through every step of the process. We could not be more grateful.”
> 
> Thank you, Dr. Decter.

> “Dr. Ong is very compassionate and kind and was the perfect vet to help me say goodbye to my best friend and pet. Her staff is very compassionate also. I didn’t have any notice, so they put me on a cancellation list and Dr. Ong herself called me and fit us in for same day service. Her kindness to my darling pet really helped his transition to heaven.”
> 
> Thank you Dr. Ong.

> “Some difficult circumstances required us to euthanize our beloved 13 year old German Shorthair Pointer on short notice and on a weekend. I left a message on Saturday morning. Within a couple hours Dr Leverone called and made an appointment for Sunday. While painful it was a great relief to my wife and I to terminate the pain of our best friend.  
>  Dr Leverone called Sunday to confirm before he came and was efficient and fully explained the process after arriving. We would highly recommend Dr. Leverone if you are in similar circumstances. Thank You Dr. Leverone for assisting us during a difficult situation!!”

> “My golden retriever, Buddy, was seen my Dr. Phil Whisnand. He was almost 12 years old. Dr. Whisnand was very detailed in explaining the process. It was a difficult to sit there and watch what was happening but he was reassuring that Buddy would go peacefully. When it was time to say goodbye he was so kind.”
