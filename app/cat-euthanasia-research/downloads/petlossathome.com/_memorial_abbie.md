# In Memory of Abbie

Abbie

We got Abbie when she was just a few weeks old. She was born on May  
10th 2002 and we got it on 4th of July weekend of 2002. My oldest  
daughter Amanda had picked her out of the litter she was the smallest  
runt of the litter. She didn’t have the full markings of the Yorkie pool  
like the other brothers and sisters. The father was a full Yorkie in the  
mother was a full black poodle. We were super excited to bring her home  
and she brought so much joy to our family for many many years. Abbie  
definitely was a lap dog. She loved everybody especially men. Never  
really a Barker and always laid back. She grew up with several years  
with a cat and we believe that she thought she was a cat. Licking  
herself like a cat and sunning herself in the Sun. Everybody love Abbie  
and she is truly missed by many many people. Pets are definitely like a  
part of your family and when you lose one you grieve for missing them.  
No words can express the love I had for my dog.
