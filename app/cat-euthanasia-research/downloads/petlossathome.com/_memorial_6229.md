# In Memory of Kaya

Kaya

Thank you so much Dr. Rachel Thauberger for making this very difficult time more bearable through your very calm and compassionate demeanor. I cannot thank you enough for returning my phone call on a Friday night at 10 pm, past your normal working hours and last minute notice, and agreeing to come to my home to put my baby to rest at 11:30-11:45 pm. After the horrible traumatic last 24 hours of her life, the last 15 minutes of it was very peaceful and calm, as it should have been. That gave me so much comfort, I cannot repay you for that gift. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
