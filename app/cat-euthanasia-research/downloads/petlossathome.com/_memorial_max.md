# In Memory of Max

Max

After 15 yrs. 8 mos., I had to say goodbye to the love of my life Max.  
This was one of the hardest decisions I had to make as to when it was time. My Max and I  
had our very own special communication between us until the very end. I know he is now pain free, cancer free and has the use of his legs again. Thank you for making this transition for my boy to Rainbow Bridge so wonderful. I will highly recommend your service.
