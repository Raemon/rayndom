# In Memory of “Pudd”

“Pudd”

“Sad times amongst the kingdom: “Ye Ole Dragon” slays her final fight tonight, after 18 years of dedicated fending of Evil. She ventures onward to Heavenly Gates, where she will meet those that came before her. She will share stories of Battle; Majestically alerting the Citizens of the Winged Blue Beasts that dared fly upon her Land/Valiantly defeating the Demon Wasps that breached her Castle walls/Conquering the notorious Flys & Moths that penetrated her domain.”

Gallantly defending the terrain yet, always compassionate & comforting throughout turmoil.

Rest easy my friend. We shall rejoin in the next Realm.
