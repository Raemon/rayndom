# In Memory of Daisy

Daisy

This image was taken by my son Saturday, Oct. 6th. I had received a shocking diagnosis the week before of terminal secondary lung cancer. I haven’t even grasped the cancer diagnosis. She took a dramatic downward turn Sunday morning and I had my baby girl put to sleep Sunday afternoon. She died in my arms. No words.

I didn’t rescue her. She rescued me. I’m utterly lost. Daisy my beloved girl…….
