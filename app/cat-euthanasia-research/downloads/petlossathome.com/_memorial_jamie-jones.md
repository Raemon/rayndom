# In Memory of “Jamie” Jones

“Jamie” Jones

My Sweet Boy. He came to his forever home on 2/21/06 from Tri-Valley Rescue, and he was a joy to have from day one. He did not like change – at all – a cat who definitely liked the status quo. So to have your “service at home” be available was a godsend. I know he passed peacefully, and I also know that he knew he was loved.  
Thank you again.  
Susan Jones
