# In Memory of “Simon” Liu

“Simon” Liu

We had to say goodbye to our beloved 17 yr old kitty Simon (lymphoma) on Valentine’s Day. He was the best cat and I miss him more than I can describe. He was our last pet because he didn’t really get along with our two dogs and our female cat that passed before him. For the past year he’s enjoyed a wonderful retirement as the only pet. I’m so thankful for the 14 years we had with him.
