# In Memory of Liberty

Liberty

Our beautiful old girl passed away very quietly and peacefully at home 7 April in the loving arms of her family. Our home is so very empty but I know she is now pain free and happy, running around in a better place–and probably scaring the wits out of people as she loved to do! She was very much loved and already greatly missed. Our deepest gratitude to the amazing local vet, Dr. Allegra Liu, who helped Liberty and our family through the process with compassion, kindness and peace. We are extremely grateful.
