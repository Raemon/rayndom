# In Memory of Salem

Salem

Salem was a great dog! We drove 14 hours one way to pick her up as a six  
week old puppy. She was loved from day one! She loved to go for runs,  
chase her big red Kong ball, go to the cabin and play with our three  
children. Actually, all three of our kids learned how to stand by  
holding onto her fur! She loved to lay on our leather couch and watch TV  
and eat the scraps on the floor that our toddler would drop to her. We  
will miss her terribly but know that she is at peace and we will see her  
again.
