# In Memory of Boots

Boots

This is Boots. He was the most friendly cat I have ever met. His favorite thing to do was go from lap to lap, and whenever he would start to dose off he would gently pet you back until he fell asleep. Even as he got older he still loved to wrestle with the dog, and surprise attack her from around the corner. As a self proclaimed “not cat person” he was the one he changed my mind.
