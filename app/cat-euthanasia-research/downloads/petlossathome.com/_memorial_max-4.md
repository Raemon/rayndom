# In Memory of “Max”

“Max”

Max, Sweetest baby boy ever. Three years just wasn’t enough but everyday we got to spend with you we’re filled with happiness and love and for that we are thankful. I love you so so so much. Forever in our hearts. Rest In Peace my love. I love you so much, thank you for letting me your dog mom it was such an honor to take care of you. I’ll see you again in heaven with Jesus. I love you.

Love,  
Gabby, Noe, Estefany, Adriana, Belinda, Junior, Manny, Mami, and Alfredo
