# In Memory of “Daisy”

“Daisy”

“Today we said our hardest goodbye to our beautiful Daisy. She spent 15 years as my little shadow. Whether in a warm bed or on the cold concrete, her favorite place to be was by my side. She went from the cutest puppy ever to the sweetest little old lady. She was the queen of the house, and she lived the best life. I hated making this decision but I know this was the right one. No more pain for our little girl. Our hearts are aching right now. My little Noodles, I will love you forever. Run free, Baby Girl.”
