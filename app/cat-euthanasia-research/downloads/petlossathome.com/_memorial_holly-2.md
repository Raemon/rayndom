# In Memory of “Holly”

“Holly”

(April 14, 2012-January 5, 2020)

Our sweet Holly lived a life of happiness and love. We adopted her in Hawaii in February of 2014, a year after we adopted her brother, Batman. She was so wild-spirited and full of love, and she’s loved our son since his birth almost five years ago. One of the unique qualities that she had was her smile. You couldn’t help but fall in love with her. As fresh and as raw as the pain is for us all, I’m so grateful for Dr. Henehan for coming to our home so he could help her pass peacefully on her favorite couch. She was surrounded by love and comfort, and even though her life was short-lived, her love and memory will live on forever in our hearts. We love you and miss you, sweet Holly Bear!

Love always and forever,

Daddy, Mommy, Jackson, and Batman
