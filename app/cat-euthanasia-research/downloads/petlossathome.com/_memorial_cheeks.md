# In Memory of Cheeks

Cheeks

Dr. Hani Soliman and his technician Michael helped to ease our beloved cat (Cheeks) transition from the here to the hereafter. Both were compassionate and caring to Cheeks… and were very mindful of “us” considering one is struggling and not at their best for such an event. They explained everything to us beforehand so we knew the technical aspect and what to expect. Cheeks was calm throughout – I do not believe the experience was difficult for Cheeks and I have had an encounter with an in home pet euthanasia that was. This restored my faith in in home euthanasia. Dr. Soliman and Michael did not rush… they let us dictate the time frame both before they began and after which allowed my mother to sit with Cheeks in her arms until she was truly “ready” to let go. Cheeks was and will forever be “priceless” to us. Ensuring her departure was indeed pain free and full of love and compassion was well worth it. I highly recommend Dr. Soliman and Michael. May God bless them for their help and guidance illuminating the way for our little loved ones over the Rainbow Bridge.
