# In Memory of Weasel

Weasel

My constant companion for 18.5 years. Weasel was a very special cat that I got when I was 9 yrs old. She has been my rock and my safe place through so many life events–from middle school anxieties, to college stress, the loss of a dear friend, and more recently my happy marriage. Weasel loved to cuddle and always wanted to be by my side. She had an odd love of plastic (licking/laying on it proudly) and of boxes. I often called her my angel kitty because she was such a blessing in my life. It was comforting to be able to be with her at the end, holding her and letting her know how much we love her.
