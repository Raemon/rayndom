# In Memory of “Pickles”

“Pickles”

If you knew Pickles, you loved Pickles. This sweet old man came into our lives 3 years ago already fragile and malnourished. He was stuck in the snow, and we brought him in. Pickles spent his days cuddled up to us or his fur friends, drinking out of his water bowl, and studying the treat cabinets. He was the best singer in the house, and showed us his talents in the middle of the night. Pickles was our best buddy. He added so much to our home. Forever in our hearts 💜
