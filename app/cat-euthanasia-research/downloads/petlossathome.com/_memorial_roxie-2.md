# In Memory of “Roxie”

“Roxie”

In loving memory of our sweet Roxie. Forever in our hearts. “You no longer greet me, as I walk through the door. You’re not there to make me smile, to make me laugh anymore. Life seems quiet without you, you were far more than a pet. You were a family member, a friend, a loving soul I’ll never forget. You were a great companion, constant, loyal and true. My heart will always wear the pawprints left by you.”
