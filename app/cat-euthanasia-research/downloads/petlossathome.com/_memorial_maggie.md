# In Memory of Maggie

Maggie

It’s never easy saying goodbye to your pets; They’re family, and life is never the same when it’s time to say goodbye. Having Dr. O’Leary come to our home to make our Maggie spend her last moments in a place she felt safe and happy, surrounded by all who loved her was such a wonderful thing to be able to give her in her last moments. Thank you for everything!  
-Patrick M. and Stephanie H.
