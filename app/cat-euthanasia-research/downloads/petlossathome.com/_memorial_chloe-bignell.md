# In Memory of “Chloe” Bignell

“Chloe” Bignell

This is our Chloe, our “little kitten” as she was so lovingly nicknamed because she was such a petite little girl. The love, laughter and joy she brought throughout the 15 years of our lives together will always be treasured. We love and miss her very much.
