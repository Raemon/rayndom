# In Memory of “Siren”

“Siren”

“For the past almost 10 years, Siren brought the brightest light into my life- making even the worst days bearable. I think everyone that met her probably has a little more love in their heart because of her.”

“How lucky I am to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard”

Rest in Peace my sweet girl. I will carry you in my heart for the rest of my days. I love you.

Siren Roo
