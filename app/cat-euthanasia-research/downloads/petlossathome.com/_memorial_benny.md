# In Memory of Benny

Benny

When my family first adopted Benny 10 years ago, he was a skittish and forlorn dog who struggled to even wag his tail most days. However, within several months of being a part of our family Benny became an incredibly rambunctious dog with an upbeat and distinctive personality. He loved playing with other dogs and cuddling with my mother and he occasionally got comically attached to his bones and treats. My family will always remember Benny as the crazy dog who never failed to make us laugh and was always more than willing to be pet when we were sad. Special thanks to Dr. O’Leary for allowing Benny to pass in the comfort of his own home.
