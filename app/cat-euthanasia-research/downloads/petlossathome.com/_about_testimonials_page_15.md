> We can not thank Dr. Leah Osowiecki enough. My family and I had to face the difficult decision of having to put down our 6 year old puppy. He was diagnosed with cancer in June and received chemo treatment until September when there was nothing else we were able to do besides keep him comfortable at home. Over night in November he woke up unable to walk and very weak, heartbroken, we knew what we needed to do for our dog. We found pet loss at home online and called Dr. O the day after thanksgiving and she was able to come to our house that same night. She texted me throughout the day to check in which was very reassuring. She was very caring and took the time to explain to us what had happened to our dog and how the procedure would happen after after fully examining him. She was very caring and empathetic and was very gentile with our dog. Keeping us informed of everything happening, our dog passed away very peacefully as if he had fallen asleep. We can not thank her enough for being so compassionate and caring towards our family and dog. We highly recommend this service! Thank you Dr. O!

> We recently had to put our precious Lucy to sleep due to a tumor on her heart. Knowing that this tumor could rupture at any time and place Lucy in excruciating pain, we made the decision to have her euthanized at home. Dr. Rachel Thauberger was an angel sent to assist Lucy on her journey to heaven. Dr. Rachel thought of everything to make this as comfortable of an experience for Lucy as well as for my husband and me. She brought treats and pink blankets and walked us through the process in a calm and caring manner. Despite the ultimate outcome, this was a beautiful process that respected Lucy as well as us humans. We received an ink paw print from Dr. Rachel as well as a beautiful package containing Lucy’s ashes and a clay paw print. If you have to go through this, Dr. Rachel is the best, most caring and compassionate vet you could ever ask for.

> When the time came, Dr. Darden and Pet Loss at Home were there for us. I had written down the names and numbers of mobile vets for the inevitable demise of our sick dog, but when we knew one evening that her time had come I was not expecting to get an appointment for a day or two. Dr. Darden was at my house within an hour.
> 
> Her gentle beside manner helped put me and my wife at ease during the difficult decision, afterwards when we said our final goodbye, and when delivering my dogs remains a week later. She is experienced and knows what you are going through, and treats your home and your dog’s memory with respect. This was my first time putting a pet down, and I couldn’t imagine how much harder it would have been without a pro like Dr. Darden guiding me.

> Dr. Allegra Lui was Genuine, professional, caring with our little friend in her end -of-suffering. Highly recommend.

> When it became clear that our beautiful boy Sparky was suffering with no more reasonable therapies to pursue, we knew it was time. For our own privacy and for Sparky’s well being, we search for a veterinarian who would be willing to come to our home. Our experience with Dr. Carrie Moore was exceptional. I would highly recommend her services. Dr. Moore exemplified kindness, gentleness, wisdom and professionalism. She helped all of us more than words can express. We’ll always have a positive memory of Sparky’s transition; on the deck (his favorite place) with sunshine, birdsong, and his family surrounding him.

> I am forever grateful for Dr. Coon making time to come all the way to Shelton and making my geriatric kitty cat Kau’i’s passing peaceful and painless. Not only was it during this Covid 19 pandemic, it was a Saturday before Easter Sunday. Just wow. From the first phone call, she was so caring, genuine and humble. She gave us time to decide on our options. She was there for me when no one else was calling back. The actual experience was so calming and caring. She is great at what she does and has the kindest words for this hard time in your life. The clay paw print was the icing on the cake and she even left clay so I can make them for my toddler boys hands and Kau’is paw in the middle. Thank you for that. My four year old just loves it. I highly recommend Dr. Coon for at home pet loss for the peaceful passing of your pet. Thank you again. It means so much to me and to Kau’i.

> After being contacted Dr. Liu came out the same afternoon to euthanize our beloved dog. She was very compassionate, understanding and caring. She gently sedated him and allowed my wife to hold him as he passed. He passed very quickly.  
>  I would highly recommend Pet Loss at Home.  
>  They care about the pet and the owner.

> It’s never easy to say goodbye to a beloved pet. I was heartbroken to see Dusty struggling with his health the last few months and knew last Saturday it was time to let him go. Given the Covid-19 situation I wasn’t sure what my options would be. I am so thankful I found this service to match families in need to vets who are doing this work to honor our pets lives. Dr. Teague was so kind and patient. Even though I was the last call of a long day, he never made me feel rushed and was so kind and gentle with Dusty. He just brought him home to me. The beautiful wooden box that he is packaged in and a lovely bag and kind note. It makes a heartbreaking occasion a little less sad. I feel like I was able to honor his beautiful life to the end. Thank you so much Dr. Teague.

> A few months ago, Dr. Kelly Garrett helped us to bring our much loved beagle, Jamie, to his final rest. Dr. Garrett’s kind, gentle approach with Jamie gave us such comfort. We know that we did the best thing that we could for Jamie in bringing Dr. Garrett to our home to help us with his final day. Thank you.

> Dr. Christina Kinkade – We can not say enough about how grateful we are to have found your service and to have had the services of Dr. Kinkade! It’s never easy to say goodbye to a beloved pet. We were heartbroken when our 7 year old dog, Mia was diagnosed with cancer and went downhill fast. We were told by the vet hospital that she was suffering and should be euthanized, but with Covid-19, it would not be possible for us to be there. Our regular vet, Dr. DeMarco of Kingston Animal hospital told us about Pet Loss at Home. I am so thankful I found this service to match families in need to vets who are doing this work to honor our pets lives. Dr. Kinkade was amazing!!! She was so very kind and patient with us and with our pet. Her gentle, kind nature and the knowlege she imparted made this process so much more bearable, and what a difference to be able to say goodbye our four-legged family member at home. It made this heartbreaking situation a little less sad. I feel like we were able to honor Mia’s beautiful life with a beautiful ending. Thank you SO MUCH Dr. Kinkade!!

> Dr. Leverone provided extremely gentle and humane service to my beloved 13 year old Labradoodle, Ozzie, and I can’t recommend him highly enough. From the minute he came to the door I knew that it was the right decision to contact him. Dr. Leverone patiently explained exactly what he would be doing and what to expect, and his professional yet kind manner made everything easier. I really felt like he cared about Ozzie and wanted to make sure the experience was respectful to both Ozzie and me. I could not have asked for a more peaceful end, and I thank Dr. Leverone for making that possible.

> Saying goodbye to Maximus was the hardest thing I had to do in years, and I wanted him to be comfortable in his own home when we had to do it. Dr. Whisnand was patient and very comforting during the entire process.

> Words cannot express the gratitude we have for Dr Mary Ann Bender. The quick return call and the same day visit on a weekend made our decision much easier.  
>  Sitting on the living room floor with my baby in my lap, was the most beautiful way we could say goodbye.  
>  No stress for her and no stress for us.  
>  We hurt because she is gone but smile because she is at peace.

> I want to thank Dr Alicia Darden for being very kind and compassionate and for the long drive to our house to put my sweet Labrador Dakota to rest. He had an a very aggressive cancer that came on suddenly and took him within two weeks. I was/am heartbroken I had him for 12 wonderful years and he was playing and running until this awful cancer struck. She brought Dakota’s ashes and clay and ink paw prints back to me. I highly recommend this service there is no good place to lose your best friend but letting him go at home was so much better than the cold environment of a vet office.

> Tonight Dr. Durfee came to our home and helped us take care of our Boxer of 14 years. He was so professional and the experience couldn’t have been better given the circumstances. It was our first time experiencing this, and I am forever grateful it was done as it was. In home is definitely the way to do this Procedure. Thank you again.

> My family was very impressed with how you gracefully handled the situation with kindness and respect. It was a beautiful, peaceful passing.
> 
> Thank you again.

> Compassionate, professional, Dr. Rachel explained everything before it happened. Letting you know what to expect. Our buddy rocket is at peace. Thank you Dr. Rachel.

> Seattle: Dr. Coon- Jack and I want to extend our sincerest gratitude to you for your kindness, professionalism and tenderness as you helped our beloved Hank cross from this life to the rainbow 🌈 Bridge.
> 
> It was such a difficult decision because he was so happy and lively even at age 7 1/2. Your guidance and compassion helped make an unbearable decision easier. He will be missed terribly and forever by our entire family. But we are so thankful we had an opportunity to be with him as he passed even during this challenging coronavirus crisis. Thank you for helping to make that possible. God Bless you and we pray you stay safe and healthy as you provide this meaningful service. 🙏🏻✝️ Debra & Jack Behrens

> Seattle: Dr. Sandy Coon – I just wanted to thank Dr. Coon for coming out during this difficult time to help our sweet Kirby yesterday. It was an incredible gift to both me and him that he could pass in our home being held by his family. I can’t tell you how grateful I am. Thank you so much for making a difficult time a bit easier.

> Dr. Darden was fabulous. Our friend found her for us, as we weren’t truly prepared to have to make the decision so quickly. But Dr. Darden came and explained the process, and was VERY patient with us. She is compassionate and caring, and you can tell truly loves family. And our pets are so much part of our family. Thank you Dr. Darden for making this just a little bit easier, when there is nothing easy about losing a loved one.

> Denver: Dr. Robin Teague – I am so glad to have found your service today. I tried to call 5 different services, to find someone to come to my home to end the suffering of my dear, sweet, bunny, Charlie. I wanted to make sure that it was done at home, so that his mate Matilda (Tilly) could be there with him, and to make it as comfortable for not just Charlie, but our whole family.
> 
> Dr. Teague met all of Charlie’s house mates, and was not rushed to do anything. When he went in to visit Charlie in his room, Matilda did not run and hide as she does with ALL strangers. I have never seen her stand her ground, but she sat inches away while he met with Charlie and while performing the service. That is huge!
> 
> Charlie was a very active, fun, friendly bunny that lived a good long life and will be sorely missed by us all.
> 
> As an aside, I started yesterday looking for a service. I was told by some that they do not have services for rabbits, others were out of town for te long weekend, and one another who never returned my call.
> 
> It broke my heart to see Charlie dying slowly, but it would have been too stressful for both Matilda and Charlie to be taken from the home. It was absolutely great, that Dr. Teague was the one to answer my call. Charlie could not have been in more caring hands.
> 
> Thank you so much for allowing everyone in the family be there to help Charlie (and me) at such a difficult time. My gratitude for the service you provided us cannot be stress enough.
> 
> Thank you from all our family! Jet, Tiger, Raven, Rudy, Marilyn and mostly from Matilda and Charlie.
> 
> Dr. Robin Teague veterinarian helped Charlie
