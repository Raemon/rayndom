# In Memory of “Momo” Hutchins

“Momo” Hutchins

No words can explain the loss we feel without you around. You were a  
huge part of our daily lives. You wake us up in the morning especially  
if we sleep in. You greet us happily each and every time no matter how  
we look, smell or feel. You know when we’re sad and you lick away our  
tears. You’ve seen the bad times and you were a part of all the good  
times. You will always be our 80-pound lap dog and king of the couch  
cuddles! Our hearts are broken and what keeps us going is the thought  
that you are no longer in pain. WE LOVE YOUR FOREVER, MOMO! We will  
never forget you. Thank you for coming into our lives.
