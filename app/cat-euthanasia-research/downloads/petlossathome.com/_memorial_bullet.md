# In Memory of “Bullet”

“Bullet”

“Words can’t describe what a great dog our Bullet was. For our first furry animal, he was loved by so many of our friends and family and even touched other dog parents on his nonchalantness and just ability to be big and adorable at the same time. Bullet was very smart, the only thing we wish he could do is stay away from mango seeds!! Bullet was like a son/brother to us, and he is deeply missed.. We hope he keeps our other Angels company <3 We love you Bullet forever (:
