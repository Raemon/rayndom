# In Memory of “Ember”

“Ember”

“Ember was a dog with many nicknames, Embie, Emmy Lou, Moose, Moosey, Moo-moo, wiggle butt (for the constant wiggle she always did if you just looked her way) and the list goes on. She was a very loving and loyal dog and acted like a mother to our new born daughter. She will be forever missed.”
