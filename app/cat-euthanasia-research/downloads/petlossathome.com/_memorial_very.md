# In Memory of Very

Very

“Very” was fearless and a true warrior princess. Her loyalty and steadfast love were my greatest comforts. I knew that there was nothing in the world she loved more than me. And I loved her back with my whole heart. You will never be forgotten, guardian of my love, my perfect kitty “Very Beautiful”. Always yours forever and ever…Ina

**“Very Beautiful” Ina’s Cat From Greater San Francisco Area**
