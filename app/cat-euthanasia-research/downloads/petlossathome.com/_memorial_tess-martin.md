# In Memory of “Tess” Martin

“Tess” Martin

From the day I brought Tess home, I knew she would always have my heart. She was so full of life and love. I knew from the beginning she was special. As the years passed on, she became my right arm. She was my sidekick. I couldn’t make a move without her bouncing up with me. She knew every sound, like the sound of my computer turning off, and she knew what to do with every sound. I have the luxury of working at home and there was never a day she didn’t spend with me in my office. I am so thankful for Gail and that she was able to give her what she deserved, and that’s to pass in her own home without having to go through the stress of going to the vet. I am so thankful that she carried her away with the dignity that she deserved. I am so thankful for the time I had with Tess. RIP my little one and know I’ll love you always.
