> I just wanted to express my gratitude to the amazing woman that helped my family say good bye to my beloved dog. Ripley was 18 and after so much denial she finally told me (in her way) that she was ready to embark on her next journey I called Pet Loss at Home and was put in touch with Dr. Danton. She came to my home and helped me say good bye in the most compassionate, beautiful manner I could ever have hoped for. She had us talk about our fondest memories as the medication did its job so that we could have something beautiful to remember at this sad time. I will forever be thankful to her for her compassion. She is a beautiful human being and we are very lucky to have her. Thank you for this amazing service.

> During a time of great need and sadness an angel came to use and his name was Dr. Phil. I could not have entrusted anyone else with my beloved Pinta ending her time here on earth. Pinta was a beloved member of our family for over 12 years. Thank You Dr. Phil for assisting us with what had to be done. Your care and attention to Pinta’s needs did not go unnoticed. I will end this note knowing that Pinta went to heaven in the most humane way possible and with as much comfort we could provide her with by her passing among her surroundings and with people who loved her close by. Thank You Dr. Phil for all you did. My tears now are bittersweet, times of sadness mixed with many, many happy memories.

> Dr. Darden,  
>  My family and I want to thank you for coming to our apartment last minute and assisting with the peaceful passing of our baby Charlie this past Monday. As you know, this was the hardest decision of our lives. I’ve never encountered the pain of loosing a pet, but having Charlie at home in our arms during this transition gave me a sense of peace with my decision. Thank you for your kindness, professionalism, empathy, and understanding to our situation. May God bless you as you continue to help other families through this painful process. We appreciate you.

> “Thank you Dr Sandra this was very peaceful and loving….. Even though our hearts are heavy we’re also filled with the love and the care that she had these last few moments with us so thank you… What you do is truly a blessing to families like ours.”
> 
> Thank you

> “The wife and I were a little hesitant in using a referral site such as this. But we were both overwhelmed with professionalism and compassion from Dr. Alicia Darden. She services the Atlanta area and she’s hands down amazing! If your considering using her do not hesitate one second! May our girl (Boo/Sheba) rest in piece.”

> Dr. Rachel just left my house with my Cherio. She was so kind and caring., not just to Cherio but to us, too. She took such good care of him.

> “In the hardest time of my life, Dr. Rachel was incredibly kind, patient and responsive. I hate that anyone might need her services but I recommend her from the bottom of my heart. She made the whole process less traumatic and made my girl’s final moments peaceful and in the comfort our our own home.”

> Thank you for the kind words Sandra, and alleviating a terrible time as well as it could possibly be. Again, thanks.

> Dr. Rachel was amazing in helping our English Mastiff pass over the rainbow bridge. It was such a difficult decision but Dr. Rachel did the best she could to put us at ease and create a peaceful experience. Not having to take my pet into a vet made the entire experience less stressful and allowed our beloved family member to have his last memory be in his home with his entire human and furr family. Thank you for being so kind to our Moosey.

> I would like to take a moment to thank Dr. Lou for his timely, compassionate, and professional care during the transition of our beloved Persian cat. We feel fortunate to have found Dr. Lou in our time of need. It is comforting to know that a valued member of our family was in the best hands possible; and we appreciate that he transitioned while at home with us, on his favorite couch. Dr. Lou’s expert handling of every step and his helpful recommendations on next steps was crucial in easing the burden for us at this difficult time.  
>  Thank you.

> Dr. Bender was very helpful and gracious in helping us make our dog’s passing peaceful and respectful. Our dog’s health took a very quick, serious decline, and Dr. Bender made room for us in her schedule to help him pass. We are very grateful to have her service so that our dog could pass at home, where he was comfortable and happy.

> Thank you for helping us with Napster and your kindness.

> Dear Dr. Danton,
> 
> I just want to thank you for making my goodbye to China as tolerable as it could be. I appreciate you so much for coming so quickly. I could not have gone to work and left her the next day. I know you are used to tears; but I was a mess. You made it easier for me to cry and not try to hold it in as I would’ve if I had to drag her to a “storefront”. You ROCK! So glad to have met you.

> Dr. Mendelsohn was the absolute best. It is so difficult losing a 4 legged friend. She was very good about telling us the next step in the process. I can’t thank her enough for the care she gave me and my wife. We lost our boy of 13 years and she made the process easier although still difficult. I was too distraught to give her a hug but I hope that she knows she helped us immeasurably. Anyone in this situation should consider this method. At least our guy left this world in his home surrounded by those who loved him and in his own home. Crosby, we will miss you everyday. Much love for you.

> Our girl went over the rainbow bridge. Chelsea brought so much love to us and we thank her for the wonderful years she gave us. We are heartbroken but now she is will her sister again and she can see and we know she is having fun! We will forever miss you sweet girl and you most definitely let paw prints on our hearts. We love you, Mommy and Daddy.  
>  This was a hard decision to let our sweet girl go but when I called Dr. Tracey Decter answered the phone and she was compassionate. When she came to our home she explained everything and was gentle! We can’t thank her enough.

> Our sweet beagle mix was diagnosed with kidney disease 3 months ago. She was progressively getting worse even with all the meds she was taking. We knew it was time to let her go. I called Pet Loss at Home and Dr. Tami picked up the phone right away. She explained the process and within 2 days (we are about 45 min outside of Pittsburgh) she came out. Dr. Tami was so sweet & caring & understanding. She made the process peaceful and meaningful. It was so much better than my past experience of taking a dog to a Veterinary office. Then today I received a cute card in the mail from both doctors letting us know they are both sorry for our loss. It’s hard enough to say goodbye to a four-legged family member. But having it done in your home with a caring Veterinarian makes it just a little bit better.

> Dr. Laurelle,
> 
> Thank you for all the loving care you provided for our precious Clarence last August and especially on Tuesday (3/9/21) when you helped him gain his wings.
> 
> We appreciate your kindness, gentleness, and patience to all of us that difficult day.
> 
> Thank you also for the lovely card along with the poem.
> 
> Psalms 56:8
> 
> “You keep track of all my sorrows. You have collected all my tears in your bottle. You have recorded each one in your book.”
> 
> Psalms 57:10
> 
> “…your unfailing love is as high as the heavens. Your faithfulness reaches into the clouds.”

> Dr. Larson came by this morning to help our 15 year old Shiba pass over. She was incredibly compassionate. She let us take our time with him and say our goodbyes. The process went very well and she did a great job explaining each step of the way. We could not have asked for a better experience. To everyone and anyone considering Pet Loss At Home, you will have no regrets doing so, it is the best decision to be had. Thank you again, Dr. Larson for helping me and my family during this very hard time.

> Dr. Darden was the angel we needed during this difficult time. She was kind and gentle with our baby, and us. After assessing the situation, she assured us it was time, and that we were making the best decision for our sweet Grace. God always directs our steps when we cry out to Him, and Dr. Darden was our prayer answered. This was a first time experience for us with in-home transition, and I could not have asked for a better Dr. to guide us. Thank you Dr. Darden for your kindness, gentleness, compassion, and willingness. You will never know what it meant to us on Sunday.

> Helping my old gal cross the rainbow bridge was undoubtedly the hardest decision I’ve ever had to make. But there came a time when I had to set my selfish reasonings aside and realize that she was holding on only because I wasn’t ready to let her go. When I finally came to grips and scheduled a home visit with caring pathways, I was so impressed with the level of care they showed us. The vet that came to my house (Eddie) was incredibly attentive to my specific requests and took the time to get to know Ruby and I. He thoroughly explained the process in a respectful and caring manner, AND listened to me weep/laugh while telling stories about the adventures we’d had during her life. It meant a lot to me that he took the time to get to know ruby and made her feel comfortable about a new person in her house. He patiently waited while I said my many goodbyes, and gave me time alone with her afterward so I could let the rest of the pack visit and gain some closure regarding the passing of their matriarch. He was so respectful with her body, wrapping her snuggly in blankets as he put her on the stretcher. And about a week later, I got a handwritten letter from him expressing his condolences and that meant so incredibly much. This process will never be easy, but I wouldn’t trust anyone else when it comes to saying goodbye to the ones Ive loved most. And as sad as the whole situation was, the end of her life couldn’t have been more peaceful, caring, or dignified. Thank you Eddie from the bottom of my heart for everything you did.

> Toby, our lovable Lab of 14 years, was nearing the end of his life with us, and due to his size and lack of mobility, a mobile vet needed to be arranged. Over the period of days waiting for our mobile vet appointment, on Saturday, Toby’s condition became critical and we realized that immediate attention was required. We contacted Dr. Rachel Sundary morning and arranged for a 2 PM Sunday appointment. We stayed up all night with Toby to keep him as comforted as possible and called Dr. Rachel to see if an earlier appointment was possible – which she was able to accommodate.
> 
> Just minutes before Dr. Rachel arrived, Toby died peacefully at home surrounded by his family. Dr. Rachel’s bedside manner was compassionate, caring and very professional. We arranged for cremation and today, hand delivered by Dr. Rachel, were Toby’s ashes in a cedar urn along with a cast of his paw print – a beautiful presentation. Again we were impressed with Dr. Rachel’s compassion and professionalism.
> 
> Dr. Rachel was our savior in a situation that we were feeling quite helpless and without a solution. We highly recommend Pet Loss At Home and Dr. Rachel to all pet owners and we will not hesitate to utilize their services in the future.

> We are so grateful to Dr Mary Ann Bender for helping us through a difficult time with our sweet Lily. She is at peace. We think of her again having a romp in heaven’s woods, terrorizing squirrels and dragging around every rotten log she can. Dr Mary Ann was compassionate and her love for our 4-legged family member was obvious. Thank you.
