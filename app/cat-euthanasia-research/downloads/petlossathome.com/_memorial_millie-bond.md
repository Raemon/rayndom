# In Memory of “Millie” Bond

“Millie” Bond

My best friend, my funniest little girl and my sweetest little lover was this Millie girl. She will always be my “Mill-Bill.” After her third seizure, she couldn’t walk or shake off the pain anymore. Dr. Ong helped make this a comfortable time to say good bye and let me hold my little girl until all of the suffering and complications of old age freed my old friend’s body forever. Thank you Dr. Ong for helping my Millie leave this earth in peace, and for helping me through a very difficult time. With your help, I was able to say goodbye and know that I had made the right decision for my Mill-Bill.

Sincerely, Liz Bond
