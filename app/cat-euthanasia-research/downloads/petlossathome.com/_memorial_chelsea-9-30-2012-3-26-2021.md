“Chelsea” 9/30/2012- 3/26/2021

Our sweet girl went over the rainbow bridge today! Thank you Chelsea girl for the wonderful years you gave us! You were the sweetest girl and brought so much love to us! Although we are left heartbroken we know you are happy being with Maggie again, you can see and play and are not in anymore pain!! You left your paw prints on our heart sweet girl and we will never forget you and the wonderful times we had with you!!! We love you, Mommy and Daddy
