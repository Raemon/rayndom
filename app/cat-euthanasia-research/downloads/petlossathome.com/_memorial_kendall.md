# In Memory of Kendall

Kendall

We saved Kendall from the pound, but really, she saved US. A part of our family for over 13 years, she went through numerous surgeries, diseases and medications…all without complaint. You see, Kendall was all about making US happy. No, wait. She was about making EVERYONE happy. She brought joy to everyone she met, even those so-called non-animal lovers. She kissed, she hugged (hugging was her favorite), she snuggled and she loved. She loved so, so very hard.

She was my rock, my shadow, my companion and my best friend…and there will never be a minute that goes by that I won’t think of her and love her. Play in the snow all you want now, baby girl…?
