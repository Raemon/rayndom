# In Memory of Leela

Leela

…In all my years I have never seen another dog as beautiful as Leela, and since I had received her from a shelter when she was young I will never be able to replace her. She was patient with us and we did what had to be done in my front yard where she would spend hours in the shade watching ….passing from this earth painlessly. I would highly recommend Dr. O’Leary and your service to any one who is in this terrible situation.
