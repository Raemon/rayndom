# In Memory of Doc

Doc

Thank you for coming to our house and giving Doc his relief. The trauma of going to the “evil vets” office would have been too much for him. Having him laid to rest at home was a Godsend. Here’s a photo of Doc and his chihuahua buddy Blue soaking up the sun on the porch. I will recommend Pet Loss At Home to all the pet lovers I know!
