> “Thanks so much for coming to our house, it made things easier.
> 
> I would love for Ozzy to be on there.
> 
> When I think of Ozzy, I just smile. He gave the best hugs and was always by my side. We will miss him dearly.”

> “Dr. Scott performed euthanasia procedures for 2 Pet Parents here at Pet Passages- Lake Orion in our Rainbow Bridge rooms. These Pet Parents didn’t want to have the procedures done at home and they also didn’t want to go to a vet office so Dr. Scott responded here. Dr. Scott used best-practices and was so very kind, caring, compassionate and explained things to the Pet Parents in such a good way.”

> “I am so thankful for Pet Loss at Home and especially Dr. Darden. I have had the unfortunate experiences (many times over) when my furbaby’s are ready to pass, as I have had dogs my whole entire life. This is the very first time I have utilized this type of service and truthfully, I wasn’t sure if I was making a good choice or not. I am here to tell you, this was by far the most any of us could have hoped and wished for! Dr. Darden was compassionate and gave us all the time we needed throughout the whole entire process. It was like she was barely there and our boy got to just be with us and focus on his family. Our whole family got to sit, love on and comfort him, in his own yard, with the sun shining down. It was so peaceful – there was no nervous/anxious transporting to a vet office, dealing with long wait times to be seen and the last moments for him weren’t in strange/sterile room. Thank you again, truly, from the very bottoms of our family’s hearts.”

> Our most heartfelt thanks to Dr. Kinkade for helping us to let go of the best cat to walk the Earth, Raleigh. Her kindness, compassion, calmness and expertise was greatly appreciated. I knew having a vet come to my home would be better for my cat. He was able to go in his own bed, on my husband’s lap. Surprisingly, I also felt so much better in the end, and feel it’s helped me to deal with this loss. Maybe because there was no guilt of the trauma of the pet carrier and vet office. We are so lucky to have been able to do this. I can’t thank you enough.

> Dr. Scott was absolutely wonderful when it came time to say goodbye to our 12 year old dog Mia. Although it was the toughest day it was everything I had wished for. Mia was comfortable with Dr. Scott and was not afraid. She comforted all of us and was very kind and patient through the whole process. Mia was able to stay in my arms throughout the entire process and spent her last minutes in peace. She took wonderful care of her body and transported her directly to the crematorium afterwords. We are forever grateful for her.

> Even though our six year old Golden Retriever, Taco, was very ill, the decision to euthanize him was extremely difficult.  
>  We valued Dr. Carol Ong’s comforting presence from Pet Loss At Home. Her professional qualm, kind and empathetic manner helped us greatly with Taco’s transition. We can’t tell you how much Dr. Ong’s condolence card (which we received a few days later), meant to us. It was such a generous gesture ! We are most grateful!

> “My buddy Finn was diagnosed with Lymphoma and just a couple months later needed Gail. She made the entire process manageable at a time when it’s hard to know what the right decisions are. The process is perfect for the pet you love so much – no pain, no scary trip to the Vet – just slipping away while resting in their favorite place surrounded by their favorite people. It was lovely – thank you Gail!”

> When our sweet 16 year old Doxie “Cocoa” let us know that it was her time to join her sister in heaven, we placed a call to Lap of Love. I was greeted by the kindest, most empathetic lady who gave me the details of the process of helping Cocoa cross the bridge in the privacy of our home. We held her and loved her all day, made her scrambled eggs with cheese, talked to her and cried with her.  
>  Dr. Tiffany arrived and explained the process to us. We cuddled Cocoa and our other Doxie, Java, sat between us to let her best friend know everything would be alright.  
>  After her relaxation injection I leaned in and she kissed my face twice as she fell asleep peacefully. When her heart stopped, we handed her over to Dr. Tiffany who put her in a basket to take her to her private cremation.  
>  Meanwhile, in the next several days I received emails of support and encouragement, condolence cards and shortly after Cocoa’s ashes arrived in a beautifully engraved box. Included are paw prints, a vial with a tuft of her fur, a lovely poem and bookmark.  
>  Having had to put 2 other dogs down in my life, I can assure you, there is no comparison to having had this very private and intimate experience.  
>  Thank you to Lap of Love for your comfort and support.

> Tila was 14, failing in health and we came to the hard decision to let her go. We didn’t want to stress her needlessly and knew home euthanasia would be best for her. Dr. Leverone was wonderful, calming and kind. We’re very thankful and honored to have had Tila for 12 of her 14 years. A very sweet dog that will be missed very much.

> “When the time came, we contacted Pet Loss at Home. Gail Larson quickly returned our request and was able to help us in a timely manner. Gail was professional and gave us the time we needed. Its a hard thing to put down a beloved pet but a little easier when dealing with people who care.”  
>  Thank you Gail.

> I’m not sure I’ve ever had a better experience with any business ever. After calling the phone number and entering a zip code I was transferred to Dr. Tracey Decter, the actual physician who would be performing the procedure.
> 
> She was wonderful, comforting and pretty much everything you’d hope for in a veterinarian. She spoke with me about the procedure, walked me through everything and was patient through any questions or comments I had. We agreed upon a time and I made payment over text messages to her actual cell phone.
> 
> She was punctual and kept us appraised about her arrival time. When she got there she was so kind to our little guy and to us. He had been fading for a while and it was time.
> 
> She was gentle and comforting while performing the procedure. After it was done she left us with dignity and respect. I couldn’t have asked for it to be done better. I couldn’t recommend Pet Loss at Home enough. Wonderful organization!

> “Dr. Mendelsohn was incredibly sweet, informative, and patient with our boy. She explained each step and made sure our sweet cat wasn’t in any pain and went peacefully and quickly. Can’t recommend this service enough. Professional, kind, and empathetic for this tough time in our life.”

> “I’m writing this review on the third year anniversary of my girl, Tessa’s passing.  
>  I’ve been meaning to write a review all of this time but kept putting it off but never forgot how grateful I am to Dr. Carrie Moore.
> 
> Dr. Carrie was amazing. Let me start with the fact I was nervous about Tessa’s end and a stranger being there as Tessa was terrified of strangers. Dr. Carrie arrived timely, she was very soft-spoken, very soft in her presence, Tessa was able to leave without fear of the stranger that was helping her pass. I can’t express how much easier this made Tessa’s transition and made me that much more comfortable doing the dreaded.
> 
> Dr. Carrie was very understanding too. She went on my time frame, she waited for me to say it was time, and even then, before she did the initial injection, she verified I was okay with her helping Tessa pass. Tessa’s passing was painless and stress-free.
> 
> I highly recommend Dr. Carrie, she truly made a bad situation much easier and truly respected both Tessa and me.”

> “I want to thank PET LOSS AT HOME for being the only organization in the Greater Houston area that includes services for Katy, out of the 7 I contacted that claimed they provided
> 
> these services in our area, Pet Loss At Home was the only one that actually included our location as “in area.” This is concerning to me as I;ve been looking for an at home
> 
> palliative service for the last few weeks that later – when it was the time was appropriate – could also perform at home euthanasia. The first two referrals from our vet (who are
> 
> located less than a mile from our home) were listed on their website as servicing our area, but when contacted siad “we dont have a vet in your area at this time.”
> 
> I would also like to personally thank Dr. Carol Ong for the services she provided for Ivan yesterday, and her guideance she provided me over the phone each time I called this week
> 
> attempting to find a service that would come to our home as Ivan deteriorated over the last two weeks. She was very generous with her time, answering the phone personally each
> 
> time I called this week, and demonstrated Ivan’s comfort and care was her primary priority. She is excellent at what she does. I cannot express my gratitude to her.”

> I lost so much of my heart on June 13, 2021 when the time came to let go, I just needed to say that Alicia was so great to come to our RV camp spot, Aries was truly in her happy place there with us, it meant so much to us being able to give her that comfort at the most difficult time. Aries had a wonderful life taken too early by cancer. As difficult as it was, the easy part was the final arrangements. So grateful for learning about your organization, all the time, care, & little extras put into what ya’ll do really did make such a painful situation a bit easier.  
>  Thank you, The Robinsons

> “Dr. Leverone kindness and professionalism got us through a very painful time when helping my 14 year old Tessie girl on her last day with us. Driving an hour to my home late at night so she wouldn’t suffer. Our heartfelt gratitude for what he did for her and his genuine sympathy for us.”
> 
> Thank you sir.

> > | “I want to send a special thank you to Dr. Bender. She came and put my dog down the day after thanksgiving and was so caring. She got on the floor and introduced herself to my dog. She explained the entire process for us, asked if we had any questions. She gave us all the time we needed with him before he passed. She made sure he left this realm in the most dignified manor possible. We appreciate she came and did everything. Thank you again for making sure our angel is no longer in pain.”

> Dear Laurelle,

> RIP Molly – Oct 11, 2001 – Nov 13, 2021. The recent past wasn’t a lot of fun for you, but here is a picture from your happier days.  
>  Many thanks to Dr Donna O’Leary who came to our house to help Molly on her way in the most compassionate manner possible

> Dear Dr. Shields,
> 
> We wanted to reach out and thank you for helping us say goodbye to our sweet girl, Jane, last weekend. We can’t imagine how tough a job that is, but your work is so appreciated – since June began showing signs of illness in early summer, she began showing signs of aggression when we’d take her to the vet – very unlike her, and limiting our ability to get the info we needed to help her. When you came to our house and she wagged her tail, we knew she knew you were there to help and that she was ready to go. Being able to say goodbye to her on our couch – her favorite place – was a true blessing – we know her last moments were so comfortable and stress free as possible and that she got the dignified and compassionate goodbye she deserved. We were so lucky to have had almost 10 years, miles of hikes, tons of camping trips and other adventures with her.
> 
> Thank you so much. – Liz and Jason

> “We are extremely grateful for the service provided by Dr. Cassie. Saying goodbye to our sweet girl Stella was so very hard. We had made our appointment and shortly realized we had to move the appointment immediately. Dr. Cassie was accommodating, so Stella did not suffer. We were able to have her at home and not the clinic she was terrified of. Dr. Cassie was compassionate and took our timeline as we struggled a bit to say goodbye. If you can do it at home, I highly recommend Pet Loss at Home.”

> DR. DARDIN WAS SO NICE  
>  SHE CAME THE DAY I CALLED AND THAT WAS ONE HARD CALL TO MAKE . BEAR, OUR 12 YEAR OLD AUSTRALIAN SHEPARD MIX WAS GETTING REALLY ILL FROM MANY COMPLICATED MEDICAL ISSUES . SO INSTEAD OF THE SUFFERING THE CALL WAS THE RIGHT ONE TO MAKE . WE THANK YOU FOR BEING SO PROFESSIONAL AND ARE RELIEVED OUR SWEET FUR BABY IS IN HEAVEN .

> “This was a terrible emotional time, however I could not think of a better way for my dog to cross over. Amy was amazingly caring, and my baby boy passed peacefully in arms. I recommend them highly to anyone having to go through this difficult decision!”
