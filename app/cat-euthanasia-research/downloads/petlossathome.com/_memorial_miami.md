# In Memory of Miami

Miami

On 8/28/2016 Megan C. from petlossathome came out and put down my dear cat Miami. I got Miami when she was about 11 years old and had her for about 4 years, her reaching the approximate age of 15 or so. Megan was a true professional expert in her field, very kind and understanding….no one could have been better at putting down my dear cat. Thank you so much.
