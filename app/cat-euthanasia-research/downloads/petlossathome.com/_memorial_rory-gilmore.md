# In Memory of “Rory” Gilmore

“Rory” Gilmore

Our Rory, little girl, passed away on September 7 in St Paul, MN. Her life was full…15 years and one month. She was the best of show at the pumpkin festival. She will always be missed but not ever, no, never forgotten. What a smile…and she could tell a joke.
