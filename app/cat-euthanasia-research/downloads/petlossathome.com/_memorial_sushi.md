# In Memory of Sushi

Sushi

This is our little princess who adopted us 19 years ago. She wandered onto our patio and my husband said don’t feed her. And I’m sure you know the rest of the story. She was a wonderful caregiver to my husband as he had kidney failure, and ironically, so did sushi. I want to think Dr. Carrie more for her thoughtfulness and compassion and helping us through this.

So she will be missed by quite a large family. She had us all trained.
