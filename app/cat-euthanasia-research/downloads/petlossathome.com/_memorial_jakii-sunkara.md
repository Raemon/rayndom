# In Memory of “Jakii” Sunkara

“Jakii” Sunkara

JAKII SUNKARA  
2001-July 10, 2016

Good bye Jakii, old friend. Words cannot describe how much you will be missed. You taught us so much about love, friendship, and courage. Rest in peace dear one. Our beloved Jakii was fifteen. She put up quite a fight against cancer and passed away peacefully at home surrounded by her family.

Thank you Dr.Allegra, for the compassionate way in which you helped make this happen.
