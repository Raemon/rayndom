# In Memory of “Sarge”

“Sarge”

“Sarge, my baby boy. I was blessed to have you for 12 years. You stayed with me through many trials and comforted me when I felt lost. You made me laugh with your antics and stubborn ways. I take comfort that you are now running and jumping like you used to with Mom in heaven. I will miss you terribly. Love always.”
