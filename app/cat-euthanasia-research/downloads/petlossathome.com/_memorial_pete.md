# In Memory of “Pete”

“Pete”

“If there ever comes a day when we can’t be together, keep me in your heart I will stay there forever”

Pete will always have a place in our hearts and our home. We loved this little guy so much.

Until we see you again Stinky Pete. Hope you’re getting all the belly rubs, fuzzy blankets, squishmallow beds, churro treats and catnip toys in Heaven baby boy.
