# In Memory of Kittenhead Bunnybody

Kittenhead Bunnybody

On March 30th Kittenhead Bunnybody peacefully closed his eyes and took his last breath surrounded by people who loved him after a day of being surrounded by even more people who loved him. Kittenhead was adopted from the Santa Barbara Humane Society when he was 8 weeks old in 2000. Kittenhead was a total cuddlebunny and taught the humans he knew the power of sweetness, the vulnerability and power in showing your tender underbelly, and how wonderful it is to receive pleasure. He was also impossibly cute and a total loudmouth who meowed often with passion and gusto. He will be greatly missed by many and is survived by his cat-companion of ten years, Deputy Glitters, and human companion of 16 years, Krista.
