# In Memory of Jack

Jack

Jack was the definition of a true companion.  
He protected my children and gave all of us unconditional love. He was  
always so happy to see us and wanted to be anywhere and everywhere we  
were. I think sometimes he thought he was a human. He was the perfect  
dog for our family and will always hold a special place in our hearts.  
With love,  
The Cooley Family  
Ryan, Michelle, Brielle, Adalyn, and Cade
