# In Memory of “Charlie”

“Charlie”

Thank you so very much for reaching out and for the incredibly thoughtful card… the kids took turns reading it. Honestly it’s been a rough couple of weeks (mostly for me) and I apologize for the delay in responding. After almost 17 year with Charlie I’m having a hard time being in the house. I see him everywhere.

That being said, I want to thank you for your kind, gentle approach to our goodbye. We were a clear disaster, but it was such a peaceful process and gave us comfort that Charlie was leaving in the best hands. The paw prints look adorable and I am in the process of shadow boxing each of them. Such a sweet reminder.

I’m having a hard time choosing my favorite picture, so I’ll let you choose. He was very photogenic! ☺️He was the best puppy in the history of puppies!❤️
