# In Memory of Knox

Knox

Knox, on May 18, 2011, I watched you when you were born … you came into our home 8 weeks later and brought noting but Love & Joy. 9 months later, you were diagnosed with Epilepsy. It took several months to get the correct medications dosages to regulate you down to 1 seizure per month. During the next 6 years and 10 months, you became my best friend and we were inseparable. You loved every person and animal you came in contact with and you didn’t have a bad bone in your body. Over time, the seizures starting effecting your legs but you kept going pouring out nothing but unconditional love ……… Knox, words cannot describe the pain that we are going through without you here, but we know that the pain you were going through has been put to rest. We Love you, we miss you, you will never ever be forgotten, and you will always be in our hearts …………….  
Rest Peacefully ……….. We Love you
