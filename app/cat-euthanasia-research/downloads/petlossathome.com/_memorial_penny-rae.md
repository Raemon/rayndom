# In Memory of Penny Rae

Penny Rae

Penny Rae had the life of a true queen. While most pet owners choose their pet, Penny Rae chose me, literally. She has been a true companion, my best friend, my protector, the love of my life. 13 years of wonderful memories, loud laughs, and a million cuddles. Alongside our relationship, Penny Rae loved our daddy. Our daddy passed away just 5 months ago and Penny Rae followed. Thankful you’re joining daddy in Heaven. Run free and play with all the “ground squirrels” you want babe. Until we meet again my Bee Bee. Love you so very much and missing you every second of everyday, my love.
