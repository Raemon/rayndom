# In Memory of Bosco

Bosco

Tribute to Bosco  
Our beloved Bosco has crossed over the rainbow bridge on May 7th.  
Our hearts are broken and we are completely devastated.  
He was our baby for almost 15 years and he fought so hard to overcome so many problems,  
but it all became too much for him, so we set him free.  
He gave us unconditional love, loyalty, happiness, and laughter.  
He touched so many lives and made so many people happy with his unique personality,  
and his loving and playful ways.  
We will forever miss him and cherish our wonderful memories of him.  
Rest In Peace my sweet Bosco.  
We know we will see you again someday at Rainbow Bridge.  
I don’t know what we are going to do without you….  
We love you and miss you so much Bosco.  
We will be forever thankful that God blessed us with such a wonderful gift.  
7/18/04 – 5/7/19
