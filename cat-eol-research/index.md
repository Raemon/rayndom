## Cheapest option (to be filled)

## Cheapest option (based on published pricing found)

Assuming a typical adult cat (<20 lbs), the cheapest *published* option we found that includes **in-home euthanasia + private cremation** is:

- Dr. Bennett’s Veterinary House Calls: **$720** (euthanasia + private cremation bundle for <20 lbs)

For comparison (same assumption, and before any travel/after-hours add-ons):

- Compassion Pet Hospice: $530 (euthanasia) + $350 (individual cremation <20 lbs) = **$880**
- Caring Heart Vet: $550 (euthanasia <=60 lbs) + $350 (individual cremation) = **$900** (+ possible travel/after-hours fees)
- Golden Gate Vet: $525 (euthanasia 0-50 lbs) + $150 (body removal/transport) + $300 (individual cremation starts) = **$975**

Cheapest *published* **in-home euthanasia only**:

- Dr. Bennett’s Veterinary House Calls: **$450** (<60 lbs, no cremation)

### Potential mix-and-match note

If you can arrange **private cremation separately** for less than ~$270, then “Dr. Bennett euthanasia-only ($450) + separate private cremation” could beat the $720 bundle. In this research pass we did not find a publicly posted, standalone private cat cremation price list we could cite with confidence, so we did not compute that combined minimum.
