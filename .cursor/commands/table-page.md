# table-page 

create a page that displays a table of all the files in the /downloads/[conversationtopic] folder.

Run the tools/create_conversation_topic.py script to create the conversation topic folder and page components, based on the conversationtopic (if you've already thought of a conversationtopic use that again, otherwise generate a new one).
