# Make CSV

Make a csv in the outputs directory, in outputs/[conversationtopic]/_output[foldername].csv. 

Notes:
- if there's a url associated with row-data, rather than have it as a separate column, make another column a clickable link (usually the first column listing the name or main identifier of the row. But not always if the url is referring to a more specific thing)
